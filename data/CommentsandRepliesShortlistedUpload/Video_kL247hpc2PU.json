O'Reilly \ncontinually cut President Obama off, didn't allow him to answer any \nquestion thoroughly,basically asked Rhetoric questions to make accusations \nwith questions, insult, and ridicule the President because O'Reilly and \nmany other corrupt and race agenda driven politicians already have their \nminds made up on what this country needs to do to be back to their \ndefinition of Normal.

Slavery has been over for a very long time. \nAnyone who was ever was a slave or could have been a slave have long since \npast. You didn't live their life or experience anything they did so you \nhave NO RIGHT what so ever to even compare yourself to them. You Sir have a \nlife of luxury compared to them. You have experienced 0% of post traumatic \nslave syndrome. I dare say the best you have experienced would equate to \nelementary school yard bully name calling.\n\nAn considering how many inventions, music stars, etc have been created in \ngarages or dorm rooms that actually became successful with either no to \nlittle \"Professional Schooling\" Your arguments folds in on itself. \nespecially in this day an age. \n\nFrom the saying you can lead a horse to water but can not make him drink \nholds true in your case. You say you want to help people an help those less \nfortunate than you. Do what those people have done. You make more an help \nmore. Even the Indians would pick up from their hunting grounds when game \nwas barren. From the beginning of time far before any slavery or the word \nexisted. People had two choices. To sit an complain an be without or they \ncould push forward taking chances to succeed.

Your response will be there is well fair and health care \nprovided for the ignorant and lazy people who can't get jobs or refuse to \nwork. How can anyone go to work, eat, live, provide for the family without \nhaving access to any of the things i just listed above?!! They can't. So \nthe country pays people to be poor because they know that if the poor \nweren't taken care of in a society where the poor are created they would \nrebel against the system because they understand when you psychologically \nenslave people they will never bite the hand that feeds them. You can take \na Animal out of his natural habitat and feed him and take care of him and  \nif he understands he needs you to survive he will never attack you until he \ndiscovers a way to survive on his own!

Look I am not \nRepublican and I'm not Democrat, so just stop beofe you type any BS about \nthat or fox news. The fact is this guy in the White House has constantly \nshown that he is going to get his way through either quote \"Bipartisanship \nor my pen\". The guy acts like the government is meant to be his way because \nhe is more knowledgeable than the people. He is a typical politician that \nhas more power than he should and no one to really stop him. He acts as if \nthis healthcare law is going so well, when the truth is that someone like \nme that works, is a single dad, and makes not enough to be middle class but \nnot enough to get any government assistance, who looks at this law for what \nit is, a scam. It is not going well because contrary to News Media, \ndemocrats and some republicans the working American person is not an idiot. \nI don't work for a small business or a new upstart, I work for a company \nthat has been established and is still growing for the past 60 years, yet \nin September I got the letter explaining that the healthcare I had would be \nno longer available and that I had to pick a plan that cost twice as much \nand didn't cover anything that I didn't already have covered except for \nthings I didn't need like mammograms, or OBGYN visits. Meanwhile I couldn't \nafford to pay the rates that were being asked for unless I wanted to forgo \npaying my mortgage so I cancelled my insurance for myself and went to \nMedicaid for my child which I pay full price for. ( For those wondering its \n10 times the amount a person without a job and continues to have kids pays \nfor the same coverage). So I see as does many others exactly what is \nhappening and we also see that this president could give a damn. He is \nacting like a dictator. Unforunately he is not even good at that and keeps \nembarrassing us by getting caught with his pants down.

But \nthe far right acts like he is out to kill America and that everything he \ndoes is somehow wrong. Here is my theory: Faux news and its ilk were so \nmortified at the job Bush did as president. He was quite possibly the \ndumbest president we've ever had. And the \"liberal media\" was hard on \nhim--and rightfully so! So when Obama took office after Bush had absolutely \nwrecked the government (and grown it significantly I might add) they \nresented the fact that a Democrat with a liberal background was now going \nto try to fix their Republican president's problems. Therefore, ANYthing he \ndid was heavily scrutinized and scoffed at because they wanted to make sure \nno one thought he was succeeding in fixing the republicans' mistakes. It \nwas Fox's turn to blast the liberal president because they were tired of \ntrying to defend Bush for eight years. Now, six years later, Fox has taken \nit to the extreme. They've done nothing since the reelection but portray \nObama as Karl Marx or some other radical. Name one time they've defended \nhim. Even after he killed Bin Laden they made sure to give all of the \ncredit to the military and none to him.

Since you appear to be a far \nright lunatic, let's start with killing Bin Laden. Oh, but you'll probably \ngive that credit to Bush (lol). How about actually knowing how to deliver a \nspeech without sounding like absolute inbred scum--like Bush. Having Bush \nbe the face of the US made the entire country look completely backwards and \noblivious. How about giving tax incentives to companies that stay in the \nUS? For the first time in years, jobs are returning from overseas faster \nthan they are leaving. Oh, and for the first time since 2001, the country \ndoesn't have to fear going to war with some country that our president \nhappens to hate. Bush or McCain would probably have had us at war with Iran \nby now. Since you are probably a high school drop out, let me give you a \nquick history lesson, which I'm actually qualified to do. Part of the \nreason the Middle East is so effed up is because Western powers have been \ntooling around there for the last century. After WWI, Britain and France \ndivided up most of the Middle East into their present borders in a secret \nagreement called the Sykes Picot agreement. They failed to consider who \nlived where, which is why you now have Kurds living in five different \ncountries without their own state. It's why you have Sunis and Shias \nfighting. Oh, and did you know that Iran used to be one of our closest \nallies? What changed that you ask? Well, the people of Iran kicked out \ntheir Shah because he was abusive. And the CIA helped reinstall him despite \nthe fact that he was hated. So once Iran got rid of the Shah, they saw the \nUS as an enemy. Did you know we used to support Saddam Hussein in the 80s \nwhen he fought Iran? Did you know that we gave weapons to the Mujahideen \n(\"freedom fighters\") who eventually used those weapons on our own troops in \nAfghanistan?\n\nBottom line is, the US has been screwing the world up for a long time. And \nwe can't afford to keep doing it, fiscally. Obama is the first president in \na long time that respects the national sovereignty of other nations and \nhasn't created millions of additional enemies during his terms. So do some \nthinking, and realize conservatism is outdated and fading.
