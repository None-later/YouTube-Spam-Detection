(such as tattoos, body piercings, clothing and hair \nstyles, artistic expression, music, media, as well as social interactions, \nand whom one chooses to associate with)\nExample 1.) Allowing a woman to wear what she wants in public would be \ndescribed as liberal. Placing rules on what a woman can wear in public \n(within reason, obviously nudity is commonly unacceptable), and having \npolicies requiring a specific state of dress (such as requiring people to \nwear clothing that provides a specified level of coverage), would be \ndescribed as conservative.\nExample 2.) Extending and protecting rights and privileges to people within \na given society who do not share in the most common or popular morals and \nvalues would be described as liberal. Restricting rights and privileges of \npeople within a given society who do not share in the most common or \npopular morals and values would be described as conservative.\nExample 3.) Demonstrating an acceptance towards change and allowing for \ndiffering views, as well as social and cultural differences to co-exist \nwould be described as liberal. Demonstrating resistance to change, and \nrestricting or discouraging differing views, as well as social and cultural \ndifferences and preventing them from co-existing, or simply restriction the \namount of interaction between people who share differing views, values, and \ncultural differences would be described as conservative.\nExample 4.) Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Speech are liberal concepts. \nRestrictions on what religious beliefs may be practiced within a given \nsociety including restrictive provisions on what is allowed in public \nregarding speech and the expression of one's own opinions are conservative \nconcepts.\nThere are numerous examples of Conservative views and values. What one \nculture or society would consider as conservative, another culture or \nsociety would consider normal or even liberal. And what one culture or \nsociety would consider as liberal, another culture or society would \nconsider it as conservative. Thus depending on what sort of society or \nculture you live in is going to determine what you may consider as liberal \nor conservative. I, for example might consider myself to be somewhat \nconservative with moderate leanings. While someone else would see me as \nradically liberal or even extremely leftwing. And yet in another person \nwould see me as radically conservative or even extremely rightwing. It's \nall a matter of perspective.

Take \nfor example Saudi Arabia. Compulsion of religion is explicitly forbidden. \nThere's no interpretation on that.\n\nAs for the argument Islam can be defined as whatever you want isn't true. \nThere's clearly consensus over much of what Islam says after all we we \nwouldn't have 1.5 billion muslims practicing Islam the core tenants of \nIslam.\n\n\"What matters is this: Religion, regardless of the particular \ninterpretation, and regardless of whether or not you agree with the \nparticular interpretation, is overall a force for evil.\"\n\nWell that's your opinion and no matter how assertively you may state it it \ndoesn't make it true.

Islam says there is no compulsion in religion. Yet the \ncorrupt Wahabbi dictators ignore that. That is the greatest piece of \nevidence to show how fundamentally un Islamic Saudi Arabia is.\n\nIt can be summed up by a Muslim traveller who travelled to the West and \nacross the Middle East during the 20th century: \"In the Middle East there \nare Muslims but there is no Islam. In the West there is Islam but there are \nno Muslims\". Basically the laws and the culture and society of the west are \nfundamentally more Islamic than the countries in the Middle East. \n\nYou admit (finally) that religion has been the reason for the progress of \nscience and women's rights. But then you assert religion is mostly anti \nscience and anti progress. Well surely there's some kind of reconciliation \nbetween those two notions because that sounds like contradictions?\n\nTo answer how is it I see religion as a force for good is by looking at \nhuman history where as we both agree it has played a substantially positive \nrole. It's also by reading the teachings of religion that I see a positive \nmessage. One of self discipline, justice, patience, acceptance, ethics, \nconduct etc \n\nNow anti science and women groups may be based on religion. But all that \nmeans is a group of people have formed a group based on THEIR \ninterpretation of their own religion. It doesn't mean the religion itself \nis against science or women's rights. \n\nAnyway it was good talking to you.

Saudi Arabia is one of the most religious nations on the \nplanet. They literally require you to convert to Islam before you become a \ncitizen of their country. If that's not a prime example of an Islamic \ncountry, I don't know what is.\n\nhttp://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/wcm/connect/121c03004d4bb7c98e2cdfbed7ca8368/EN_saudi_nationality_system.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=121c03004d4bb7c98e2cdfbed7ca8368\n\nBut again, I don't know how you can claim religion is a force for good when \nnearly every anti-science and anti-woman movement has been religion-based. \nIt's easy to look at a society which is mostly religious, see that it is \nadvancing women's rights, and attribute that advance to religion. But that \nnecessarily isn't the case.\n\nLook, I'm not arguing religion is entirely anti-science. After all, where \nwould we be if it were not for the Christian-inspired surge of rationality \nduring the Renaissance, or the 900-1200 A.D. Golden Age of Muslim science? \nWhat I *am* arguing, however, is that religion is mostly anti-science, and \nanti-progress in general.\n\nAnd yes, modern conditions do serve as evidence for this. We can clearly \ntrace the history of each country and determine the average level of \nreligiosity over the course of human history. What we find is that there \nexists a large progress gap, both socially and technologically, between \nreligious countries and non-religious countries. You can't simply sweep \nthis under a rug.\n\nFinally, Christianity isn't limited to the teachings of Jesus. The Earth \nbeing created before light, humans living hundreds of years, millions of \nanimals boarding a single ship... I wouldn't exactly call these passages \nscientific, would you? And before you pull the *the old testament doesn't \ncount* argument, remember that the New Testament is merely an extension of \nthe Old Testament. As Jesus himself says, \"do not think that I have come to \nabolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to \nfulfill\" (Matthew 5:17)."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvgBVCyIW4qrUzdl3jFwiA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "shocco", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qtja50n2byh0zr04cdbfzbqm3xxxq4t40k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-15T02:30:32.918Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHvgBVCyIW4qrUzdl3jFwiA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.20391200000000004, "formal_score": 66, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-15T02:30:32.918Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103645661339186567707", "textDisplay": "+glassplotful \"You keep bringing up these instances where the Muslim world \nis fighting for women's rights, as if that is evidence that religion is \npro-women.\" \n\nInstances?

started to occur in and around the 1990s.\n\nThis is when the CIA started actively funding terrorist groups in Pakistan \nand Afghanistan and supplying them with weapons and training. Almost all \nthe 'terrorist' training camps today are run by CIA money in conjunction \nwith Saudi intelligence. They provide the infrastructure for these \nterrorists to breed. Al Qaeda literally means \"the base\" and is derived \nfrom the full name \"the database\" because the CIA made a database of all \nthe terrorist operatives affiliated in Afghanistam/Pakistan.\n\nAs for the Crusades you should know the atrocities committed by Western \nkingdoms were brutal even for it's time. The Western Kingdoms sacked the \ncity of Constanaiople which was a fellow Christian city! Whilst the motives \nfor the Crusades were the immense wealth of the Middle East (Just as Oil is \nthe reason today). The flourishing trade and the gold in Syria and of \ncourse leaders wanting to boost their popularity with a victory abroad.\n\nAnd as for Muslim persecution of Jews and Christians this happened very \nsporadically. It was never systematic unlike persecution in Western \nKingdoms. When the Muslims left Spain the Jews travelled with them because \nthey feared Christian rule worse than Muslim."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXqyWvNQ_adTEvcP5R4stQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "April Lamba", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135wjt4wovogvwip04cdhth0nz1xdwouec", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-19T10:02:50.048Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmXqyWvNQ_adTEvcP5R4stQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.13559000000000004, "formal_score": 55, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-19T10:03:09.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107026936610507542959", "textDisplay": "+shocco Muslim problems with liberty and freedom was there long before the \nwest even thought of going there.

'Most Women who wear a hijab or headscarf do so because of societal \npressures or outright religious law. - They are slaves'.\n\n2. 'Some Women who do choose to wear a hijab clearly aren't thinking \nstraight as they are brainwashed by backwards religious thinking conceived \nby men living in patriarchal 7th century societies to control their lives.'\n\nThese people don't have any data to back up either of these claims nor do \nthey probably have any personal experiences of speaking to Women who choose \nto wear the hijab. Their views of Islam are influenced by the mass media in \na post 9/11 Islamophobic world. Not accidentally; when the US has had an \nenemy the most pervasive form of indoctrination happens through the mass \nmedia. Even the most intelligent people fall to this 'soft war'. First it \nwas Totalitarian Communism and now it's 'Fundamentalist' Islam.\n\nIt is THEIR views on religion has shaped their interpretation on what \nothers choose to do with their lives. In essence they are committing the \nvery errors they claim to be fighting against. Ignorance and Free Will: \n'You don't know what's good for you but I do' is essentially what they're \nsaying to women who choose to wear a hijab. They hold deep seated beliefs \nthat they are some how more enlightened and this is as a direct result of \nthe next fallacy:\n\nPeople have equated the superior standard of living of Western countries \nover others as proof of the apparent superiority of Western morals over \nother morality systems. In their eyes the Middle East is in the trouble \nit's in now because of Islam. It is Islam that is holding Middle East back. \nAnd yet these people don't seem to know for the last 50 years religion has \nplayed a minor role in most Middle Eastern societies as pan Arab \nnationalism - similar to 20th century European nationalism has been the \ndefining character of these countries not religious orthodoxy. There was \nvery few places in the 60s and 70s more liberal today than Cairo. And yet \nEgypt was no better off then than it is today (okay maybe not today).

In the West, women are subject to 'sexual \nobjectification' which means that their sole value comes from their \nsexuality and beauty. You can sugar coat it however you please but this is \na key fact taught in women psychology. Just look at the way the women are \nportrayed in the West. The emphasis on beauty leads to social pressures and \nthis in turn has caused women to acquire eating disorders 9 times more than \nmen due to stress (according to one study).\n\nBesides, it is important to note that Muslim women are choosing to wear the \nhijab out of their own free choice. Why can't people respect their decision?\nIn the West, women can go naked on beaches but that is not oppression. The \nmoment these women decide to cover themselves and guard their modesty, the \ntypical Westerner yells out oppression. If Islam is indeed oppressing \nwomen, then why are the majority of converts (over 2/3) women?\n\nThe truth of the matter is that in the West: Men want the right to look at \nthe bodies of women other than their own spouses and women want the right \nto show off their bodies to men other than their own spouses. And in a \nsociety where men are looking for action and women looking for attention, \nthis breeds major problems. Just look at the divorce rate in the US: 50%. \nClearly, the marriage institution is broken! Fornication and adultery is \nall too common. The typical Westerner is also conveniently tolerant to \npornography wherein women are subject to oppression, aggression, \ndegradation, humiliation, discrimination, and the worst forms of \nexploitation. It is a two-sided coin: on the one side there is lust while \non the other there is misogyny. Did you know that human sex trafficking is \na global network and constitutes a multi-billion dollar business? Recent \nresearch shows that four countries with major commercial sex markets \ninclude Jamaica, the Netherlands, the United States, and Japan. Think \nthat's a coincidence? What do they all have in common? \"Culture of \nTolerance.\"\n\nIslam teaches men to look at the hearts of women and not just their outward \nlooks and appearances and it encourages women to do the same.\nAnd this I believe is one of the many beauties of this major world religion!\nMuslim women are amongst the most pious women in the world and people hate \nout of jealousy and envy. These women are virgins till marriage and guard \ntheir modesty for their husbands and men guard their modesty in kind.\nCompare that to a typical westerner: How many are virgins before marriage?\n\nPlease don't tell me that this has nothing to do with the hijab because the \ntypical Westerner is not merely concerned with Muslim women taking off \ntheir hijabs. They want these women to be \"liberated\" like they see \nthemselves and you know it!\nHere is one of the westerner's most characteristic behavioral patterns: \nthey want to \"free\" these \"oppressed damsels\" from their constrained \nethical and moral values so badly that they are shocked to learn when these \nreligious Muslim women don't share their vainglorious self-opinion. \n\n\"Islam is the only religion that gives both husband and wife a true \nunderstanding of what love is. The Western \"love\" concept, you take it \napart, it really is lust. But love transcends just the physical. Love is \ndisposition, behavior, attitude, thoughts, likes, dislikes - these things \nmake a beautiful woman, a beautiful wife. This is the beauty that never \nfades.

Because my \nReligion asks that of me, and i absolutely love my religion, it's a part of \nmy identity and i am not ashamed of it. Islam has given me so much, Islam \nhas raised the status of females, in fact before Islam came into existence \nwomen were buried, just for being born a girl, babies were buried alive or \nkilled because they shamed their families. So how could you say that it \noppresses us? Why don't people really ask girls why they wear it, not what \ntype they would prefer and wording questions in ways that make them \nautomatically say yes. Islam does not say a women cannot choose to wear \nwhat she wants, it teaches women to make the right choices between wearing \nclothing that cover you up and protect your modesty than clothes that makes \npeople objectify you and literally stare at you as if you were a piece of \nmeat, an animal to ravish. If you ask me, i prefer the first where i know \nif i guy is interested in me, its because of me, my mind, my personality \nand not just how big my chest is or how skinny my stomach is, or how tall i \nlook in heels. \n\nAnd another thing, Islam does not label men \"rapists\" that's not why, \nhumans just have a weakness for beauty and desires, especially the sexual \nkind, so covering up a women prevents the man and women from falling prey \nto their desires and engaging in wrong acts before marriage that lead to \nmany problems like sexual diseases, illegitimate children and just messes \nthings up.

Pray only takes five \nminutes or less...maybe 20mins a day more or less depending on the person. \nYour knees are bad...your allowed to sit. I had friends that were buddhist \nand we respected each other just fine...Buddhism is a huge part of chinese \nmartial arts which I studies for some time, when it was time to pray to \nbuddha and the masters of the system I didn't and they respected that. My \nfavorite teacher was hindu, and high in the caste system...she offered me \none of her daughters for Marriage. Like I said those weren't dumb answers, \nthey play a huge role in deciding if you want to join those religions.

I quoted the bible, there is no \nmention of anything even closely related. It's telling them to hide their \n'goods' which will help them develop strength of personality where they \nwon't have to use their 'goods' like women do nowadays. It's funny because \nwhen I have to 'dress to impress' I usually wear far more than I normally \ndo, but my wife usually wears tight dresses with shorter hemlines, as women \nusually have to do. That is a result of male dominated society. \n\nWe agree that women shouldn't have to see themselves as goods. But you \nthink letting them  'wear what they want,' which you think is wearing less, \nis the solution. That makes no sense to me. My point is that they have the \nfreedom to dress how they like as long as it's within the limits of the \nmodesty standards. And if they choose not to they are not standing on equal \ngrounds as men. \n\nYou misunderstand. It's not an excuse, I would never justify it.

Why is acting provocatively an \nexpression of freedom but behaving modestly is oppression?\n\nYeah well, we disagree on that. i think it's not a good thing. Promiscuity \nis something bad but we've come to accept it. Additionally, sexual feelings \noften lead men to take advantage of or even rape women. I would normally \nsay that they can do what they want, but as a father now I feel sorry for \nothers who can't do anything about how their daughters or sisters etc. \nbehave.

Surprising, only 5% of Americans are atheists, but they are \nvery vocal. And I guess some 30% of Europeans are so that adds to it.

And atheists who have had a bad \nexperience with religious people.

That is not \nreally their choice, and even if it is, it's usually because they are \nbrainwashed to think so. Personally I think the Hijab is fine, it only \nhides your hair and it's pretty much just a religious symbol. I've met a \nlot of confident women who seem to wear hijab of their own choice.\n\nAs I've said, different societies have different modesty standards. In an \nisland like you described, the standards are different. I'm guessing women \nwalking around in bikinis are not uncommon. I don't like that, but I'm not \ngoing to argue against it.\n\nAs you said, men feel no pressure to dress provocatively, yet if a woman \nwants attention she needs to. This is not equality for women. If they want \nto stand on equal footing as men, which they should, they should not have \nto feel this pressure. No doubt, wearing clothes that show off things that \nmen find sexual hurts the gender equality movement.\n\nContrary to the opinion of feminazis, I dont think men and women are \nperfectly equal. In many ways, women are better. Men are more visual \ncreatures, that is how we were made/evolved. And I would say that it is in \nthe nature of many males, unfortunately, to objectify women, particularly \nwomen who are giving a message that they want their attention. It incites \nlust, often from men you don't want. You can blame men for this, like \nfeminists do, but that's not going to change anything.\n\nTo summarize, women should not be discriminated by what they wear, but \ndressing provocatively puts them at more risk and doesn't do favors to \ntheir personality. I think we agree on many points but the conclusion is \ndifferent\n \n\nConservatives love traditions, and liberals usually want to get rid of \nthem. Things kind of suck for conservatives right now, the film industry \nand other mass media are all owned by liberals. My daughter is currently a \nyear old so, thankfully, I'm not too concerned yet, but the antics of \nteenage idols these days makes me terrified.\n\nI'm gonna guess you are not religious, but the funny thing is that religion \nhas almost nothing to do with modesty. The Bible: Timothy 2:9-10. \"I also \nwant women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided \nhair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, \nappropriate for women who profess to worship God.\" That's more of a \nstatement for personality, but modesty is a part of it. Surprisingly the \nQu'ran says the same thing and only adds that women \"should draw their \nveils over their bosoms.\" The Middle East is the way it is mainly because \nof Arab culture and a male dominated society. Socially it's about a hundred \nyears behind but it's getting better."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSlBidn8kzjkdodw-1ByNg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Cory Louis", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13dwrbgulbjsnro304cf3sxxpaovl3p5ps0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-17T00:32:50.063Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoSlBidn8kzjkdodw-1ByNg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.066094000000000042, "formal_score": 24, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-17T00:32:50.063Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UdEKhpKpRgg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACA/GwZRrJjvSME/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111113154081263165161", "textDisplay": "i think that every woman is entitled to her own moral standards, i endorse \nfreedom, what i don't like is discrimination, a person deserves respect \nweather or not you feel their outside appearance is deserving of it \n\nim okay with cultures and tradition, so long as they are not infringing on \nthe free will of these women living in the middle east. personally i am \nmore of a liberal you could say, i believe in freedom and tolerance \n\na woman can wear revealing clothes because she wants to look sexy to \nattract men, when someone wants to do something, they dress for the \noccasion, if she wants to find a boyfriend/girlfriend, she may dress \nslightly more revealing \n\nthe woman may want to embrace her sexual features, men don't feel any \npressure from society to dress less provocatively, this is a cross soley \nput onto the backs of women to bear and you need to understand that it can \nbe hard \nsome women feel happy when they embrace their sexual features and curves, \nthey don't feel like objects at all, on the contrary i think when she has \nto consciously hide away her goods, it may lower her self esteem and she \nmay feel like her body is just a sexual object that needs to be hidden away \nbecause of shame.\n\nweather, sometimes, depending on the country, the weather may be \nunbearable, i live on a tropical island where there is much heat, men \nsimply walk around topless, women should be free to  wear less clothes with \nout feeling like bad people \n\ncreativity, the woman is expressing herself, she is free to explore the \nboundaries of her identity, she doesn't have to look the same as other \nwomen and shouldn't she can wear long sweaters or sleeveless tops or mix it \nup to have a balance of both sexual and modest looks \n\nthese are some reasons why women wear revealing clothes other than to \nattract men and objectify themselves. \n\nin conclusion, i think men and women do have certain social traditions and \nmorals which should be respected, but each individual should be able to \ndecide for themselves which is not always the case in the middle east."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH5N15gMSN3vkrwtZcxBP4g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "John Meyers Howard", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13dwrbgulbjsnro304cf3sxxpaovl3p5ps0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-16T21:18:50.310Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCH5N15gMSN3vkrwtZcxBP4g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29280799999999996, "formal_score": 11, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-16T21:18:50.310Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VVNGqluwQ4A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/zYT_N6ZExPA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104793941808718032638", "textDisplay": "I only really care how well dressed my daughter will be when she's older, \nevery other female can make whatever choice she likes. \n\nEach society has different standards of modesty.In several areas in Africa \nfor example, it is not unusual to see women walking around topless.

Just because something was part of \ntheir culture and they could get away with it doesn't mean it's right \n(which is what moral relativism would argue). It wasn't moral for our \nfounding fathers to own slaves. They would have done just fine, there was \nnever a need. It was never justifiable to own people, and just because \npeople didn't \"think\" of it as immoral (\"ethics\" is the word you're looking \nfor), doesn't mean that it's not a violation of the basic human right to \nliberty. It was a simple case of \"might makes right\", which was codified \nand upheld by the bible. Read up on the universal declaration of human \nrights for a good place to start.\n\n\"No True Scotsman\" fallacy, first off. The point that I'm trying to make in \nregards to the problems that I have with Christianity is this: believe \nwhatever you want, but don't try to make public policy out of your views \nthat are only defensible behind the veil of faith. Here's a list of such \ntopics that come to mind: gay marriage, creationism in school, evolution \ndenialism in school, blue laws, stem cell research. That's just what I can \nname off the top of my head. I don't hate anybody, really.

Most religious women throughout history, Jews included, have \nusually interpreted that as some sort of headgear (even the Virgin Mary). \nBesides there is no universal agreement within the Islamic community as to \nwhat is appropriate.

Massively offensive to \nmen? you must be extremely sensitive or you judge without knowing the \nreligion. and you need to realize that you need to wear a hijab but if you \nwant to further cover yourself up that is your choice between you and your \nLord for how much further you will obey Him even though He doesn't burden \nwomen with it. also when my mother started covering up, she felt so \ncomfortable and so much more free because when you obey Allah, he will take \nall burdens off your back. and then you go ahead to mock it saying its a \nbaseball cap and just laughing, shame on you. HAHA, and you talk about \nfreedom. Dont blame Islam for the wrong doings of Muslims, the religion is \nperfect but its followers are not. some Muslim countries dont allow you to \nnot wear a hijab because Islam needs to be stronger than ever and women \nwithout hijabs will dis encourage them which will make Muslims weaker.

Everyone I know says I write very eloquently.\n\nYour main problem is that you have issues with substance.  You write large \nwalls of text and fail to make any valid points or produce any reasonable \narguments in them.  It's just a bunch of rambling most of the time.  Being \na good writer isn't about word count.  It's about substance.  Don't worry, \nyou just need to keep practicing.\n\nAs for your question.  Social pressures, religious indoctrination and \ntaboos play a huge role in everything.  You can claim that some are wearing \nit by \"choice\", but is it really a choice?  The men of the culture outcast \nor commit violence on the women who don't conform to wearing these outfits \nin many countries.\n\nThe women see this.  They are raised around this.  It becomes the norm. \n They are told their holy book commands it.  They know no different.

However more interestingly they found that \nmost were perpetrated by the poorest sections of society...\n\nSo now we have an economic edge...\n\nAnd a horrific series of murderous events - that are in no way exclusive to \nIslam, but are exclusive to poverty and ignorance. (ignorance being the new \nby-word for religion in general, Islam in particular) \n\n\"Countries where women are beaten or whipped for the \"crime\" of being raped \nor sexually assaulted?\" Yeah no excuse for this - main problem being based \naround the inability to convict offenders of rape a problem all societies \naround the world are having serious trouble with. There are Two notably \ndifferent Islamic hurdles in countries like Saudi-Arabia, where they have a \npresumption of guilt rather than innocence (although I imagine that a much \ncheaper judicial system) and have adopted the bizarre Islamic tradition \nthat a prosecution for rape requires 4 male witnesses...Clearly a case for \nlarge scale judicial reform...\n\nThen annoyingly it goes downhill citing\n\"Countries where women have battery acid thrown in their face if they \nchoose to not wear a black bag over their body or if they try to get an \neducation,\" this has never been a law anywhere and Is purely the strategy \nof mad fringe people...largely in response to the encroachment of western \nideas..which one could conclude is either reactionary or innate to an \nIslamist mindset.\n\nIn 2006, a government poll found that over 80 percent of Saudi women do not \nthink women should drive or should work with men.\nA Gallup poll found that most Saudi women do not think women should be \nallowed to hold political office; However The official law, if not the \ncustom, requiring a guardian's permission for a woman to seek employment \nwas repealed in 2008. So To Try and conclude Civilization will move at its \nown pace - Your moral condemnation of the Hijab is somewhat besides the \npoint...Oppression, repression does occur but Its far more complicated than \nyou can be bothered to portray it...Most Islamic women see the Hijab like \nyou see wearing a crucifix on a necklace... A \"harmless\" religious \nsymbol...Progress will be made but slowly as you cannot forcibly convert \npeople to your way of thinking, without generating resentment.\n\nI do have the feeling that you haven't been reading my posts..."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmDhpDj6Q6TVabYJZnXAeqw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "tetsubo57", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13sefbqdnynyh5zl04cedqgdruljzmqsck", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-14T21:07:59.434Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmDhpDj6Q6TVabYJZnXAeqw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.5201420000000001, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-14T21:07:59.434Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-om75yJ1K0BY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAk/v44o91OveB4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101446087951030396205", "textDisplay": "+erni In the US you *can* wear a Nazi uniform around.

For another \nMuslim or Arab-Muslim male, he might have a different preference from one \nspectrum to the other, and that's completely fine. Now let me get into this \nbullshit commentary expressed by Ana and Cenk.\n\n1) Ana (who's never lived in the Middle East) and Cenk (who's 43 and moved \nfrom Turkey and emigrated to the US when he was 8 years old) make this \nfucking general assumption that women in the Middle East and South Asia \nwear Niqabs, Burqas, or Hijabs because they're impelled to by the male \nmembers in their family. You don't know in actuality the percentage of \nwomen in these societies surveyed, who are made to wear these garments by \ntheir male relatives or husbands. And conversely, you don't the percentage \nof women who voluntarily choose to wear them either for spiritual and pious \nreasons or for personal reasons like confidence or integrity of their hard \nwork, etc. \n\nInstead, they argue THEIR perceptions of why these supposed males in these \nsocieties favor women wearing these clothing items. Totally disregarding \nthe reasoning behind why women in these countries favor wearing them and \neven dismissing why women favor them at all. \n\n2) Even Cenk invokes his own views and opinions on what women ought to wear \nwhen he says, \"(on wearing headdresses) I VOTE NO!\" and \"here's a headdress \nyou should have-nothing.\" Firstly, Cenk, you don't have a vote. Secondly, \nTwo contradictory points arise from this, 1) Why are you opposed to what \nmen in these societies favor, when you're doing the FUCKING EXACT SAME \nTHING. You're invoking your own preferences on what women ought to wear, \nwhich leads to my second point. 2) Why don't you allow the individual women \nin these societies to choose what ever attire is more preferable for them \nto wear instead of imposing your views and insinuating that each one, or \neven the majority of them are made to wear them by the males in their \nfamily? Which means that if they personally prefer to wear a Hijab, Niqab \nor even a Burqa on their own volition, then that's wholly acceptable and \nappropriate for them to do so.\n\nA real man would've stated, \"whatever action makes you more comfortable \ndisregarding all of the pressure from family and society, I encourage and \nbless you in taking that action (including if she prefers to wear the \nHijab, the Niqab or even the Burqa).\n\n3) Ana (having no expertise in Islam or Middle Eastern or Muslim societies) \ncontinues pushing her own personal assumptions and perceptions about why \nwomen wear headdresses, says, \"no one's going to point to you on the street \nand say 'you're not wearing a baseball cap, what's wrong with you!'\" You \nsee? This is part of the problem. Had Ana been well-versed about what I \nmentioned above (Islam, Middle Eastern and/or Muslim societies), she \nwould've been aware that that's EXACTLY what they've done in countries and \nsocieties in Europe and even Africa-with other countries like Canada and \nAustralia, among others, either considering legislation or debating the \nissue. And in other countries you have governments in these societies \n(here's a shocker, predominantly led by and legislated by men), in addition \nto westerners living in these countries claiming to be in favor of \n\"freedom\" and \"liberty,\" then passing and enacting laws banning (making it \nillegal) and/or restricting the rights of women in these countries and \nsocieties to wear them.\n\nAnd finally,\n\n4) Ana and Cenk make Western-centered, Eurocentric, statements like,  \"I'm \nso embarrassed,\" \"it's hard not to get discouraged,\" \"(wearing the Burqa \nand Niqab) are horribly insulting to women,\" and my favorite (sarcasm), \"if \nthat's your culture, then your culture is wrong\" and all throughout the \nvideo, he and Ana make highly defamatory, insulting and offensive remarks \nregarding the people of these countries and societies. These \nwestern-centered and Eurocentric views are exactly the sentiments that led \nto Eurocentrism and Orientalism that allowed Europeans to view themselves \nand their culture as superior to that of the people's in the Middle East \nand North Africa, promoting their despicable notions of colonizing the \npeople of these regions, dominating their political, social and economic \nlives, as though they needed to be guided like children. It was dangerous, \nvile, and evil then, and it's dangerous, vile and evil now. To this day, \nyou have westerners in influential positions of western society, including \nmedia and among the western population, expressing and invoking these \nIslamophobic, racist, bigoted, discriminatory, hateful and evil sentiments, \neven when it regards to the livelihoods of the people of these regions, \nincluding death, injury and harm.\n\nI vehemently oppose your views and sentiments. I found them abhorrent, \nobjectionable and as stated previously, dangerous. I began watching this \nvideo thinking it was going to be more light-hearted and a little less \npartial, not expecting all of the deplorable things done and said in this \nvideo. If you want to focus on women's rights, then focus on human rights, \nbecause women's rights ARE human rights. And if you're going to concentrate \non human rights in these regions then you've got to mention what these \nwestern societies have done in these regions, from the murders (by bullet, \nbombs, etc.), maiming/injuries, exploitation, extortion, expulsion, \nsubjugation, harassment, etc., that they've committed, to the sexual \nmolestation/sexual assaults and rapes of women and girls and men in these \ncountries and societies by westerners and their terrorist \"armies.\" Cenk \nand Ana are clearly entitled to their own views, but ultimately I don't \nagree with them for the reasons stated above.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12wiry55zf2tzdfw22qf1qojuvnftg4o04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 34, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl":

The victors were the Christian \nStates, the old Habsburg and Romanov Empires and the new nation-states of \nGreece, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.[55] Rival European powers encouraged \nthe development of nationalist ideologies among the Ottoman subjects in \nwhich the Muslims were portrayed as an ethnic \u201cfifth column\u201d leftover from \na previous era that could not be integrated into the planned future states. \nThe struggle to rid themselves of Ottomans became an important element of \nthe self-identification of the Balkan Christians.[56]\n\nAccording to Mark Levene, the Victorian public in the 1870s paid much more \nattention to the massacres and expulsions of Christians than to massacres \nand expulsions of Muslims, even if on a greater scale. He further suggests \nthat such massacres were even favored by some circles. Mark Levene also \nargues that the dominant powers, by supporting \"nation-statism\" at the \nCongress of Berlin, legitimized \"the primary instrument of Balkan \nnation-building\": ethnic cleansing.[57] Hall points out that atrocities \nwere committed by all sides during the Balkan conflicts. Deliberate terror \nwas designed to instigate population movements out of particular \nterritories. The aim of targeting the civilian population was to carve \nethnically homogeneous countries.[58]\n\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War of 1787\u20131792 the Russian Army commander \nAlexander Suvorov successfully besieged the fortress of Izmail on December \n22, 1790. Ottoman forces inside the fortress had the orders to stand their \nground to the end, haughtily declining the Russian ultimatum. Alexander \nSuvorov announced the capture of Ismail in 1791 to the Tsarina Catherine in \na doggerel couplet, after the assault had been pressed from house to house, \nroom to room, and nearly every Muslim man, woman, and child in the city had \nbeen killed in three days of uncontrolled massacre, 40,000 Turks dead, a \nfew hundred taken into captivity. For all his bluffness, Suvorov later told \nan English traveller that when the massacre was over he went back to his \ntent and wept.[59]\n\nJustin McCarty estimates that between 1821 and 1922 around five and a half \nmillion Muslims were driven out of Europe and five million more were killed \nor died of disease and starvation while fleeing.[60] Cleansing occurred as \na result of the Serbian and Greek independence in the 1820s and 1830s, the \nRusso-Turkish War 1877\u20131878, and culminating in the Balkan Wars 1912\u20131913. \nMann describes these acts as \u201cmurderous ethnic cleansing on stupendous \nscale not previously seen in Europe\u201d referring to the 1914 Carnegie \nEndowment report.[61][62] It is estimated that at the turn of the 20th \ncentury there were 4,4 million Muslims living in the Balkan zone of Ottoman \ncontrol.[63] More than one million Muslims left the Balkans in the last \nthree decades of the 19th century.[64] Between 1912 and 1926 nearly 2.9 \nmillion Muslims were either killed or forced to emigrate to Turkey.[63]\n\nBetween 10,000[65] and 30,000[66][67][68] Turks were killed in Tripolitsa \nby Greek rebels in the summer of 1821, including the entire Jewish \npopulation of the city. Similar events as these occurred also elsewhere \nduring the Greek Revolution resulting in the eradication and expulsion of \nvirtually the entire Turkish population of the Morea. These acts ensured \nthe ethnic homogenization of the area under the rule of the future modern \nGreek state.[69] In 1830 the Muslims population in Morea is put at 300,000. \nIn 1878 the Muslim inhabitants in Thessaly are estimated to be 150,000 and \nin 1897 the Muslims numbered 50,000 in Crete. By 1919 there were virtually \nno Muslims left in Morea and Thessaly and only 20,000 in Crete.[70]\n\nIn the Bulgarian insurgency of the April Uprising in 1876 an estimate of \n1,000 Muslims were killed.[71][72] During the Russo-Turkish War a \nsignificant number of Turks were either killed, perished or became \nrefugees. There are different estimates about the casualties of the war. \nCrampton describes an exodus of 130,000-150,000 expelled of which \napproximately half returned for an intermediary period encouraged by the \nCongress of Berlin. Hupchick and McCarthy point out that 260,000 perished \nand 500,000 became refugees.[73][74] The Turkish scholars Karpat and Ipek \nargue that up to 300,000 were killed and 1\u20131.5 million were forced to \nemigrate.[75][76] Members of the European press who covered the war in \nBulgaria reported on the Russian atrocities against Muslims. Witness \naccounts from Schumla and Razgrad describe children, women and elderly \nwounded by sabres and lances. They stated that the entire Muslim population \nof many villages had been massacred.[77] Recently uncovered photographs in \nthe archive of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the \nRusso-Turkish War 1877\u20131878 show the massacre of Muslims by the Russians in \nthe region of Stara Zagora claiming to have affected some 20,000 Muslim \ncivilians.[78]\n\nMassacres against Turks and Muslims during the Balkan Wars in the hands of \nBulgarians, Greeks and Armenians are described in detail in the 1912 \nCarnegie Endowment report.[79] The Bulgarian violence during the Balkan War \nincluded burning of villages, transforming mosques into churches, rape of \nwomen and mutilation of bodies. It is estimated that 220,000 Pomaks were \nforcefully Christianized and forbidden to bear Islamic religious clothing"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqI5uQh5zMlWjC8vX0jiyzQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Salafi Bowhunter", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12wiry55zf2tzdfw22qf1qojuvnftg4o04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-02T20:51:15.903Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqI5uQh5zMlWjC8vX0jiyzQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.42249200000000003, "formal_score": 91, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-02T20:51:15.903Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y2ZpgfDzzC0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHM/u3_Tgk7q5j4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101940276929291259567", "textDisplay": "The Lipka Tatars, also known as Polish Tatars or Lithuanian Tatars, were a \ncommunity of Tatar Muslims who migrated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania \nand became Polonized\n\nThe Counter-Reformation of the Catholic Church in the Grand Duchy led to \npersecution of Muslims, Jews, and Orthodox Christians, among the measures \ntaken were banning the repair of old Mosques and preventing new ones from \nbeing constructed, banning serfdom of Christians under Muslims, banning \nmarriage of Christian females to Muslims, putting limitations on property \nownership among Tatars and the Ottoman-Polish conflict fed into the \ndiscriminatory atmosphere against them and led to anti-Islamic writings and \nattacks.[38]"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqI5uQh5zMlWjC8vX0jiyzQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Salafi Bowhunter", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12wiry55zf2tzdfw22qf1qojuvnftg4o04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-02T20:50:47.226Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqI5uQh5zMlWjC8vX0jiyzQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.202264, "formal_score": 39, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-02T20:50:47.226Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y2ZpgfDzzC0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHM/u3_Tgk7q5j4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101940276929291259567", "textDisplay": "Arabs relying largely on Berbers conquered the Iberian Peninsula starting \nin 711, subduing the whole Visigothic Kingdom by 725. The triumphant \nUmayyads got conditional capitulations probably in most of the towns, so \nthat they could get a compromise with the native population. This was not \nalways so. For example, M\u00e9rida, Cordova, Toledo, or Narbonne were conquered \nby storm or after laying siege on them. The arrangement reached with the \nlocals was based on respecting the laws and traditions used in each place, \nso that the Goths (a legal concept, not an ethnic one, i.e. the communities \nruled by the Forum Iudicum) continued to be ruled on new conditions by \ntheir own tribunals and laws.[28] The Gothic Church remained in place and \ncollaborated with the new masters. Al-Andalus or Muslim ruled Iberian \npeninsula, was conquered by northern Christian kingdoms in 1492, as a \nresult of their expansion taking place especially after the definite \ncollapse of the Caliphate of Cordova in 1031.\n\nThe coming of the Crusades (starting with the massacre of Barbastro) and \nsimilarly entrenched positions on the northern African Almoravids, who took \nover al-Andalus as of 1086, added to the difficult coexistence between \ncommunities, including Muslims in Christian ruled territory, or the \nMozarabic rite Christians (quite different from those of the northern \nkingdoms), and further minority groups. The Almohads, a fanatic north \nAfrican sect, pushed the boundaries of religious intolerance during their \noccupation of al-Andalus, affecting also the Jews.[29]\n\nDuring the expansion south of the northern Christian kingdoms, depending on \nthe local capitulations, local Muslims were allowed to remain (Mud\u00e9jars) \nwith some restrictions, while some were assimilated into the Christian \nfaith. After the conquest of Granada, all the Spanish Muslims were under \nChristian rule. The new acquired population spoke Arabic or Mozarabic, and \nthe campaigns to convert them were unsuccessful. Legislation was gradually \nintroduced to remove Islam, culminating with the Muslims being forced to \nconvert to Catholicism by the Spanish Inquisition. They were known as \nMoriscos and considered New Christians. Further laws were introduced, as on \n25 May 1566, stipulating that they 'had to abandon the use of Arabic, \nchange their costumes, that their doors must remain open every Friday, and \nother feast days, and that their baths, public and private, to be torn \ndown.'[30] The reason doors were to be left open so as to determine whether \nthey secretly observed any Islamic festivals.[31] King Philip II of Spain \nordered the destruction of all public baths on the grounds of them being \nrelics of infidelity, notorious for their use by Muslims performing their \npurification rites.[32][33] The possession of books or papers in Arabic was \nnear concrete proof of disobedience with severe repercussions.[34] On 1 \nJanuary 1568, Christian priests were ordered to take all Morisco children \nbetween the ages of three and fifteen, and place them in schools, where \nthey should learn Castillian and Christian doctrine.[35] All these laws and \nmeasures required force to be implemented, and from much earlier.\n\nBetween 1609 and 1614 the Moriscos were expelled from Spain.[36] They were \nto depart 'under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or \nsentence... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels or bills of \nexchange... just what they could carry.'[37]"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqI5uQh5zMlWjC8vX0jiyzQ",

Where is the \nevidence that \"God\" has ever been on earth and talked with someone? It \nhasn\u00b4t been proved. How do we know that Mohammed saw and heard what it saw \nand heard? How do we know that Jesus did what the bible says he did, if \nwhat he did goes completely against the laws of physics? Aren\u00b4t there other \nplausible explanations? Why should we believe in things that go against the \nlaws of the universe? Why would God do things that go against the laws that \nhe supposedly created? Where is the evidence that Adam and Eve existed? \nThere is evidence that the earth is 4560 million years old, thousands of \nfossils of animals that existed 540 million years ago, and evidence of \narcaic hominids (australopithecus) half human half chimpanzees who lived \n4,3 million years ago. \nDo you believe in those things because it\u00b4s a choice or just because if you \ndon\u00b4t do it your family will stop talking to you? or because you won\u00b4t find \na boyfriend? or because you will be rejected from your islamic friends? Is \nit then a true choice? a free one?\nWhen I was a child, I was taught that we came from Adam and Eve, since I \ncome from a very traditional Catholic background. When I was 7 years old I \nfound much more plausible the idea of Darwinism, and tried to find which of \nthe theories had more evidence. \nI tried to \"talk\" to God, because I was told to, but nobody literally \nanswered. Maybe i could imagine that he or she anwered in my head, but no \nreal voice was ever heard (that could be saved in a radiocassette, I mean). \nWhy should God talk to humans, or have a preference to humans? Why not to \nthe other animals? we all come from the same common ancestor. Why not \nbenefit bacteria? I think there are a lot of questions that need to be \nscrutinized and we need answers that are true, that is, that need more \nevidence support. They also need to be able to be repeated and give the \nsame outcome over and over. Religions, like homeopathy, acupuncture, tarot, \nthe ness monster, are just beliefs that do not have evidence, consistency, \nreproducibility and plausability.

As nothing is further from the truth.\n\nSecondly in reference to Hooter's I would just like to say one or two \nthings First No woman is FORCED to work at Hooters. Those that do can leave \nat anytime. Further, produce ONE CASE where a woman was forced to work at \nhooters and was killed because of her refusal. See the difference ?

Secondly, Do you realize Sudan has been in \na civil war that lasted for 22 years. the longest civil war in history. Now \nthat we got that out of the way, another thing you should know is even if \nSudan was a stable country. They have a right to have their own laws that \ncompliment their own culture. Just like how in France women are not allowed \nto wear hijab or niqab or In Belgium girls are not allowed to wear long \nskirts btw these are western countries. Also did you know women in the west \nwere considered a second class citizens. Did you also know in the United \nStates women were allowed to work just to keep the productivity and income \nfor corporations higher and not because they had a right to work. In the \nwest women are used as a tool to make money mostly by corporations while \nthey are still given an illusion or choice. This is also called \nobjectifying women i'm sure you know about that. If you know a simple \npsychology you will know why there are ads of half naked women everywhere. \nThere is a corporation company in North America called Hooters it is a \nrestaurant/bar. In a order for girls/women to work at hooters they must \ndress like strippers almost if they don't they can't work there. I happened \nto watch a documentary about this company and the reason they have those \nwomen dressing that way to attract more customers. They pay them minimum \nwhich is really bad, that way they can depend on the tips which come from \nthe creepy guys that go to hooters. In the documentary they interviewed the \ngirls too most of them don't want to do it but the tips are good which \nallow them to survive. Do you see how trapped these women are? Yes they \nhave a choice to work somewhere but they won't because they can earn that \nextra money on tips working at hooters even though they are being used for \ntheir bodies. That is just one example, point is unless we honestly treat \nwomen fairly and equally we have no right to be pointing fingers. I know \nyou are going to deny it anyway but it is the truth. Last thing, no \nreligion is forcing anyone to do anything, I'm talking about all religions \nthey are there for guidance.

But all of them have to do with \ndisplay to other humans of representing an internal mind state.\n\nIt's a rather nice analogy that babies are born naked, but with the hunger \nto absorb the surrounding culture. Similarly they are born atheist, but \nready to have their minds occupied by the local theistic meme.\n\nHowever, as fellow members of society, we all have a right to see the faces \nof other humans we are interacting with. This is also for very good \nbiological reasons, and I assert this trumps special pleading by the \nreligious.\n\nSo please don't be hard on the women wearing these symbols of oppression. \nSlaves only notice their chains when they try to move.\n\nBTW costumes like men's business suits are also signs of social \nconditioning, just to be clear on that.

For example, the person who was involved the most in bringing Expo \n2020 to the UAE as well as being the main spokesperson is a woman. She \nwears the hijab. Lubna Olayan from Saudi Arabia is a millionaire who works \nin banking and finance. She wears the hijab. Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi, the \ncurrent Minister of Foreign Trade in the UAE. She wears the hijab. Raja \nEasa Al Gurg, she's the president of a well known construction industry in \nDubai. She wears the hijab. Hayat Sindi, a well known medical researcher. \nShe wears the hijab. Maha Al Ghunaim, co-founder and chairperson of one of \nthe region\u2019s largest investment companies, Kuwait\u2019s Global Investment \nHouse. She wears the hijab. I could go on with this list all day long.\n\nMy point is this, the hijab does not empower women. It humbles women. It \nhumbles all Muslims, men and women alike. The Prophet Muhammed said: \"God \nhas revealed to me that you must be humble, so that no one oppresses \nanother and boasts over another.\" Another quote from the Prophet Muhammed: \n\"The most perfect of the believers in faith are the best of them in moral \nexcellence, and the best of you are the kindest to their wives.\" Another \nquote from the Prophet Muhammed: \"None but a noble man treats women in an \nhonorable manner, and none but an ignoble treats women disgracefully.\" \nAnother quote (probably the most fitting for this conversation) from the \nProphet Muhammed: \"Seeking knowledge is a religious obligation for every \nMuslim male or female.\"\n\nSo tell me again. How is the hijab empowering women? Because I don't get it.\n\nJust because 'some' people abuse it, doesn't represent us all. Whether it's \nin religion or anything else in life.

But you can't force them to hide their natural \nproperties that make them attractive. The other side, some women say they \nshould be able to walk around showing their entire belly and backside and \nwear underwear length short shorts, and NOT get called a slut. Then there's \ncases where the girls are younger than 14 (yes even elementary) and wear \ncrop tops and short shorts and they expect to be able to dress like that \nwithout any judgement and be equal to the other girls wearing pony \nt-shirts. The main reason for these differences are the ideas they are \nraised on. One is the importance of religion and strict rules, the other is \npretty princess stories where they have been raised to want to look pretty \nand attract their prince charming since they were born. My solution is \ngetting rid of all this brain washing stuff at childhood and letting the \nthem grow without judgement on looks like boys who get judged how many cool \ntoys or pokemon cards they have then grow into materialistic suckers. My \nopinion though is people in general who dress inappropriately, yes men too \nlike people who choose bright clashing colors to make your eyes bleed for \ntheir ego, should be frowned upon but not to the point you want to hang \nthem or be mean to them.

As for the scientific 'errors' what are they? \nWhen I type in what you told me to type in I get a Wiki Islam providing \nmany examples:\n\n1st Example:\n\n\"And the Sun runs his course for a period determined for him: that is the \ndecree of (Him) the Exalted in Might, the All-Knowing.\"\n\nWhere is the error? That the sun rises for a certain period and then sets \nafterwards? It's describing sunrise and sunset.\n\n2nd Example:\n\n\"It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip \nthe day. They float in an orbit.\"\n\nWow when was the term orbit first used? Galileo in the 14th century? And \nyet here's the Quran 7 centuries earlier describing how the planets move \naround each other.\n\nYet from these two verses wiki islam says:\n\n\"The Qur'an mentions numerous times that the sun and the moon travel in an \norbit, but does not mention once that the earth does too.\" \n\nAnd from that they deduce:\n\n\"This is consistent with a earth-centered (geocentric) view of the cosmos \nthat places a motionless earth at the center of the universe and all \n\"heavenly bodies\" travel around the earth. This was the prevailing \nunderstanding of the universe prior to the 16th century when Copernicus \nhelped explain and popularize a sun-centered (heliocentric) view of the \nuniverse.\"\n\nDo you see how from the exclusion of the orbit of the earth they have \ndeduced the Quran supports the Earth at the centre of the universe \nhypothesis when that's not what the Quran stated? Where in the above two \nverses can you see the Quran say the Earth is the centre of the universe?\n\n3rd Example: Verily! Allah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they move \naway from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, \nthere is not one that could grasp them after Him. Truly, He is Ever Most \nForbearing, Oft Forgiving.\"\n\nWhen I click the link Wiki Islam provides i get a different translation to \nthe one they cite:\n\n\"It is Allah Who sustains the heavens and the earth, lest they cease (to \nfunction): and if they should fail, there is none - not one - can sustain \nthem thereafter: Verily He is Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.\" \n\nSo they've misquoted a verse to suit their argument!\n\nFrom this misquotation Wiki Islam say:\n\n\"The author of the Qur'an emphasises that the earth is fixed in place and \nmotionless. He is clearly unaware that the earth is not only revolving \naround the sun, but also spinning on its own axis.\"\n\nExcept the verse clearly refers to the heavens AND the Earth. So the verse \ncannot refer to a motionless Earth as it makes reference to heaven too. God \nis telling us something else. That the heavens and the Earth could not be \nmoved from their places by another. It is a verse that clearly is \ndisplaying the power of God not any statements referring to astronomy.\n\nIn the next verse we see a deliberate misquoting and changing of words.\n\nThis is what wiki Islam has posted:\n\n\"It is God who made for you the earth a fixed place and heaven for an \nedifice; And He shaped you, and shaped you well, and provided you with the \ngood things. That then is God, your Lord, so blessed be God, the Lord of \nall Being.\"\n\nSo when I click on the link Wiki Islam provides for the verse assuming I'm \ngoing to get the same translation this is what I get instead:\n\n\"It is Allah Who has made for you the earth as a resting place, and the sky \nas a canopy, and has given you shape- and made your shapes beautiful,- and \nhas provided for you Sustenance, of things pure and good;- such is Allah \nyour Lord. So Glory to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!\" \n\nThe translation offered by 4 different scholars all use the words ''resting \nplace''. Wiki cites these translations but changes the words of 'resting \nplace' to 'fixed place' on the page instead and then deduces from that the \nQuran is saying the Earth is motionless. There is a big difference between \n'resting place' and 'fixed place'. Clearly the verse is stating God created \nthe Earth as a home for humanity and all the features it contains. So Wiki \nIslam has deliberately misquoted a verse to suit it's authors \narguments. It's just wrong and it's a really dirty tactic. What does this \nsay about websites like these purporting to examine the Quran?\n\nUltimately I could go through the whole page and dissect the BS 'Errors' \none by one and what I'll find is further misquoting, changing of words and \nfalse deductions but it just goes to show what 5 mins and a bit of critical \nthinking can do.\n\nYou don't believe in the Quran you say a lot of bad things about it. That's \nyour opinion. I don't agree. You say it's backwards despite propagating \nscientific truths that were only proven hundreds of years later: 'All life \ncoming from Water, 'Planets moving in orbit' etc. That's not backwards to \nme.\n\nThe problem Islam has right now is not any message of the Quran or religion \nitself it's the state of the Middle East. Unfortunately the ME is no beacon \nfor humanity and when the ME consists of 26 Muslim majority countries it's \neasy to deduce from that Islam is the problem when various factors are the \nreason mainly the effects of decolonisation, endless western intervention \nand corrupt leaders. Of course the xenophobic media doesn't help and sites \nlike Wiki Islam too.\n\nBut I don't think there's any point me saying any of this. You've closed \nyour heart and you've closed your mind. You want to believe what you want \nto believe. This unfortunately is all pre ordained in the Quran. I don't \ndislike you but next time please show some respect when criticising \nsomething others hold dearly to them.

It's a joke site. It's not a serious critique of the \nQuran it's just mockery. Why don't you read the Quran yourself? (Salih \ninternational translation of course) and come to your own conclusions about \nthe verses?\n\nTo show how mistranslated and decontextualised the verses in the second \nsite you posted are:\n\nYou cannot read verse 2:223 by itself. It doesn't make sense without verse \n2:222 and 2:224. You see the Quran is a [b] narrative [/b]. To get the \ncomplete message you must read at the very least whole sections \ntogether. For example the verses 2:223-2:237 establishes the conduct of \nmarried couples and the treatment of a husband to his wife and a wife to \nher husband.  But in any case I'll show you how flawed the 'translations' \nare.\n\nLets take the ''translation'' in the infidelsare coolsite and compare it to \nSalih International translation:\n\n2:223: \"Your women are your fields, so go into your fields whichever way \nyou like . . . . \"(MAS Abdel Haleem, The Qur\u2019an, Oxford UP, 2004)\n\nWith the full verse in Salih international:\n\n2:223: \"Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you, so come to your \nplace of cultivation however you wish and put forth [righteousness] for \nyourselves. And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him. And give good \ntidings to the believers.\"\n\nSee the difference in translation? And notice the how by removing the 'good \nparts' at the end it casts the message sound in bad light.\n\n2:228 is where it gets interesting\n\nInfidel site:\n\n\". . . Wives have the same rights as the husbands have on them in \naccordance with the generally known principles. Of course, men are a degree \nabove them in status . . .\"\n\nActual translation:\n\n\"Divorced women remain in waiting for three periods, and it is not lawful \nfor them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe \nin Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have more right to take them \nback in this [period] if they want reconciliation. And due to the wives is \nsimilar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But \nthe men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And \nAllah is Exalted in Might and Wise.\" \n\nNotice how the key bit of information: A divorced woman expecting a child \nis left out. And notice how 'degree over them' has been used to assert that \nthe Quran pertains the notion men are a higher level than women but when \nthe rest of the verse is intact you can clearly see 'degree over them' \nmakes sense when taking into account the rest of the passage (conveniently \nignored by I.A.C) referring to the responsibility of a man over a recently \ndivorced woman expecting a child.\n\nIn essence what this verse is saying is a recently divorced man has more \nright to be taken back by a woman if she is expecting a child than if she \nwere not. And that the man has a responsibility over a woman because she is \npregnant and he is the father.\n\nI'll here add verse 2:230 since it's the same passage but 2:230 cannot be \nread by itself it is a continuation of 2:229 and 2:230-31 are completions \nof the passage so I have to post it all:\n\nInfidel site:\n\n2:230: \"And if the husband divorces his wife (for the third time), she \nshall not remain his lawful wife after this (absolute) divorce, unless she \nmarries another husband and the second husband divorces her. [In that case] \nthere is no harm if they [the first couple] remarry . . . .\"\n\nActual Translation:\n\n2:229: \"Divorce is twice. Then, either keep [her] in an acceptable manner \nor release [her] with good treatment. And it is not lawful for you to take \nanything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be \nable to keep [within] the limits of Allah. But if you fear that they will \nnot keep [within] the limits of Allah, then there is no blame upon either \nof them concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the limits \nof Allah ,so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of \nAllah - it is those who are the wrongdoers.\"\n\n2:230: And if he has divorced her [for the third time], then she is not \nlawful to him afterward until [after] she marries a husband other than him. \nAnd if the latter husband divorces her [or dies], there is no blame upon \nthe woman and her former husband for returning to each other if they think \nthat they can keep [within] the limits of Allah. These are the limits of \nAllah, which He makes clear to a people who know.\n\n2:231: And when you divorce women and they have [nearly] fulfilled their \nterm, either retain them according to acceptable terms or release them \naccording to acceptable terms, and do not keep them, intending harm, to \ntransgress [against them]. And whoever does that has certainly wronged \nhimself. And do not take the verses of Allah in jest. And remember the \nfavour of Allah upon you and what has been revealed to you of the Book and \nwisdom by which He instructs you. And fear Allah and know that Allah is \nKnowing of all things.\n\nNow read the verses I just posted. What does it seem like the Quran is \nsaying to you about divorce? If a man divorces a woman and remarry three \ntimes then in order for them to remarry for a fourth time the woman must \nremarry someone else first. Why? Because she is not permitted to HIM. It's \nhis punishment for divorcing a woman twice. In other words his punishment \nfor not making the marriage work. But if she marries someone else and that \nnew husband dies they are permitted to return to each other without blame.\n\nDo you see now why you cannot simply pluck verses out of the Quran. The \nQuran consists of passages that relate to a topic. You must read the whole \npassage which may include multiple verses back to back to get the whole \nmessage.\n\nThe sites you posted do the opposite. They don't evaluate the whole \npassages and they deliberately remove sections from the verses to change \nthe nature of the message as well as mistranslating the verses entirely. \n\nI could go through the rest but this post would be too long. Like I said if \nyou really wanted to know the true message of the Quran read it yourself. \nIt's free but it seems to me you have an ideological bias that is heavily \nslanted in favour of finding something nasty about Islam and this impacts \nnot only your research methods but also the conclusions you come to about \nIslam.\n\nAn open mind is indeed a rarity."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnzdkb0Udj8Z7EP7BsQ-w8Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Platymus", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12mhdnjmtrudxcsq22dwfxifuyif3t2t", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-15T11:41:26.894Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnzdkb0Udj8Z7EP7BsQ-w8Q"}, "sentiment_score": 0.5823799999999999, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-15T11:41:26.894Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103065027588342309506", "textDisplay": "+Ahmed Mohamed\nI'm sorry.

that i don't know, and \nthat's what should teach us modesty."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCj6WZsb0-ySoRkdmsei74g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0,

"+gojewla   We don't just tell you : have faith in god because he does \nexist, no.\n   There is strong evidence and signs of his existence, when you wake up \nthe morning and find a car parked besides your house you won't say: there \nwas a set of chemical and physical factors that made up this car and \nperhaps it was brought here by a wind or a flood (which you didn't see) you \nwill realize that this event was impossible whithout the intervention of \nphysicists,chemists,engeneers,drivers...etc, and when archeologists \ndiscover a hole antique city with stone buildings they would not say wind \nand rain built it, they would rather condlude there was a civilization \nthere.\nTherefor our existence, our universe, our life ...etc imply there is a \ncreator, so you do realize that your analogy with fairies is mistaken.\n   Religion shouldn't scare you or make your life so hard and pathetic like \nit is shown to do, many people do choose atheism because religion restrict \ntheir acts and dosen't allow them to steele, cheat, have extra-conjugal sex \n....etc, so they prefer to live the total freedom and just \"be theirselves\" \n(the typical justiification) and this is what i meaned by the desires, also \nworshiping god is the furthest from selfishness because it is not only the \nprayer,but it is rather a lifestyle that teaches you how to be with people \nand with your self and god and yes you worship god to avoid punishement and \nto obtain god's mercy and this is not selfish at all because everyone is \nresponsible on himself and can't guide all people.\n    By personal experiences i meaned some people chose atheism as a \nreaction to certain bad religious people or very tough restrictions, you \nwill not realize the existence of god just by looking in the air that's \nobvious, otherwise i will not cite the above arguments, talking about \ncontradictions there is no contradiction in our islamic faith and that's \nwhy i defend it.\n   Always saying \"i don't care\" is easy, but it doesn't solve the problem, \nyou just do as your mind dictates (of course in the very limited capacities \nfield you have), have your days out, then you will face the truth ....think \nabout it.\n  "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvHA05YJugNPENUOO0Fn89Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "gojewla",

Please keep in mind, I could go on and on about why \nit's ridiculous to believe in fairies and stuff if you really want me to.\n\nYes, atheists are rebelling against religion because it's constantly shoved \ndown our throats (propaganda and brainwashing that has been going on for \ncenturies, etc.) and we are sick of being told what to believe or worse yet \n- punished for not believing.\n\nRebellion to achieve our desires? Think about that for a second. That \ndoesn't make any sense. We would have to believe in all the religious \npropaganda in the first place in order to rebel against it.

That's why I'm an \natheist. I had personal experiences, such as looking at thin air and not \nseeing anything there. Besides that (and I can only speak personally from \nmy christian background) I have noticed all the inconsistencies, paradoxes \nand contradictions in the religious text, which nowadays people decide to \npick and choose what to take seriously.

Most of \nmy family including my wife and mother do not wear a hijab or head dress \nbut still dress modestly. We have many family friends that wear hijabs \nbecause they choose to and it is their right. Speaking on behalf of islam, \na hijab or burkha is a means of conservativeness. Islam tells women to \ncover themselves to keep themselves modest. Many cultures have variating \nscales of modesty. Islam is at the top in what they consider modest \nwhereas, others may think that much less clothing is still modest. We do \nnot pressure women into wearing a hijab, they do it because it is their \nbelief and their right. They are not forced. My family actually chooses not \nto but still pray and fast for ramadan. Much like women might choose to \nwear make-up. Some might be pressured by society but most women do it \nbecause they want to. Personally, I do not judge for what others believe in \nbased on religion or otherwise. I believe everybody has a right to live \ntheir life how they want. I do not agree with Cenk but it is him who \nchooses what he believes in much as I choose what I believe. Of course \neverybody must be guided by rules but it is difficult to say where to draw \nthe line since everybody has different opinions on morality. This isn't a \nquestion on a woman's right but rights in general. Muslims living in the \nmiddle east may believe that all women should wear a hijab and want to \npressure white powers to do so. If the middle east was a larger power then \nthe white countries would be defending itself instead of attacking. A lot \nof white, male, christians or atheists believe that they are feminists yet \naccuse women of not being able to stand up for themselves. White dominating \ncountries are rather uncultured and believe a lot of lies about islam. Not \ntrying to start a fight, I respect christians but in percentage and in \nnumbers, more terrorists are christian and much more are athiests. The \nproblem is people saying \"muslim women shouldn't wear a hijab because it is \ntheir right.\" The statement contradicts itself. If it is their right you \ncant tell them to or not to wear it. I am not pressuring people to or not \nto wear a hijab, or telling others they shouldn't have an opinion.

But again \nits not my choice to tell a women what to do. The head scarf is her choice. \nCenk said the same thing. \n\nBut Saudi Arabia especially makes women cover up regardless if your Muslim \nor not. This is a form of telling women what to do because they do believe \nthat Men will get aroused seeing a women, hence its the womens job to cover \nup and not the mans job to avert his eyes. \n\nThe superiority comes with the playing field. Again why is it in many \nMuslim countries, even the quoran that men can have more than one wife. \nbecause again that Man is put on a higher pedestal. Its no secret that Many \ncountries in the east are patriarchal societies , especially countries that \nhave islam as the rule of law. I have to keep coming back to Saudi because \nthe level of superiority is blatant thats its hard to ignore. Women are not \nallowed to leave  the house without a male escort. Women cannot drive. They \ncant even ride bicycles.\n\nIf your wearing the headscarf, like sikhs wear turbans, because its a \nspiritual thing,I get it.  But if you say your wearing it because you \nbelieve men constantly are looking at you and want to flirt with you then \nthats what I do not agree with.

How many Muslims, Christians or any \nreally know the history of the why these head dresses were introduced to \npredominantly Islamic cultures? History tells us, but most people don't \nknow history. Out of desperation it was a modest effort of extremity. No \none particular side was innocent. Actually things were horrible. \nLawlessness after the collapse of multiple civilizations brought out the \nworst in all. These head dresses were used to repel rape, in a time where \nrape, murder and robbery was normal. It stayed because people kept things \nsimple, and then it became traditional and then completely main stream. For \nthe time it worked. Though it doesn't work in Western society, mainly \nbecause we don't trust ourselves and under our system of capitalism, it \nwould be naive to trust anyone. The collapse of ancient Egypt, the \ndestruction of Carthage before, and many other warring demises, and then \nfinally the collapse of Rome, left a wake of devastation. So from that \nperspective, we can see why in Islam, thieves and murderers are dealt with \nharshly and hastily, as well as the introduction to the head dresses. In \naddition, men and women aren't equal. That's a naive concept. Though both \nneed to be treated fairly. I can accept head dresses, but I won't accept \ncomplete concealment in a Western society, for I know not to trust my own \nconcealed, let alone someone of foreign origins concealed. Imagine a time \nwhen everyone was hard. Imagine walking your daughter past 15 hard and \ndesperate men. Simple solution in a crappy time for everyone.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCui7iG7GpOwFkyo1Almhbow", "inappropriate_score": 0.56497175141242939, "authorDisplayName": "godofrock yeah", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z121u5ewlqqtxnhea222x33qxliwivzjk04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-19T04:04:26.222Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCui7iG7GpOwFkyo1Almhbow"}, "sentiment_score": -0.061585999999999974, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-19T04:04:26.222Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108426990292319064836", "textDisplay": "I'm honest with everyone.

It's ok for a woman to walk around in the street with \nnothing but a bikini on ..Isn't it Perverted to be accepting of that but \nnot be accepting of a woman that CHOOSES to be covered head to toe?!! \nWestern ideology is oppressive. Look what you have turned your women into. \nJust objects that are not valued or respected. When you have something \nprecious and valuable we Muslims like to cherish and protect it from \ndisgusting perverted prying eyes. through history the US continues to \ndemonise Islam through it's media , Hollywood, etc. I'm sick and tired of \nthe west depicting filthy stereotypes of Muslims that have nothing to do \nwith islam. All they do is brainwash the sheep into thinking Muslims are so \nweird and alien. I am a practicing Muslim woman and live in the UK. I \nintegrate with society just fine and so do many of the other Muslim women \nacross the west that wear the niqab and hijaab. Stop spewing your hatred, \nracism and prejudice!! I will never watch the young Turks again!! \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z133ebsaol33i1lfs22uu1dqnlvauxx5b04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC715w8yqXvKbtn5sLGEi4FA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Chocolate lover", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-15T15:05:33.260Z", "videoId": "ejFYdIDYxKo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC715w8yqXvKbtn5sLGEi4FA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.63768200000000008, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-01-15T15:05:33.260Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112864716845713284912", "textDisplay": "It isn't anyones business what another person wear!

I really hope that you actually chose to wear \nthe hijab by yourself, but in reality I wonder what kind of \"pressure\" your \nfamily or society may have put you under to make you wear it."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc2_vBtcJ4V57sUVDD4reHQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MaxPlayne87", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12iufy5lmjofl4zl04chfkjrvrshvd4qpo0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-30T13:18:45.145Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc2_vBtcJ4V57sUVDD4reHQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.14615599999999995, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-30T13:18:45.145Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110566285501922851477", "textDisplay": "+Miss Effenaii So you are telling us two things: firstly that women should \ncover themselves to protect themselves from men's stares because men are \nall rapists who cannot contain themselves when they see an elbow?

My cousin was amazing that day, he did something I \nwasn't able to do: he stood up for me. I was told by a policeman to put a \nheadscarf if I didn't want that kind of attention which enraged my cousin \nand we ended up going home.

That is not very clear. The \nHadith is even still debated amongst scholars. I pretty sure the hijab is \ncultural, it started before Judaism in the Middle East because of hot \nweather, even men in the Middle East cover their head.\nIn addition, the Greek geographer Strabo, writing in the first century AD, \nrefers to some Persian women veiling their faces;[9][not in citation given] \nand the early third-century Christian writer Tertullian clearly refers in \nhis treatise The Veiling of Virgins to some pagan women of \"Arabia\" wearing \na veil that covers not only their head but also the entire face.[10] \nClement of Alexandria commends the contemporary use of face coverings. \n[11][12] There are also two Biblical references to the employment of \ncovering face veils in Genesis 38.14 and Genesis 24.65, by Tamar and by \nRebekah, Jacob and Abraham's daughters-in-law respectively. These primary \nsources show that some women in Egypt, Arabia, Canaan and Persia veiled \ntheir faces long before Islam. Some interpretations say that a veil is not \ncompulsory in front of blind, asexual or gay men. \n\nSheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, previous dean of Cairo's Al-Azhar \nUniversity, called full-face veiling a custom that has nothing to do with \nthe Islamic faith. \u201cThe niqab is a cultural tradition and has nothing to do \nwith Islam.\u201d[35] The decision came from an incident in which he forced a \nschool girl to remove her niqab during a visit to an Al-Azhar school, when \nTantawy reportedly said that he would call for an official ban for the face \nveil in Islamic schools. Tantawy's decision stems from his views that more \nyounger Muslims have lost touch with traditional Islamic scholarship and \nhave come under the influence of extremist imams who have little or no \nformal training in Islamic scholarship, despite some of the most \ninfluential islamic scholars holding the position that the niqab is from \nislam. Islamic Sharia law, according to certain public pundits (e.g., Mudar \nZahran) and Islamic scholars, in fact bans women from wearing the niqab in \nMecca during worshiping rituals.\n\nThe Middle East is no surprise, Arabs control their women normally. The \nonly reason why Lebanon is like that is because of the colonization of the \nFrench for over half a century, so their more European then Arab or Muslim. \nSecondly, why not any African Muslim countries. Why always the Middle East? \nI'm sure in Africa and east Asia like Malaysia, you get those results. Some \nof this is based on culture. In North Africa, Libya, Tunisia, and Morocco \nare relatively Berber culture. So of course, Tunisia is going to be very \nliberal. Pakistan, is because of Taliban influence. If the Taliban didn't \nexist, the stats would be way off. The Bengali  women only wear hijab or \nnothing. Pakistan and Afghanistan changed after the Taliban came into \nforce. Politics plays into this as well.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdn5moNZY2JGYOTsf5CSi8g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "PureNT", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z120w51bio24dfhfs23jyjpyqlqkcladk", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-02T03:27:49.805Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdn5moNZY2JGYOTsf5CSi8g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.33788599999999996, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-02T03:27:49.805Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KKSs5YP2QpE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJM/ZppBIJBkWOU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114268377926395933334", "textDisplay": "Interestingly enough, the only reason for this Hijab wearing nonsense is \nbecause during the Prophet's time women did it.

I've already given my opinion about niqab and burqa and \nhow Islam doesn't force women to dress that way. It is out of modesty that \nwomen wear hijab and out of duty. As long as it does not hurt anyone else \nthen people should not be judgemental and look like fools when they speak. \nTo each their own. People should not judge before they have the facts and \nresearch any issue  or subject. I appreciate your comment and your manners \nin replying.
