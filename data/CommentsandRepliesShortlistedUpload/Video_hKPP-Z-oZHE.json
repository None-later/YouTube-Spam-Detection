(I know I'll \ncatch hell from a lot of liberal pansies on this but too bad).\n\n1. Yes the gun looked real.\n2. Yes mom should have never let it out of the house (except in the \ndumpster).\n\nHOWEVER when I was growing up ALL toy guns looked 'real as fuck' as some of \nyou say, and when you pulled the trigger they went BANG, not crack, not \npop, but BANG, and had smoke that came out of the barrel, and not ONCE \nduring my entire childhood did a SINGLE cop shoot a kid for playing with \none of these. They used to drive through the neighbor hood and see kids \ncarrying these and pointing them and shooting them ALL THE TIME, and NOT \nONCE did the cops even so much as stop to bother any of us let alone point \nTHEIR gun at us.\n\nHOW MANY young kids (early teens and younger, you know, the age that likes \nto play cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians etc) have SHOT a cop? Like \nZERO?? So why the hell are cops pointing guns at these kids in the first \nplace?!?! They've become OVERLY PARANOID, and have been TRAINED over the \nlast few decades to shoot first and ask questions later. Doesn't matter \nWHAT color your skin is, this has become epidemic.\n\nCops have simply become trigger happy. WHY? Because they get a PAID \nvacation while the pseudo-investigation is carried out, and are put back on \nthe street as soon as they're cleared. Society as a whole has given them \nthe GREEN LIGHT to be pussified into shooting anything that moves. Kids, \nmoms holding babies, those deadly chihuahua's penned up in the kitchen...\n\nLook at the police in other countries. Watch some \"I love Russia\" video's \nand watch the cops walk up to grown men with guns and simply take them away \nwithout drawing their own. The problem is our cops have become pussies that \nare afraid of their own shadows (and the way they've been treating the \ncitizens over the last 30 years or so, they may be vindicated in their \nfear).\n\nHere's a thought. Since ANYONE with a conscience would have problems \nfunctioning in a safe and normal manner after having shot someone the \nfollowing rule should be put into place REGARDLESS of if the shooting was \njustified or not.\n\nAny officer who causes severe physical harm or death to an individual in \nthe course of his duties will be terminated immediately. If evidence proves \nthat the officer was not only justified in causing said harm, but would \nhave more likely than not lost his or her life or failed to protect the \nlife of another by using less force, then said officer will be allowed to \nreturn to work at previous rank and pay after 1 year with counseling. Just \nlike long term disability is set up for normal jobs is used to pay people \nthat are out of work for a period of time, they should be able to file for \ndisability for a 'stress related injury' while they are off for the year \nreceiving counseling and the officer would be able to collect from the day \nof the incident if the above is determined to be the case. If an officer \nhas caused death or great bodily harm and it's proven that he or a citizen \nWOULDN'T have been injured or killed, then that officer is no longer \nworking for the police and would be barred from working in any form of law \nenforcement AND criminal charges of assault or murder will be filed.\n\nWhat would this accomplish? Well being that it was a toy gun, they couldn't \nsay they prevented their own or someone else from being injured, since a \ntoy gun wouldn't be capable of doing so. Someone beaten beyond recognition \nor choked to death simply for resisting would also fall under that \ncategory. It would cause the officer to be less of a mindless pussy, and \nforce them to THINK before pulling the trigger on a kid, or a baton on \nsomeone for resisting. Tazers work, once the cuffs are on there's no need \nto beat the shit out of someone. I don't care HOW big a guy is you don't \nneed to choke them when you have a dozen or so cops to sit on them (they \nwill get tired eventually). Each case would have to be looked at \nindividually, and a JURY should rule on the justification, not a POLICE \nINVESTIGATION BOARD. This would protect the officer that was TRULY \njustified in his actions to save a life, and STOP the bullies from having \nabsolute unimpeachable power.\n\nIs there a possibility that an officer COULD lose their life by hesitating? \nNot if they KNEW what they were doing. A grown man isn't out playing cops \nand robbers. If he draws, you bet you defend yourself. If a 6 year old has \na silver plated six shooter loaded with caps, or a BB gun, you might want \nto pass on that one (or at least wait until they shoot first, because \nchances are even if it IS real, they aren't going to be very good shots).\n\nIt's time we start hiring cops with balls that aren't AFRAID to do their \njobs without pulling the pistol the first 5 seconds of an encounter where \nthey aren't being SHOT AT.\n\nBegin hateful replies and trolling now......\n(Before you do though, just know I was trained in police work in the early \n1970's and had some of my friends I trained with were shot while on duty. \nWe WEREN'T trained to shoot first and ask questions later, we were trained \nto SERVE AND PROTECT not ENSLAVE and HANDICAP).\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiVUzxiZ6Dl0VmM5YaNjs1w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "nettaleafay", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12kcbroqt2si3zml220izbr1sbsev34j04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-04-29T08:04:29.922Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCiVUzxiZ6Dl0VmM5YaNjs1w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.442246, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-04-29T08:04:29.922Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107738599548470259158", "textDisplay": "Mike H\nI absolutely loved everything you said.
