It certainly is not a condition that \nimproves the the function of the brain or body; therefore it is a defect. \n Secondly, even the most shallow attempt to get a definition of \nAsperberger's would reveal that it causes a lack of coordination and this \nawkward or clumsiness is the major diagnostic symptoms used by doctors to \ndetermine the presence of Asperger.  Other physical symptoms including \nabnormal repetitive or compulsive behavior or ritualistic acts that require \nthe sufferer to feel compelled to perform when they are overly excited or \nstressed.  Generally, Asperger patients are highly anxious and may have a \nbreakdown when they are faced with a stressful situations that maybe \nmundane to a non sufferer.  HMMM, I think shooting up little kids may \nqualify as stressful.  I don't think seeing a little kid being split in \nhalf or brain or body tissue and blood spatter erupt from a 8 year old \nwould cause a calming affect and improve an Asperger's patient's \nconcentration and muscle control so that he becomes a cybernetic Terminator \n android.  When I was a little kid I shoot a squirrel with my pellet rifle \nand reacted by panicking and feeling a sense of OH Shit causing me to drop \nthe pellet rifle and crawl under my bed; praying for the squirrel to live. \n It did not  transform me to Aaanold and activate the heads up optical \ndisplay to identify and destroy more living things like the toddlers your \nboy continued to methodically turn into bloody pulp with superhuman \nefficiency.

The police dept is going to have a press conference sat at 3pm est. \nIt should be on line on wjrt news flint mi-they have been on the story \nsince day one.\n             About Lanza, if his dad left drugs there, wouldn't you have \nmade sure to get them out of the home...I would have. I've heard that the \nmother took him shooting. That Lt. Vance made me mad when he stated that he \nwould arrest anyone asking questions or stating rumors! I understand about \nrumors, but anyone can either ask questions or ask why procedures weren't \nfollowed. I sent him a letter telling him that I would be asking many \nthings and if he wanted to arrested me-he had my address. There IS no law \nabout asking honest questions-especially when one has some knowledge in \nthat area! Too many coincidences-and NO cop worth his or her salt, likes it \nwhen there are too many coincidences; anymore than they do when everything \nall seems to be wrapped up in a pretty bow!!! One way there are too many \nstrange things, the other way just too tidy and all. I didn't expect them \nto release photos of dead kids-but there is a remarkable amount of NOT much \nblood, bullet holes, and other things! Stories that don't add up, so many \nhappy parents! It bothers me, call it a gut feeling. Food on cop cars, no \nmajor photos or video of running children...And I know I'm different from \nmost parents, because of being a cop, but they would have had to shoot me \nbefore I made it inside if my son was in there. Even if he was torn a part, \nI would have run my fingers over his head saying over and over, how sorry I \nwas for not being there when he needed me the most!!! And yeah, maybe I \nwould have shot myself! Which is one reason why we keep parents away...But \nI sure as hell wouldn't be laughing about it like Robbie!!! You don't know \nhow bad I wanted a piece of his ass!!!

So the leading and most likely \nexplanation is Noah's picture was included by mistake because his \nname \"Pozner\" has the same first and last letters as \"Peshawar\" and \ncould easily be included in a search if Peshawar was misspelled.  \"P####r\"\n\n2. The video that originally included the mural that contained \nNoah's picture was made by a surviving teacher from Peshawar on the \nFacebook site \"They went to school and never returned\" and the grieving \nparents downloaded and reprinted the mural and used it at the memorial \nservices without doing any research. It was not an intentional thing and \nI'm sure you could easily have made a similar mistake if you had something \nthat tragic happen to you and you were blinded by grief.\n\n3. Why are you saying the \"so called Pakistani school killings\"?  Are you \nan evil terrible person?

One can also tell the differences because \nthe ear shapes, configurations and size are not the same. It is a fact that \nears are as individual as fingerprints which any Forensic photo examiners \nwould tell you.\n\nWhat you are seeing is surviving siblings and cousins at the Super Bowl, \nnot the victims. If I lived in that town and could identify each and every \nchild for you and list them by name would that help? Probably not. Even if \nwe had the names and ages of all the children involved in the Super Bowl \nsinging the Truthers would still claim that someone is lying. \n\nEven if we had absolute proof that we could shove in your faces like the \ncrime scene or autopsy photos of the dead kids, you would still claim it \nwas a lie. Why? Because your arguments are based off an irrational need to \nprove this incident false, not because of actual proof that it didn't \nhappen but because of what Politicians are using it as a platform to push \nlaws for.

You also have to be a bunch of right wing, militia \nman, religious fundamentalists, hate mongering fascists. So you can readily \ntell what area of the gene pool these people come from. There is a mountain \nof forensic evidence to support the truth of Sandy Hook, but the best that \nTruthers can supposedly come up with is inconsistencies in media coverage, \na source they shouldn't be looking at anyways because I agree with them \nthat media for the last 30+ years is and has been unreliable ever since Ted \nTurner started CNN and the 24 hours news rating wars. CNN, Fox, MSNBC and \ntheir ilk are little better than tabloids anymore. So are we surprised they \ncontinuously get everything wrong? Yet they can continue to get everything \nwrong without penalty because that's what we get with unrestricted Freedom \nof Speech. So would you rather have accurate news reports every time and \nhave Government penalties restricting free speech? The only actual \nrestriction on Free Speech is defamation laws, and normally the Average \nperson is not protected by them because you require a high powered Torts \nLawyer to be able to sue somebody in civil court to enforce them, no \ncriminal penalties or prosecutions apply."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl-FwxP5lVn2wJrFiI_b0_A", "inappropriate_score": 1.2987012987012987, "authorDisplayName": "Jody \u201cJade\u201d Cogdill", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12lirbienawwvbjs04cjfeguzravrrirfo", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-08T04:14:32.047Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCl-FwxP5lVn2wJrFiI_b0_A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29215400000000002, "formal_score": 63, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-08T04:14:32.047Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Q7Am90txpzc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADw/uq5TcD7SqXI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106716286222968244068", "textDisplay": "Of course it was on the \"news \" just like all the other bullshit they fake \nto make the truly dumb people BELIEVE ANYTHING, and react accordingly, now \nhand them ur protection and.

Kromminga First, yes I was an M.P, but if you read any of my other \npost at other sites; I explained my back round. I was at Ft. Bragg, NC. My \nfirst day there I heard the loud thump from a man slamming into the ground! \nWe had a serial killer on base. At that time, 1979, there were packers who \npacked the parachutes. Then the jumpers would just grab one as they filed \nby. The packers had to sign a card with their name on it. I have never seen \nthis case ever in print anywhere! So it must have been kept 'in house' \nhushed up. Why I don't know? The post was about serial killers. I said I \ndealt with two of them-no one believed me. Anyway, back to this one which \nwill answer your question about me being in the CID-which I think they \nchanged their letters recently. So MPs are used to protect a crime scene, \nhand out tickets, patrol, etc. I think this guy killed something like 8 \npeople. It was random as no chutes were assigned to any one person. This \nguy was signing donald duck, mickey mouse, etc. CID are the detectives who \ninvestigate the crimes. I must have been pretty smart-when I took the test \nthey said I could be whatever I wanted to be. I picked MP. There were 6 men \nwho were packers. They stopped them all from packing and made the jumpers \npack their own chutes-smart move! The killings stopped! But they couldn't \ntell which one was the killer...I suggested that they looked for someone \nwho flunked jump school. The said why? I told them when I took my training \nto become an MP that if I flunked out-I would be a cook or something. \nBecause before you took your mos training, you had to pass basic first, \nwhich meant, if you flunked your mos you were still in the army. I said \nmaybe one of these guy flunked his mos and got stuck with packing and was \nmad about it. That did it and they found their man! After that I would find \nmyself 'loaned' out to CID for different things. The other serial killer, \nwell Carter let the Cubans into our country and Castro opened up all his \njails and mental wards. That's where I found myself involved with my second \nserial killer. Be glad to answer any more questions that you might have."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtQa092HZnIY21MDW1m9jDQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "K.D.

Part of the reason that the United States Military is one \nof the best Militaries in the world, is all the wars we fight and all the \nactual field experience we have gotten.   Its the same principle with \nEmergency services training.  Field experience in handling these types of \nscenarios cannot be trained, but must be experienced, unfortunately.

Said plenty, \nyou are just too stupid to defend your position. Its not bad to question \nthe \"official story\" if you actually know that the official story is. Keep \ntelling you idiots how unreliable the press is but your main arguments are \nall based off bad press coverage. So let me break it down for you. \n\n1. The Press is at its best a Secondary Source, only when directly covering \npress conferences(Secondary because people are human and sometimes misspeak \nor mishandle press conferences in stressful situations).\n\n2. The Press is a Tertiary source when they are handling developing stories \nbecause they reports things as fact before they can fully confirm a story. \nWhy to you idiots think there is such a thing as a NEWS UPDATE, because \nthey put those out to correct errors and possibly make new errors with \ndeveloping information.\n\n3. The Press is a Quadranary source when they are giving the public their \nopinion. The old saying is \"Opinions are like a-holes, everybody has one\" \nholds true. And in my opinion most supposed information Truthers present in \ntheir videos at best is a Quadranary source because you are presenting your \nopinion of the facts, not ever the facts themselves.\n\nAny Judge in a Court of Law would laugh you out of Court if any of you \nidiots tried to present anything you heard from the press as facts. I never \nwatched the 24 hour coverage when it first came on, because I do not have \ncable and have not had cable TV for many years. I didn't even know about \nSandy Hook till at least 3 days after the fact, so my perceptions are not \ncolored by the errors that our wonderful press made when initially \nreporting the developing story. While I do have doubts about the official \nstory, because not all of the primary sources have been released and some \nwill never be released, I have no doubt that something bad actually \nhappened at Sandy Hook.

When the Press gets there before the Police cordon of the crime scene, \nlike what unfortunately happened with the Terrorist attacks in Peshawar.\n\n2. When someone, who is part of the Investigation, illegally leaks the \ncrime scene photos for money. Unfortunately there are base an reprehensible \npeople who will do anything for money and even worse people who will pay \nthem that money to do it.\n\n3. When the family members of the victims give their permission, which \nalmost never happens.\n\nTHESE ARE THE FACTS OF WHY YOU DO NOT HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION FOLKS, SO \nSEPARATE YOUR FANTASY FROM OUR REALITY."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUl8WBLeT7HpiQ6ev98Fb8w", "inappropriate_score": 1.3245033112582782, "authorDisplayName": "Damien Percy", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12rfhhjhkr0tdt5r04cjrxzkmedtzsyqis", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-11T08:02:10.842Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUl8WBLeT7HpiQ6ev98Fb8w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.30292199999999997, "formal_score": 15, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-11T08:02:23.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4LQV1Tnkz5E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALs/sUKVYF2SewE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102139784238414435503", "textDisplay": "+K.D.

And the more \nterritory they gain the more resources they have to recruit more of their \nilk from the prison systems of Europe and the Middle East. You sound like \nyou're cheering on the thugs.\n\n3. No I did not agree that my facts were wrong. Alfred Noble did have a \nchange in heart when he found out about what his inventions were actually \ndoing, through the accidental obituary. And he gave away all his blood \nmoney to change the world. I think that qualifies as repentance and even a \nredemptive experience of which most reasonable people would agree. But then \nyou are evidently not reasonable, another proof that you are not an Atheist \nor don't comprehend what it means to be an Atheist. \n\n4.

Also nobody who posts \nvideos on YouTube has one ounce of accountability for what they post \nbecause all of these pussy cowards try to remain anonymous. So when you \ncan't trust anything yet get from a 2nd hand source as fact ,what do you \nconsult?

I hate you doomsdayer religious nuts, I really do and hope \none day that when you realize that your beliefs have been twisted by \nleaders that feed you a pile of horse shit, that you pull out your guns and \nshoot yourselves( or drink the poison cool-aid like Jim Jone's Heaven's \nGate whatever you like). I hope that day is soon, because it would really \nimprove the intelligence in the gene pool for the entire Human Race. \n\n2. That being said, there will never be another war between major economic \npowers again because the world's economy is too interconnected. China sells \nthe USA too much stuff and is not in the least bit interested in losing its \nlargest market, and Russia realizes despite its posturing, the ripple \neffects that a major war will have on its economy. \n\n3. I don't agree with most of the wars that this government has gotten into \nrecently, despite the fact that I was in the U.S. Military and participated \nin two wars I did believe in Somalia and Bosnia/Kosovo. Somehow I think \nstopping genocide from happening is something most of the world would agree \non. And a large part of the world did agree in the Balkans because I had \nNATO comrades from all over the world, and even Russian comrades that I \nfought along side during that conflict.\n\n4. The United States is the only super power left in the world, militarily, \nand is the heart and driving engine of the entire world's economy. So how \nmuch greater a nation can you get then that? What exactly could you do to \nimprove on that? \n\n5. Just because the government can regulate the types of weapons that \nsomebody can acquire, doesn't mean they have infringed on someone's right \nto bear arms or legislated it out of existence. Would you want the average \nJoe to be able to get a hold of a nuclear weapon? A armored battle tank? \nWhere do you draw the line? And the militia thing is the fault of the State \ngovernments. In the beginning of the United States, we were not ever \nsupposed to have a standing army, but the State governments failed to \nmaintain well regulated militias and the Federal Government had to step in \nto correct that. Today's well regulated militia was actually replaced by \nthe National Guard system.\n\n6.
