These guitars are no different than \ncirculating Counterfeit Money into our, (Your's too) Economy!!!

Do you actually believe that the \npeople you talk to are Making your Guitar?!?  Nope, they are taking your \norder, and it is assembled accordingly! The reason for all the \nInconsistencies is because they Aren't the guitar companies that are being \nCounterfeited! There is NO QUALITY CONTROL! The curing process that is \nVital to the life of the guitar DO NOT EXIST with these \"Chibsons\" as you \npeople like to call them!\nOne person on here noted Gibson getting busted for smuggling Illegal wood! \nThat's not exactly what happened.

A buddy of mine built a LP Junior \nout of white limba with a curly oak top, and a poplar neck with Indian \nrosewood fingerboard. That guitar sings like a bird. \n\nNow he's making a LP Standard, but used alder instead of mahogany and a \nmaple neck. It's just like the real thing, only made better. \n\nDon't get stuck in tradition. Mahogany has been used because it's easy to \ncarve. Not for tonal reasons. Same with basswood. The first guitar maker to \nuse basswood was American Showster. I used to work there. We used it \nbecause it's easy to carve and light weight. Then Ibanez copied. \n\nPretty soon it will be harder to get some of these woods. So get used to \nalternatives. What's more important is the craftsmanship and construction \nof the guitar. Each wood has a certain tone, but you can substitute and by \ncombining wood reach the same tonal destination. \n\n"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdoIGHiR2DnllolZZ6OHlVw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "s. flavius mercurius", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12neftb5tr1gbexn04cgz0bounydd2j5ek", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-19T15:57:46.909Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdoIGHiR2DnllolZZ6OHlVw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.33393, "formal_score": 9, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-19T15:57:46.909Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106242576123606515098", "textDisplay": "TELL THEM SNAKE!!

Take \nall the electrics & hardware out, maybe refret it and rebuild it with the \nbest parts cos for the \u00a3200 they cost, i think it's worth it just for a \nnicely painted body and good neck regardless of where it's made.\nBy my calculations it'd cost me around \u00a3300 on top which makes \u00a3500 total \nto end up with a les paul of higher quality than any gibson, and for \nroughly the same price you'd pay for a reasonable epiphone guitar."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeprAC_19jV_HC1vw08_flw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Pistol Walker", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nwnbjukayvjinw22gdjihtqqhzndkl", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-11T00:05:23.488Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeprAC_19jV_HC1vw08_flw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99102020000000002, "formal_score": 95, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-11T00:05:23.488Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PRUL170mXPY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA2s/oSKlY7j46hA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101962697397741530703", "textDisplay": "+2010UncleFester go for it, more power to ya. enjoy those Customs.
