That's not to say that I think there are tons \nof people accusing their partners of domestic violence, but I still think \nhe shouldn't act as smug as he does \u2013 after all, TYT are on the front of \ntelling us how important innocent until proven guilty and due process are, \nand rightfully so!\nAbout the law itself: it definitely makes a lot of sense. I do see two \npotential flaws though. One is that I do suppose there will be a gender \nbias, that is if a man accuses a woman of domestic violence, the judge will \nbe a lot more likely to not confiscate her weapons.\nThe other is as follows: although it's, I suppose, only a small part of a \npercent, there will be persons wrongfully accusing their spouses of \ndomestic violence. Now that wouldn't be much of a problem itself. However, \nmy feeling is that those persons (who wrongfully accuse their spouses) are \nsignifically more likely to be erratic and dangerous themselves, and \npotentially also manipulative. So for this undoubtably small fraction of \ncases, the accuser could \u2013 deliberately or subconsciously \u2013 use this rule \nto get rid of their spouses guns and then assault them. The problem is that \neven though it only be very few cases, in those cases the consequences \nwould be catastrophic. Since as John and Jimmy noted there's also the issue \nwith the offender still having access to other types of weaponry, I think \nthey should at least have two cops (or even better people who know how to \nde-escalate) escort the supposed victim when they fetch their stuff. That \nwould improve safety for victims a lot, and might help detect the cases of \nabuse of this law (for instance if the escort witnesses the \"victim\" \nactively engaging in an argument while the \"offender\" acts passively).\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13fhdsa5kuffxaxx04ci1ubyxunwbaiyko0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0klG9ObCBCNgzgajwzo-Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ahiaUbdkcUM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABHA/54KwzZxrmvg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "kathy kelly", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-04T03:03:22.293Z", "videoId": "OkYm3hZ6yr4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCU0klG9ObCBCNgzgajwzo-Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8705137000000001, "formal_score": 13, "updatedAt": "2016-05-04T03:03:22.293Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110294178235374560138", "textDisplay": "Should we just execute ppl when they get charged with murder.

It is true that guys are \nkinda fucked.  I had a situation just like you described.  I had a crazy ex \nshow up at my house and start trouble.  She kept banging on my door and I \nwould not let her enter the house.  So she then broke the glass out of my \nfront door and hit my car.   I then called the cops.  She had left by the \ntime the cops arrived, but the police told me that because it was a \ndomestic disturbance call, they would have probably arrested me when they \narrived had she still been there, even though I was the one that called it \nin.  So, yeah. the system is kind of tilted against guys when it comes to \nthis kind of stuff for sure. Where we disagree is about the gun thing. If \nsomeone is accused, even before convicted, they do have some \nrestrictions.   Think of it this way.  Instead of domestic abuse, think of \na different crime.  Think if it was something like a mass murder.  Would \nthe accused mas murderer be allowed to just be freed to do as they please \nand even continue to carry guns around just because they haven't had their \ncourtdate yet?    Nope.

If you wanted to kill someone you could \ncall the cops and accuse the person of abuse, they would take the person's \ngun and you'd find it easier to kill them while the court goes through the \nlengthy process of deciding when to return it knowing that their asses are \non the line if the person shoots anyone with the returned weapon at any \ntime in the future. I'm not even talking about a wife killing a husband, \nANYONE can make an accusation posing as a victim or witness. ANYONE, \nbecause there has been no investigation and probably never will be. The \ncops can accuse you to find out if you have a gun before they raid you ffs. \nYou can pick a house, call the cops, and tell them you witnessed abuse \nthere. Guns gone?

If you're living under constant threat of attack in \nIraq you should try living without your gun for awhile, because that's what \nsophisticated people do and we don't get murdered. In fact, violence is \nright wing conspiracy theory and you should feel perfectly safe leaving \ndoors unlocked in East Saint Louis, especially if you have no means to \naccidentally shoot yourself. The lack of intelligence, foresight, or even a \nshred of respect for every responsible gun owner is disillusioning.\n\nYes, and a couple idiot pundits with consistently liberal agendas who care \nnothing about the existence of humanity, let alone the people involved, are \nsuddenly such authorities they can decide its fine to simply trash the US \nConstitution and let the government seize guns without your due process.

Look it \nfor yourself.\"\n\nWhat exactly am I wrong about? A court order restricting firearm access \nbased on evidence and the context of the situation is exactly what due \nprocess is supposed to be. The constitution says that someone cannot be *convicted \nor punished* for a crime until they are proven to be guilty and protects \nagainst *unreasonable* actions by courts/law enforcement. It doesn't say \nthat they are not allowed to take any action at all until a conviction is \nmade. Restricting firearm access for individuals with restraining orders is \nnot meant as a punishment, it's a safety precaution.\n\n\"You really think the American people couldn't do a better job defending \nagainst the U.S. Military then Iraqis and Afghans?\"\n\nI'll go ahead and ignore the subtle racism and simply point out that the \nAmerican population is largely old, fat, untrained, complacent, and has \nbasically zero access to hardware that could effectively combat naval or \nair forces. So yes, I think we would do an even worse job. The US military \nwould absolutely win that fight.\n\nBut once again, why the hell would the US government want to do that with \ntheir own population? Who the hell would profit from that war? What purpose \nwould it serve? If it's simply to establish some sort of authoritarian \ndictatorship, I can assure you that there are far more efficient and \neffective methods of doing that than warfare. We already effectively live \nin an oligarchy without the government having to take a single gun away. If \nyou're really worried about a tyrannical government, I suggest you turn \nyour attention toward more relevant issues like income inequality, money in \npolitics, governmental transparency, voter suppression/manipulation, and a \nlack of access to quality education.

There \nare roughly 65,000 murders in the US every year related to domestic \nviolence. Over 50% of those murders involve a firearm. Now let's look at \nthe statistics regarding how often guns are successfully used for self \ndefense annually. Most bi-partisan research on the subject estimates that \nthere are roughly 3,200 defensive uses of firearms in the US annually. Not \nall of those are going to be successful uses, but for the sake of the \nargument let's assume they all are. That's 3,200 defensive uses over a gun \nowning population of about 107 million, or about 0.003% of gun owners. How \nmany of those 3,200 people do you think were under a temporary restraining \norder at the time? Well, it's estimated that there are about 1.2 million \nrestraining order related to domestic violence in effect at any one time. \nAssuming that the rates of gun ownership and defensive use are the same \namong them as the general population, 400,000 of those people are gun \nowners, and a grand total of 12 of them used a firearm to defend themselves.\n\nIn other words, you are against legislation designed to help prevent about \n32,500 murders a year because you're afraid that maybe a dozen people won't \nbe as able to defend themselves as a result.

In my research, though, I did learn something similar to what \nthis law is proposing is happening.\n\nWhen potential domestic abusers are arrest, the potential victim is usually \ngranted a restraining order against the arrested. Sometimes this entails \nmore stringent measures, sometimes it does not. \n\nIf I remember the facts correctly, a gun can be taken from the accused if \nthat particular person has a history of violence or if the evidence of \nviolence inflicted on the victim is substantial. The issue arises when the \npolice enforcing the restraining order doesn't complete the whole of the \nconditions, whether by forgetfulness or misinformation. This was pretty \nsurprising to me since I thought the CT legislators were trying to fill in \na gap that didn't exist at all.\n\nI think that if more people knew about the provisions that can be added to \na restraining order issued in these cases, then more judges would consider \nthe option depending on the circumstances and the police would actively \nlook if there is such a provision in the fine text. \n\nI try not to put that much faith in \"good guys with guns\" since there are \nmany well intention people who haven't had the training to properly use a \ngun, which increases the potential for collateral damage.

Same way that different people charged with he same crime might \nget different bail amounts or release conditions, and how alleged domestic \nabusers might get very different protection orders or pre-trial \nrequirements.\n\nI want to know mow many women have been killed by an alleged abuser after \nthat alleged abuser got arrested and let our of jail.\n\nAnd then I want to know the number of justifiable homicides or acts of \ndefense that have been committed by alleged abuse victims against their \nalleged abusers.\n\nWhat happens if there is a gun registered to the alleged victim, and it \ngets taken away because the idea is to remove access from the alleged \nabuser? Makes sense to remove the gun from the woman under that idea. But \nwhen you remove the ability of the bad guy to do bad, you also remove the \nability of the good guy to defend himself or herself.\n\nIts a gray area is basically what Im saying.\n\nIts the kind of thing I ponder when I find myself believing that less guns \nis a good thing overall for o society, but in individual circumstances \nmaybe it is not a good thing for an individual..\n\nI might have repeated myself a few times. sorry.

Cops respond. They \ndo not witness any actual altercation, but the woman has a mark on her body \nthat could or could not be due to abuse. She says it was her husband. Cops \npretty much have to arrest the husband.\n\nBut, there is a gun registered in the wifes name.....what do the cops do? \nThe gun is registered to the wife, but it is in the same house that the \nhusband lives in. suppose the husband gets out of jail that same night, or \nthe next day or whatever.\n\nHe goes home, pissed off, angry, violent, etc.\n\nAre there laws preventing an accused domestic abuser from returning to his \nown residence while out on bail?\n\nWell, sometimes there is, depending on the judges orders. Btu sometimes \nnot. depends on the probable cause affidavit and how the judge interprets \nit. and that affidavit is written up by the cops. and it gets challenged by \ndefense lawyers as well. \n\nbut, the gun law applies universally in connecticut. if you get accused, \nyou get your gun taken away til the case is over.\n\nbut is there anything in those laws about the specifics of this scenario?\n\nif you can take away the guys gun because he was accused and the gun is \nregistered in his name, and you do this because you want to keep the woman \nsafe from hard, then doesnt it makle sense to remove the gun from the house \nentirely, regardless of who it is registered to? especially considering \nthere is no universal mandate that accused husbands will be bared from \ngoing back to their own house?\n\n\"logically\" you would want to remove the ability of that husband to get his \nhand on a gun in his own house because he might kill his wife.\n\nbut doesnt the wife have a right to defend herself from danger also?\n\nif you remove the wifes gun because the husband might get it and kill her \nwith it,. are you not also removing the wifes ability to defend herself \nfrom an abusive husband?\n\nso, does this law only apply to removing guns from a specific person, or \ndoes it apply to removing guns from the entire household? if it only \napplies to removing guns from the specific person, then how would it keep \nthe other person safe if they are the one with a registered gun and it is \nin the same house as the accused abuser who has the same ease of access to \nit?\n\nGuns are for protection, right? Havent we seen alot of cases where the \nwoman has used a gun to defend herself from an abusive man? well, how many \nof those guns were registered to the woman as opposed to the man?\n\nIts a gray area. Lots of nuance to consider here. Im saying that the \nlawmakers in connecticut might not have considered things like this when \nthey crafted this law.\n\nand again, I want data. my comment here is basically saying that for every \nhypothetical instance where removing a gun helps the innocent person, there \nis another hypothetical instance where removing the gun makes someone less \nsafe"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCERQtkrUgFeO1o613FGGrdg", "inappropriate_score": 0.10050251256281408, "authorDisplayName": "Michael P", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xenly0wzlxl1sz23cjf1ptyeazftwn04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-04T23:50:59.041Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCERQtkrUgFeO1o613FGGrdg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9607781, "formal_score": 88, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-04T23:50:59.041Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zu6YP0ma49Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEA/04xOPrhMBo8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105431577236442271247", "textDisplay": "+Mephistahpheles Here is where your argument comes to a screeching halt:\n\n\"it seems reasonable that a guilty party is most likely to use a gun \nagainst a spouse immediately after legal action is taken.\"\n\n----This issue is about people who have NOT been found guilty of anything. \nso the concept of \"guilty party\" is false considering that there are no \nguilty parties at this point.\n\nDo I feel convicted domestic abusers should not be allowed to have guns? \nWell, thats an entirely different issue. this issue is about taking away \nthe gun of someone who has not been found guilty of anything.\n\n----When you say \"most likely\", can you back that up with some kind of data?\n\nYou dont see \"freedom until trial\" as being reasonable?\n\nIt is certainly a debatable issue. Its a broad issue. Depends on the \nspecific context, as well as the broad implications and consequences.\n\nWhen i ponder the notion of \"it is not reasonable to give people complete \nfreedom while they await trial\" I have to stop and consider some of our \nsociety's fundamental principles.

Also, \ndoes an arrest for a charge justify the removal of that persons liberties? \nDoes the removal of that accused persons liberties go directly towards a \nprovable claim that it keeps society safer?\n\nI understand that you assume it logically keeps society safer, but logical \nprogressions dont hold as much weight as factual reality. they many times \ndiffer greatly.\n\nPlus, there is not much logic in assuming that an accused person truly is \nguilty of what they were accused of.\n\nSure, statistically, there might be a decent chance that they will be found \nguilty. But we dont know. and we dont know the statistical data to back \nthat up.\n\nbut why does that justify overlooking the rights of the accused in this \ninstance?\n\nBasically, I am saying I need alot more than an assertion of reasonableness \nbefore i support removing the rights of citizens who have not been found \nguilty of the crimes that they have been accused of.\n\nthis has nothing to do with bail and jail before trial, and it has nothing \nto do with removing driving rights of people who have not been found \nguilty. This is specifically about this one issue.
