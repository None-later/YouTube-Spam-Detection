John the Apostle who saw Christ in the flesh and saw him on the \nisle of Patmos has a different description of him.\n\nRevelation 1:14-15 \"His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white \nas snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; And his feet like unto fine \nbrass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many \nwaters.\"\n\nNotice his feet were like brass and then you take that brass element and \nburn it in fire it will turn black.\n\nDaniel also saw him and described him as in Daniel 10:6 \"His body also was \nlike the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes \nas lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished \nbrass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.\"\n\nNotice also here that Daniel is describing the \"colour\" of God's arms and \nfeet (Polished Brass) just like what John the Apostle saw on the Isle of \nPatmos about Christ.\n\nDaniel 7:9 \"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of \ndays did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head \nlike the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as \nburning fire.\"\n\nNotice it says that the hair is like pure wool describing the texture of it \nwhich only can be found in Negro descendants; Or the so called \"Black\" \npeople.\n\nAccording to John the Apostle and Daniel the Prophet both were describing a \nBlack Man with Woolly hair unlike a white man with thin brown hair.\n\nConclusion: Which one do you think is telling the truth?\n\nJohn the Apostle of Christ and Daniel the Prophet of God        \n\nor      \n\nColton Burpo and Akiane Kramarik?\n\nYou Decide\n\nRomans 3:4 \"...let God be true, but every man a liar;\"\n\nHere is Wisdom: We have to be careful and be on guard because Satan can \nalso transform himself into an angel of light. 2 Corinthians 11:14 \"And no \nmarvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.\"\n\nIf we received a vision or dream, just make sure your vision or dream \nmatches with the word of God - The Bible\n\nAlso it was said that his parents believed him because he told them things \nthat he should had never known. You see Satan knows everything that has \nhappen to you since childbirth because he has ministers and demons under\nhis commands. Satan knew what happen to Colton's Mother unborn baby that \nwas lost to miscarriage. He also knew Colton's Grand Father. Also even when \nColton's Father was arguing with God about the near death life of his son \nColton and how he called his parents, friends and family to ask them to \npray for his son recovery. In the bible Paul came upon a woman who was \npossess by one of these demons who knew about Paul being a servant of the \nmost high God and he cast one of those spirits out of her.\n\nActs 16:16-18\n\n16 \"And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed \nwith a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by \nsoothsaying:\"\n\n17 \"The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the \nservants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.\"\n\n18 \"And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to \nthe spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. \nAnd he came out the same hour.\"\n\nSo just because someone knows something about you without you telling them \ndoes not mean they are servants of The Most High God. Satan and his Demons \nKnows a lot about you too.\n\n2 Corinthians 11:14 \"And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into \nan angel of light.\"\n\n2 Corinthians 11:4 \"For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we \nhave not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not \nreceived, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear \nwith him.\"\n\nMeaning do not accept it and reject those who preach another Christ.\nThe Blond or Brown Hair Blue or Green eyes is another christ the False \nchrist or Anti-christ Paul and John warn us about. The True Christ is a \nBlack Man with woolly hair who looked just like the ancient Israelites from \nthe Tribe of Judah of the Bible which were black people. History back this \nup 100%.\n\nGalatians 1:8 \"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other \ngospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be \naccursed.\" \n\nLet us be careful not to received that Curse that will be place on every \nfalse preacher, teacher or anyone who see a false vision about Christ\n\nNow Colton and Akiane can very well have seen these visions of (a) christ, \nbut very well was deceived by Satan portraying a false christ to them in a \nvision.  \nWe must make sure their visions or dreams match up with the Word of God \nwhich is the Bible. If their visions or dreams contradict the Bible then it \nis not of God, but from Satan himself. Let us not be deceived by Satan.\n\nSo Colton Burpo and Akiane Kramarik's or anyone else dreams and visions \nthat contradict the Bible must be rejected according to the Bible.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12nhhzolkncvbg5404cevqibvardnygbb0": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vrBr3_Gp0EJebMuSLqnIw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CM2UY0cvHds/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAQ0c/AJLmRZ9E958/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "bayarmaa natsagdorj", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-10T09:59:08.024Z", "videoId": "lawiKeRUiK8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6vrBr3_Gp0EJebMuSLqnIw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.11742399999999997, "formal_score": 12, "updatedAt": "2014-11-10T09:59:08.024Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105845217475301277297", "textDisplay": "Heaven is real.

I know. I really never entertained the notion \nthat others would take the time to read our volley. I can't say I'd be \nterribly shocked should someone at some point pick our talk out and read it \nin its entirety. But, definitely not expected or likely. Moving on........\nI must say, your last comment was much more congenial than your others. \nWell, in tone. I suppose the content was still fairly dark but I'm not \ngonna expect to have my cake and eat it too. Maybe it's just Cuz you were \npreparing for supper. No time to get fully into character.... who knows. \nAs far as the information goes, you know, the stuff you handed over on a \nbeaming silver platter? Look, here's the deal. And I may be incorrect in \nwhat I expect, but I don't see that changing. Ok so, I have 3 kids. One of \nwhich is just a wee little package at 1 year old. The other 2, while much \nmore independent, I still devote a great deal of time to. I help with \nhomework nightly, I've coached both of their little league teams for the \nlast 3 years, I attend all plays and strings concerts. All this while \nbuilding the same strong bond with the new baby so that later in life when \nI attend her functions, she isn't thrown by my attendance, forcing her to \nbe coy or under/over perform, etc. I'm not claiming model parent with this \nbreakdown though. I'm merely trying to illustrate that my consumption of \ntime is very compartmentalized and indeed, very parse. I don't go out and \nparty or whatever so when I do get a few minutes here and there, I get on \nGoogle plus or youtube because it seems to be a very satisfying way to \nspend my free time. I try to educate myself most of the time. But I don't \nhold back feelings upon watching something that I can only describe is a \ncomplete bullshit, money grab farce. I comment on a fair amount of videos \nspanning a vast number of topics. Fast forward to our talks. \nWhen you came out and stated that you have gained, and are currently in \npossession of some unique kind of miracle proof backing up your claim, ya I \nwant you to post it. I don't wish to do searching. Especially for what I'm \nvery skeptical about having taken place to begin with. You can call it \nlaziness if you want but even if I wasn't lazy at all, I have enough going \non around me all the time that I'd likely forget rather quickly anyhow. \nThen factor in how you won't provide the proof you claim that you have, and \nI don't see my view on the matter being all too strange. \nI'm not going to be repenting. I know you think you're trying to be helpful \nas you were indoctrinated to these ideas likely at a very impressionable \nage. So I'm not going to get upset about that. Just maybe can the \nscripture. I mean, if I know I'm not flipping and you know I'm not \nflipping, what's the point? \nAlso too, I enjoyed the subtlety of your last threat. You know, the one \nwhere you knew someone like me and that things ended very badly for him. \nLike what? Did he die? That is sad but it happens to everyone eventually. \nI'll close on this note. You can mock my choice of major all you want. \nBesides, that shit was almost 8 years ago. Hey, you can even mock my \nabsence of faith. Have at CTher. But if youre gonna advertise that \nyou've got unquestionable evidence for a god, I'd argue that is more yot \nnecessity to e row "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEqI76fgtJ4J0kpbYj3DDCw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Vivian Gendernalik", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mghvjbv2lhfik522kcdhbjoe5djkj204", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-19T22:59:44.347Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEqI76fgtJ4J0kpbYj3DDCw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.17358800000000002, "formal_score": 7, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-19T22:59:44.347Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oPgqRsrbAUU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEc/3cnWcmN_Y-0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106553178831706431676", "textDisplay": "Hey, +Josh Ruble , so surprised to hear back from you.

Maybe you \nshould stop trying to 'psych' me out as a psych major. I totally agree with \nyou Josh, that unless you, Josh, see God, you are not going to believe it. \nI said that around 4 or 500 lines ago in some comment above; that is what \nDoubting Thomas was like.\n\nWhat you have proved in all your returns to me is that, for now at least, \nyou are an unbeliever.  As an unbeliever, you will NEVER find God. He will \npurposefully hide his existence from you while you can be saved, so you \nwill not have the opportunity to turn from your sin and be saved. That is \nlike the severity of God's wrath against those not in faith, to make sure \nsuch a person reaps what he has sown.\n\n\"So, you see, it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who \nwants to come to him must believe that there is a God and that he rewards \nthose who sincerely seek him.\" Hebrews 11:-6\n\nSince you refuse to do this, humble yourself and seek God's presence, you \nmost certainly will never see God except for judgment when your fate is \nsealed. You have it mixed up that you think in your defiant anger against \nthe reality of God, he is going to show himself to you. God doesn't need \nyou; you need God.\n\nI also don't need to do a personal song and dance for you to convince you \nof my reality as you can read some for free in my book \"Born In A War \nBetween Dark and Light\" in Amazon's  'lookinside' feature, or you can get \nmy story from Fate.com published in August 1989 issue called \"Paranormal \nTimes in Apartment 5-110\" or you can search the Miami Herald newspaper free \narchives for the news story published October 28, 1979 titled \"Is old hotel \nhaunted? They seek answers\" where my friends and I caught on old-fashion \ntape recorder a supernatural voice night we spent in what was called \n\"World's Largest Haunted House\" Biltmore Hotel. I am the one with first \nname \"Vivian\" in each of those that show me pictured in the articles.\n\nBut you, Josh, still won't believe with these few examples from my many \nthrough my life stemming back 35 years to show long-standing experiences, \nand so I save my sharing of my experiences to build up believers or those \nwho will believe scheduled to be saved if they hear the good news.  Then I \nwill be fruitful. But with an unbeliever, it is a vain exercise, vain wheel \nturning, as some no matter what, will stay stiffed-neck against believing."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA", "inappropriate_score": 0.088417329796640146, "authorDisplayName": "Phunny Munny", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mghvjbv2lhfik522kcdhbjoe5djkj204", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-18T20:30:03.980Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.50824800000000003, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-18T20:30:03.980Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1hzIBltc400/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFlM/64-jSWGvrkU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113605539482073704610", "textDisplay": "+Vivian Gendernalik lol. I think you may have missed the whole point in \nwhat motivates me to engage with you dedicated Christians then, m'lady. I \ndon't do it to convert anyone, and I'm not curious as to what your vantage \npoint is either. Cuz your vantage point and your estimation of what real \ntruth is concerning the existence of a deity is absurdly wrong. My goal is \nto believe as many true things and as few untrue things as possible. That \nbrings me to something you said about me that is incredibly false. You said \nI would stay close minded to evidence that a god exists, and that is a \nridiculous claim. That ones easy. If I saw actual verifiable evidence \nproving his existence, or if I actually saw the god then I'd really have no \nchoice but to believe in its existence. It's kinda dumb to think otherwise. \nBut the problem is, you've not shown me real proof. You've done the \nfollowing: told me of sections in your book where you claim proof lies, but \nrefuse to provide said sections. Hey I don't blame ya. It's like, if you \nwanted to see my gold medals for bobsledding which I won in Barcelona, I'm \nnot gonna go through all the crap needed to provide pictures. You can go \nlook for yourself. Lol. Hehe, you've typed incredibly lengthy responses to \nme, but you just can't see wasting the time of backing up your claims, even \nthough you state that it's already in print somewhere. Ya, okay. Moving on. \n...\n\nYou didn't give me your exact take on evolution, only to leave me lost in a \npile of my own stupor. And you know that. What you did was just claim that \na bunch of scientists are inept and you loosely touched on being open to \nthe idea that they could coexist. I'd hardly call that an overall synopsis \non the matter. But no worries, it really doesn't matter, that was more for \nfun why u asked that. And pardon me for thinking that two adults could have \na conversation without one of them, when in absence of actual substance or \nmerited point, tossing in insignificant filler bible bologna. One thing I \nnoticed though in your latest return, you seem to be getting perturbed a \nbit. Even frustrated with the me and what I can only classify as not giving \nyou the rebuttals you're looking for. Your tone and word choice, plus your \ndigs at my age, display that you are getting increasingly angry with what I \nhave to say, and my refusal to fall for the same crap you have been for \ndecades. Lemme just point out that you actually wrote a full paragraph on \nhow you think I'm showing youth because I assumed you saw my pic and could \nhave come to that very conclusion yourself easily. Lol. Good work. I'm a \npsych major, and I can tell, as much as you wanna deny it, that I'm \nstarting to get on your nerves. You've likely not been called out before on \nthis evidence bullshit.

You are going to stay closed minded to \neverything about God no matter what evidence you are presented. You may \nbelieve you look open-minded because you call me closed minded, but your \nwritings, or your works, show your persistent closed mindedness.\n\nI did give you my exact take on evolution; it just went over your head, is \nall. I also gave specific scientific evidence explaining my stance showing \nproof of God by science using a quantum physics study supporting it, but \nagain, it just went over your head. It is not my problem if you do not have \nthe knowledge to grasp the meaning of my answers, and so, dumbly, return \nthat I said nothing specific. S'okay, kid, whatever you say.\n\nYou are a dyed-in-the-wool classic individual who refuses to believe, and \nso choses to stay cut off.\n\n\"They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God \nbecause of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart.\" \nEphesians 4:-18\n\nSee, it is a persistent hardness of heart to the message that marks a \nperson as unsaved. You don't want to believe my reality, you don't want to \nreceive any truth from the Bible, you don't want to believe any scientific \ntheories that support God. I call that a hardened mind totally closed to \nreceiving anything. To be truthful, only those with faith are saved, so you \ndon't have to worry about that, since you have no faith and are content in \nthat state.\n\nIt is not my place to turn your mind, or work for your salvation, because \nit is each person's burden to work out their own. So if you want to stay in \ndarkness, it is all your choice, and whatever that leads to, you will find \nout soon enough, but this is what the Bible says what that leads to:\n\n\"But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for \nyourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be \nrevealed.\" Romans 2:-5\n\nAnd if you don't want to read Bible quotes, then don't initiate \nconversation with a dedicated Christian, a real easy solution.\n\nAnd again, you show your youth in this last reply stating it is clear you \nare under forty from your profile picture, as this shows you are very \nunaware there a lots of people showing pictures from their younger days as \nif them today in their profile pictures, or they are even using pictures \nthat are not themselves. I don't claim facts on assumptions, when I say \nsomething I take in consideration all angles that can be and it was \nprobable that picture was not even you, or you from years gone by. So your \nreasoning stays consistently faulty, and hostile in that faultiness, \nanother son of perdition trait.\n\nThis is the point where I follow Apostle Paul's example in Acts 18:-6 and \nturn and shake my feet in the dust, leaving you to your own convictions, \nhowever, free of any guilt on my hands. All a Christian is called to do is \nshare the good news, and if a person believe, then they are saved; if they \nrefuse to believe, then they stay unsaved. Simple, because it is not a \nChristian's job to convict, but the Holy Spirit's. How far a Christian is \nto go is explained in the Great Commission:\n\n\" 15 And he said to them, \"Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to \nthe whole creation. 16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but \nwhoever does not believe will be condemned.\" Mark 16:-15-16\n\nIt doesn't say whoever does not believe to chase after them, and plead with \nthem, and give them example after example. No. It says instead whoever does \nnot believe is condemned. There are other Scriptures to show those who are \nof God, will just believe."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA", "inappropriate_score": 0.3673094582185491, "authorDisplayName": "Phunny Munny", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mghvjbv2lhfik522kcdhbjoe5djkj204", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-17T04:02:01.865Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.15914999999999996, "formal_score": 18, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-17T04:02:01.865Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1hzIBltc400/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFlM/64-jSWGvrkU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113605539482073704610", "textDisplay": "Stupid enter button.

Such as how the bible wants you to believe that a 800 year old and his \n700 year old sons built a boat big enough to house every single breed of \nevery animal. Bullshit. Total bullshit. Anyway, I'm drifting from my point. \nMy point is that none of what you've offered serves as proof of a god. When \nyou opened up into this conversation with me, you stated that you had proof \nand it was my position that you didn't. And you don't. You have things that \nyou twist and manipulate into the following explanation made of cherry \npicked bullshit into what you consider sufficient. It's a shame that you \nfell so hard for the indoctrination you're under, because you seem like an \notherwise very intelligent individual. And were it not for the giant \nfictional elephant in the room, I'd say you have a good ability to discern. \nThat's nice that you're not looking for my approval on matter. I'll respond \nto that unnecessary exclamation with an \"I don't give a shit\" and a \"wasn't \nafter your approval anyhow\". \nI'll end with levity, on two separate items. First, bravo on your \nastonishing assessment of what you perceive my age must be under. Lol. My \npicture is posted by every comment I make. It's pretty obvious I'm under \n40. That doesn't make my words gain or loser merit however. And lastly, \nyour point of view on science is one of being not completely understanding \nof how things work. Of course they are proving past assumptions wrong. \nThat's what they do. Scientists are never out to prove that a theory is \ncorrect. They don't want that. They want to prove theoroms wrong in order \nto better understand our world and quite possibly, how we got here. You \nnever really touched on whether or not you realize evolution is a fact or \nnot though. You spoke merely of science as a whole in great big \ngeneralizations. No need to correct it, as this is exactly the response I'd \nexpected you to return with It tells enough of the story which is your true \npoint of view. I close with this. If something happened and it was as \ndefinitive of a thing as I'd ever seen or witnessed, and it lent to the \nidea that God was real and such..... I'd change my mind in less than a \nheartbeat. Honestly I would. But the peculiar thing is, should the same \nexact evidence come about to you disproving the existence of your god, you \nwould not change your mind at all or even give the phenomena you witnessed \nany consideration. You'd just chalk it up to thinking that wascly ol devil \nbeing at it again. It is that clear close mindedness alone which helps me \nfeel more convicted in my position that god isn't real. A closed mind has \nalready determined that it's only got so much room for knowledge. And \ngenerally, there isn't much room left in that predetermined space.

A lot of us have lives and \nreasons why we can't reply right away, or maybe not follow through again. \nSuch things don't mean a concession of one's stance. Mature enough folk \nknow that.\n\nNow here again is the failure of using posts to converse: you seemed to \nbelieve I was actually thinking you were drinking, and missed I was \njesting, making an irony to you of that kind of persistent mindframe you \ngive me that by just saying over and again something to me about what I \nhave gone through I will change my mind. So I just gave you a reply that to \nme painted a perfect irony of your method or attitude, a 2-beer theorem, \nsomething that I like to tag such foolish approach.\n\nNow to address your self-control thumb-nosing to me: Since you don't \nunderstand the Bible explanation of the self control Christians are to \nhave, you mix it up with your ideas which leaves you to believe it means I \nshould be refrained in my Christian faith. But, again, the Bible instructs \nus to be zealous in our faith, to uphold our first love (passion) for \nChrist, and in that it is sin to be refrained and lukewarm, as Christ will \nspit out the lukewarm Christian as Revelation 3:-16.\n\nSince it clearly appears it is convenient to you when you use the Bible and \nwhen you don't, and then come back when I rightfully reply to your \nreferences of it and your references to God, that I am again shoving the \nBible on you, that is just a ridiculous double-talk behavior to make your \npoint of view seem right to make your indignation seem right about such \ntalk from me, when it is clear you are initiating that dialogue.  Again, \nany name calling and derisions you use are just your fulfilling a son of \nperdition role and doing the devil's work and to that I gently rebuke.\n\nNow to end with your 'test' question to me about science data proving earth \nbillions years old & evolution and the clash you see with 6000 year old \nBible on age: You say to me, \"I can't wait to hear back from ya on this \none.\" S'okay, here I go. I say test because you are judging if I meet your \napproval of a 'sane' Christian versus your disapproval of a 'crazy' \nChristian. Just have to add this comment that a true Christian does not \never, ever, ever worry about pleasing man and/or meeting a man's standard.\n\nOne who does, the Bible says, makes himself an enemy of God because it is \nnot possible to please man and please God, as in trying to please man one \nwill ultimately compromise something of God's will to do it. So don't think \nI am answering to meet your test; I am answering to show there is actually \na scientific answer to explain this timeline and uphold the Bible.\n\nI want to state first that the Bible says God created earth in 7 days. The \nBible also tells us that God's time frame is different than ours, in both \nProverbs and 2 Peter:\n\n\"But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is \nlike a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.\" 2 Peter 3:-8\n\nSo this 7 days, whose time frame is it really in, since Man showed up in \nthe 5th day. If it is God's time frame, then it could be a thousand years \nor more before this 5th day as it is called man God created. There wasn't a \nreporter standing around with an almanac counting those days to our \ndefinition. It says those days but the Bible also has defined God's idea of \na day not like man's counting.\n\nAll the same, let's say that they really are 7 days as we count them. To \nthis I say, I think you must be less than forty years of age with wording \nyour question in such a way.\n\nWhy do I say that? Not to deride you, but because a person not closer to my \nage, but a couple decades less or more, has not followed the world science \nnews long enough to have sat through all of the changes in mind science has \nexhibited in the media in its definite scientific data on everything \nincluding what is the actual earth age.  \n\nIn my years I have seen science change its data so many times, accepting \none thing, then rejecting, that it has been like watching a person come of \nage changing his mind so many times along the way of what is and what is \nnot.\n\nWhat science is discovering in its wishy-washy journey, is something that \nappears to be something but then new data overrides that something and that \nnew something changes all that, so the cycle actually has never lasted in \nstone but been re-written too many times I care to follow, so I lost \ninterest and saw the folly of man's wisdom.\n\nSo science's approach to what is reality I explain perfectly in my chapter \n3 in my book you do not wish to read, and to this view of yours I say fair \nenough you don't have to, but to that view I will not reiterate what I have \nalready said so perfectly in one place available to read for free through \nthat Amazon 'Look-Inside'.\n \nWhat I am getting at is the dating of science, and what its \u2018facts\u2019 are \nreturning, mirror the science theory called \u2018schrodinger's cat,\u2019 which can \nbe summed up to say:  What you expect, is what you find. This proven \nscientific theory shows that physical evidence, as in atoms, meet the \nexpectation of the seeker.  This has been shown to be a real-world \nlaboratory theorem in use today in real work applications.\n \nSo, this involves a reality you don't seem to like, but science supports, \nand that reality is that atoms, matter, can meet the viewer\u2019s expectation, \nbut I take it a step further to raise the connection that an outside \nintelligence is controlling that schrodinger's cat reaction, and molding \nreality to an end of either for good, or for evil.\n \nThus, those researchers believing and seeking in whole ancient datings, \nmatter is accomodating, which explains all the wishy-washing discoveries, \nearlier, later, etc.  As you only believe in what you see, fixed, you buy \nwhatever is fed to you.\n \nHowever, the Bible also shows that outside of Adam and Eve\u2019s family there \nwere unfriendlies races on the earth. Cain shows this in Genesis 4.\n \nSo I say you are buying a ball-and-cup-trick of matter ala the \nschrodinger's cat theorem, and what you find via scientific expectation is \nnot necessarily what really is.\n \nAlso, we learn from the Bible there was another race treading on earth, \nbreeding, alien to men, and called the \u2018sons of God\u2019 who created with their \nrebel breeding offsprings named Nephilim.\n\n\"The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the \nsons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to \nthem. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.\" Genesis \n6:-4\n\nWhat kind of races these \u2018sons of God\u2019 were responsible for, who knows? \nOnly the Nephilim, and Anakim were named, but these rogue \u2018sons of God\u2019 may \neven have bred with simians, making Cro-Magnon men so close like us, yet \nbreed apart, just as the Nephilim were breed apart from men.\n \nSo I do not denounce any discoveries of science dating early people \nstretching past the accounting of the history back to Adam, but what I do \ndenounce is that it is actual proof.\n\nI feel instead it mirrors the schrodinger's cat and gels with what Roger \nMorneau wrote about in his book \u201cTrip into the Supernatural\u201d where he got \ninvolved in a Satanic group that had actual meetings with Satan and through \nthat learned these creationist ideas were cooked up by Satan, and in that \nend, asI see it and not what Morneau claimed, data planted and molded by \nhim to supply such evidence people would believe, not unlike someone \nwanting to make the world believe they have the Dead Sea Scrolls and create \nfake evidence using sophisticated means to fool the world. \n\nSo I am saying it is a cross or mix between schrodinger's cat and wiles of \nsatan, with the purpose to sow doubt and lead people astray, an age old \nplan as the one satan pulled on Eve about the apple. She bit into that lie \nas others are biting into this one, and so dismissing all of the Bible."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA", "inappropriate_score": 0.32113037893384716, "authorDisplayName": "Phunny Munny", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mghvjbv2lhfik522kcdhbjoe5djkj204", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-15T21:59:20.336Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.47839199999999998, "formal_score": 11, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-15T21:59:20.336Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1hzIBltc400/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFlM/64-jSWGvrkU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113605539482073704610", "textDisplay": "+Vivian Gendernalik okay, well....I wrote out a lengthy reply to your \nlatest posting a couple of days ago.  However, due to shotty internet \nconnection at the time, it was dropped when I sent it.  I was taken back by \nthe failure of my phone and said to myself its not worth re-typing all of \nthat again.  ultimately, I remain in that frame of mind.  but I will touch \nupon some of the key points, and then finish off with a question. \n   First, lemme clarify a few things and correct some as well.  as I stated \nbefore, using bible verses, no matter how much clout they may carry with \nyou, won't convey any info to me, as I put no validity whatsoever into the \nbook from which they're taken from.  I wasn't just saying this before as \nlip service.  please refrain from going that route simply for the sake of \nwasted time in conversation.  Also, its comical, given that you have been \nmade aware of my position on the matter, that you suggest that I harbor \nnegative thoughts about this god character.  this is obscenely  false and \nyou know it.  the only reason I pointed out what a monster he is by citing \nexamples present in the bible was to illustrate how absurd of a story it is \nand that it is really a morally bankrupt tale of terrible acts and should \nnot be used as a moral guide by any means.\n    You also assumed that I was drinking while putting together my original \nretort.  I guess since I think differently than you on particular matters, \nthat its tough for you to wrap your mind around it, so......ya ya he must \nbe drinking. YES!   yes he's drinking.  it couldn't possibly be because not \neveryone thinks like me. yes, he must be drinking.  so I will tell him to \ngo have another sip of beer.  that'll be clever.  Sorry to break it to ya, \nbut I don't drink alcohol.  I don't have a problem with it, or people who \ndo, I just choose not to.  I just don't see the benefit, and I've already \ndone my partying. \n    you  like to talk about your self control, but you do not show it.  you \nhave taken every chance you've gotten to let me know that I will be going \nto hell for my lack of belief.  seems to me a normal,  caring person would \njust tend to leave the matter alone.  live and let live.  then you put \nyourself on the Christian pedestal, saying youre trying to save me.  I call \nbullshit, and that is just a candy coated diversion for the evil that is \nspouted from Christians mouths.  I see how you all are so excited and how \nyou salivate when telling others that they are going to hell.  you get a \nsick pleasure from it and its repugnant.  I don't care how many times you \ntell me that you have proof, you don't.  and im not trying to jedi mind \ntrick you or whatever the fuck that  means.   trust me when I say, I do not \nwish to sway you to my line of thinking.  I only wish to influence those \nwho show no need or want to be ignorant to science, facts, and those who \ndon't claim superiority unless warranted. \n   okay, so there is a shortened version of what I'd wrote and lost \nearlier.  Now my question.  This for me, will be ultimately indicative of \nwhether or not you're a devout Christian but still with some degree of \nsanity.  or if you're one of the bat shit crazy Christians that this world \nis so full of, disgustingly.  ok, here goes:\nGiven  the fact that the evolutionary theory is undeniably correct in its \nassessment of adaptation of species, and also the dating of this planet \nbeing roughly some 6-8 billion years of age.  This is proven by the way.  \nhow do you  explain the completely asinine timeline which the bible lays \nout, and that all creatures were made at once and that the earth is only \n6000 years old?  keep in mind, you cannot say evolution isn't a fact.  this \nis not a defense.  it is total ignorance to suggest evolution did not take \nplace. furthermore, it is a total lie to state that the earth is only 6000 \nsome odd  years old.  we have the scientific evidence beyond the shadow of \na doubt that that notion is completely false.  so, what is your take?  I \ncan't wait to hear back from ya on this one."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEqI76fgtJ4J0kpbYj3DDCw", "inappropriate_score": 0.29928918817807709, "authorDisplayName": "Vivian Gendernalik", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mghvjbv2lhfik522kcdhbjoe5djkj204", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-13T09:20:55.001Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEqI76fgtJ4J0kpbYj3DDCw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.32197000000000003, "formal_score": 11, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-13T11:07:52.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oPgqRsrbAUU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEc/3cnWcmN_Y-0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106553178831706431676", "textDisplay": "+Josh Ruble wow, a guy who thinks he can do a Jedi trick on me and make me \nagree with him my reality is gone. Now that, Josh, is truly laughable, your \nsilliness. How many beers did it take for you to keep thinking if you keep \nstating my experiences I had are not real, that I will actually agree with \nyou?  Maybe that tactic works well with you with say 5-year-old kids, but \nhonestly, you ought to give that lame tactic up. \n\nTell you what, on your next beer sip time, tell me how many times it takes \nfor you to say the Grand Canyon doesn't exist that it disappears. I say \nthis because you absolutely believe you have this power of persuasion that \ncan erase realities. And here you have said you do not believe in the \nsupernatural, but yet, you keep trying to manipulate reality with voodoo \nmagic statements that can make reality contort to your statements.  Wow, \nthat must be some beer.\n\nBut you are right that my analogy about Kryptonite and Superman was not the \ngreatest as I didn't mean Scriptures make you weak, but that you avoid it \nat all cost with a great dislike as Superman dislikes pretty heavily \nKryptonite.\n\nBut, I've got to say this new statement of yours is easy to overcome where \nyou said: \"And this hell place, not mentioned one time in the old \ntestament.\"\n\nWow, sure, if you are thinking that it will be in English, but it is in \nHebrew, which is what the Old Testament is about. Hell is mentioned 31 \ntimes in Hebrew in the Old Testament. The Hebrew word is 'sheol'. And \nthough it was not described by the English or Hebrew word, here is another \nOld Testment place where it was described:\n\n\"\"And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled \nagainst me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them \nwill not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.\"\" Isaiah \n66: 24.\n\nAnd this Isaiah 66 I quoted above is a real beaut to show your ignorance \nhere because this is the Scripture Jesus himself quoted to described hell \nand what happens there in Mark 9 verses 47-48:\n\n\"\"If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to \nenter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast \ninto hell,  'where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.'\"\n\nSo here easily I tied both the Old and New Testament to disprove your claim \nhell is not mentioned even once in the Old Testament. Since Jesus himself \nuses Isaiah 66 words to say what hell is, which is  'where their worm does \nnot die and the fire is not quenched,' and Jesus was a Jew and using that \nscripture as it means, this bats down those less familiar with the Old \nTestament who say sheol is another place. This Isaiah scripture was all \nabout hell to the Jews as the words above of Jesus tells us modern folks.\n\nNext thing you will be trying to tell me is because the name Jesus is not \nmentioned in the Old Testament that it is a bit peculiar that it only \nsurfaces in the New Testament.  There are more passages in the Old \nTestament that describe this place of torment. So just because you can't \nfind it by the exact English name in the Old, doesn't mean it is not there. \nWhat it shows is you don't regularly read the Bible. So it is better you do \nnot try to trip me up with Bible knowledge as you surely are not schooled \nenough in that topic for that.\n\nHere is another thing you don't know concerning God acording to the Bible \nwhich you revealed in your talking about the 500 kids under the age of 3 \nwho die in Africa every day, of which you are falsely believing these \nlittle unfortunate kids go to hell.\n\nThis news may make feel better, because Deuteronomy 1: 39 we see God \nexempting children under the age of knowing right from wrong from his \npunishment. They got the promised land taken from their disobedient \nparents. Then 2 Samuel 12 David makes a statement that when he dies he \nshall be with his infant son who had just died. Then we see that the Lord \nhas a special love for children in Matthew 19 saying that the kingdom of \nheaven belongs to such. So terrible as it is about the children dying in \nAfrica, we have assurance from the Bible that these children too young to \nknow right from wrong are not under God's wrath, and the Lord has a special \nlove for little children.\n\nHere you are harboring all of these negative untrue beliefs about God. If \nyou cracked open a Bible and read it cover to cover, you would find some of \nthese ideas you have are not so. Yes, God is wrathful; yes, God is scary \nserious to sinners. But young children under the age of accountability are \nnot counted in God's wrath. That is why in the Old Testament when God was \nultra mad with the Israelites and swore they would not make it to the \npromised land but march in the wilderness until they perished, God said \ntheir children under the age of accountability would be the ones he would \nbring to the promised land.  So here you are without grounds and wrongly \ncalling God obscenities.\n\nYeah, this Bible verse definitely speaks about you for sure: \"But these \npeople blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like \nunreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and \ndestroyed, and like animals they too will perish.\" 2 Peter 2: 12\n\nHere you are dissing God about matters clearly you do not understand. You \nmake this wrong statement, and that wrong statement, and it is so easy for \nme to show you your scriptural error. But you don't need much rope to love \nto write obscenities about God, and then turn around and call me a \ncold-hearted person.\n\nBut you are on to something: what you perceive as cold-hearted from me, \nprobably referencing that I don't erupt at you and answer instead in calm, \nsteady replies, is actually how all Christians are supposed to behave, \nwhich is to model ourselves after Christ as:\n\n\"He did not retaliate when he was insulted, nor threaten revenge when he \nsuffered. He left his case in the hands of God, who always judges fairly.\" \n1 Peter 2: 23\n\nSelf-control is one of the traits a Christian is called to follow, as well \nas patient endurance and gentle rebuking to correct on any errors. This \nmight be foreign to you, and so you perceive it as cold-hearted. That is \nthe problem of discussions by posts as the face of the party responding is \nnever seen and so my lack of raging emotions may come across to you as \nthat, which don't think I am not sympathetic to you; I do care about you or \nI would not bother responding. You remind me of my nephew, brother and a \nfew other male relatives I know of at your age.\n\nAnd I have to say one thing to you about my claiming moral high ground: \nGod's standards are high; only the holy will see God. The Bible even says \nfew make heaven; and Apostle Paul said all of us were to work out our \nsalvation in fear and trembling. I am serious about my Christianity and I \nwant to get to heaven, so it means no compromise on the teachings of Jesus, \nas I will be barred to heaven as anybody for not preaching it 100% right, \nmeaning not changing the message to please anybody or make myself more \nliked."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA", "inappropriate_score": 0.28392958546280522, "authorDisplayName": "Phunny Munny", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mghvjbv2lhfik522kcdhbjoe5djkj204", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-13T04:11:14.301Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.59394199999999997, "formal_score": 12, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-13T04:11:14.301Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1hzIBltc400/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFlM/64-jSWGvrkU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113605539482073704610", "textDisplay": "+Vivian Gendernalik well that was certainly a long winded, unnecessary \npiece of laughable content. You must not have really grasped it when I \nmentioned it before. I'll say it again, but I cannot dumb it down any \nfurther as it was fairly basic and straight forward to begin with. Your \nbible verses, I'm afraid, don't have any kind of effect on me. Even \npointing out how much you think a particular verse in has to do with our \nconversation. Zero effect multiplied by stress factor still equals zero. \nI'm not sure how you'd gather that scripture to me was like kryptonite to \nsuperman. That's just a poor analogy. But anyway, lemme get right to the \nheart of my response. \nThanks for the lovely offer but I'm gonna pass on reading the book. You're \nnot realizing that just Cuz you wrote it, doesn't mean it happened. And \nit's not easy to fashion so called witnesses for anything you want. \nEspecially in small groups. I'm not naive for what would, with quite a \nneeded and lengthy stretch, make me seem somewhat naive according to a book \nwhich is obscenely false. So you're wrong there too. And before I go any \nfurther, lemme point out that yes, I'm aware that you don't care about my \nopinions and that you don't care if I believe ya. Lol. That's kinda how \narguments/debates tend to go. I'm not here to convert you. To the \naccusation that I'm blaming god for something, I find that quite obviously \nimpossible. I would have to believe he exists in order to place blame on \nhim. I dunno about others, but I don't lay blame for anything on anything \nnon existent. That's silly. And the whole example of me being in the \nhospital on life support has nothing at all really to do with my disbelief. \nI don't ever cite it as such either. The only reason I even brought it up \nwas because you said something assuming I'd never been in that situation \nbefore. When in fact, I had been. Typical Christian, always assuming they \nknow it all. I only said that I didn't have a holy experience because I \ndidn't. And the scope of our talk so far would ask that that question be \ntouched upon if indeed it was brought up for whatever reason. \nIn summation, I don't believe your claim that you've seen god and have \nproof. If you did have proof, more people would be aware of it. You have \nsomething you've interpreted as proof good enough to satisfy you. People \nall over the globe do that. So my second hand reports which verify that the \nearth is round proof I'd say actually has much more merit than your \nexperience. And that's not me being stubborn, that's me being cognizant of \nreality. And this hell place, not mentioned one time in the old testament. \nA bit peculiar that it's only first included upon the writing of the new \ntestament. Sounds like an addendum to the brainwash book to me. A bit of a \nwhoops! We forgot to include destination for those who say they know we're \nlying about this whole god sham. I'll give ya a hint, it never did exist to \nbegin with. I don't think youtube has any evidence relating to hells \nauthenticity either. Frankly, if you think that, you're quite a bit off \nyour nut. And I wouldn't exactly call it an anti Christian view. It's \nactually an anti religion view. Christians just tend to be the opposition \nmore frequently than others Cuz well, I live in the usa. If I lived in the \nPhilippines you'd see me more heavily in the catholics. If India, the \nMuslims, and China, the Buddhists. Just as you'd be worshipping likely a \ncompletely different deity if you were born in a different country. I'll \nclose with this. And please understand that I'm not blaming god for this. \nI'm merely pointing out how absurd it would be if it were true. Which it \nisn't. So, some 500 kids under the age of 3 every day, die in Africa. They \nall lived their entire short lives in total strife, and none had heard the \ngospel or the revelations. So they couldn't be saved according to your good \nbook which means that not only did they have to endure a horrible life on \nearth in which they could not have possibly done anything wrong on your sin \nscale. But they are doomed to an eternity in hell for not repenting. Only a \ncruel, sadistic, fucking asshole of a creator would ever create something \nwhere that set of circumstances could arise. Definitely not a moral \nindividual anyway. And maybe I'm not a good spokesperson for all people. \nWhatever that was supposed to mean. But then again, that's not a claim I \never made anyway. But I'll make a claim now. You're a very cold hearted \nperson. I may be too. But I'm not claiming moral high ground either.

You can read that part of my book \"Born In A \nWar Between Dark And Light\" for free through Amazon's look feature. So I \nwill let that talk for itself.\n\nAnd then again, here you go blaming God once more for the evil of men. You \nmistake that God lets man prove who he is, whether a child of light or a \nchild of darkness, by allowing him free will. In that free will, people do \ngreat wickedness, genocide, rape, abusing women, all those things you want \nto heap on God. Believe me, that evil God has a super just system where \nsuch people will get their due reward in a kind of punishment that is \nincredible so no man really ever truly 'gets away with it.\"\n\nAnd then, here you go again, basing one time you 'flat-lined' as proof. \nWell, let me tell you, I too had surgery with bad experience and I \nexperienced a big fat nothing. Total darkness, nothing, no recollection, no \nangels, so so nothing. But unlike you, I did not find that one isolated \nincident as proof God did not exist. I instead saw it as it was not my time \nto go, and so it was a nothing experience, even though to men it looked \nlike I was gone. After all, in reality you did not ultimately die, did you \nJosh?  You are typing to me today, so that means it was indeed not your \ntime, as it was indeed not my time then, so our meeting the Maker hour was \nnot set.\n\nSince I have had experiences with God and demon which was as real as \nmeeting you in person, that superceded my nothing experience and I just \nshrugged it off to not my time to really go. So here we have an example \nbetween two people, which is you and I, one seeing the glass half empty \nanother seeing the same glass half full.\n\nJust because you or I or anyone else is on life support doesn't meet \nanything that we can recollect in that experience, doesn't prove or \ndisprove a thing concerning the reality of God.  My husband was on life \nsupport for weeks and didn't have any such experience, as he did not die \nduring that time.  On top of that, any such life support or hospital \ndeath/revive experience I would be suspect of because of all the drugs \nbeing pumped into a person as I am somewhat of Burpo's experience as I \nmentioned before due to circumstances even though what he experienced does \ngel with the Bible so I support it all the same.\n\nMy experiences in waking reality did not involve drugs or any questionable \nmind state and was real and in some seen by others with me in real \ndaylight.  What is really another irony with you Josh, is my experiences \nwere real, live, in front of my face and if one of those I had with another \nperson witnessing also, in front of both of our faces, in broad daylight, \nas real as a physical person in front of us. Now that's as real as it gets.\n\nBut your claim of 'tangible' proof, and this one you give for radiation, \nround world, again is not one you personally experienced in front of your \nface, but 2nd hand reports. Yet it is convenient for you to elevate your \njudgment of those reports to tangible. Sorry, guy, that is weak compared to \nmy firsthand personal experiences. Yet I know you will remain stubborn to \nyour side of things. But your stubborness will not denegrate or change or \ndismiss the reality of what I have experienced that is not of this world, \nbut supernatural that has the power to manifest in the natural.\n\nContrary to what you claim, even with such experiences, it has not and will \nnot garner credibility from the world, nor some kind of scientific prize or \nrecognition that you would recognize, because people still stay \nhard-hearted and reject just like you that which is too incredible for them \nto believe if they do not see it for themselves.\n\nTo this I bring to mind another Bible example which is doubting Thomas, a \nguy who even hung around with Jesus, still stayed stubborn himself until he \nhad his own experience, and then he was ashamed in that disbelief (not that \nI am saying anything to you about shame), and Jesus said the real blessed \nare those who believe without needing to see.\n\nSo if even a close apostle was a doubter, it is the nature of many men to \ndoubt unless they see for themselves. Unfortunately, that luxury will/is \nnot extended to many people and it falls on their own shoulders to have \nfaith in order to be saved. Hey, this is not my system I created to make it \nto heaven, this is the system of Jesus and God, and like all I just have to \nreport the truth of the way there.\n\nFrankly, Josh, I don't care if you do or don't believe me, as I you are a \ndyed-in-the-wool doubting Thomas, but again, for better or worse, I can say \nyour attitude won't change what happened to me. I do admit I am concerned \nabout what you will encounter when it is your official time to go, as I am \nfor anybody on this planet because hell is too fierce for any person, and \nif that offends you, then you have to wonder why you are so defensive to \nwhat makes another person feel compassion even if you don't share their \nbelief system.\n\nBut I do have to end that you are wrong speaking for all people that people \ndo not want my warnings, even this film by Burpo proves you wrong on that \nbecause plenty of people have wanted to hear his full message including the \npart where God says only those with Jesus in their hearts will make it to \nheaven. That warning and others like it that warn against missing heaven, \nas the popularity of this movie, and the flockers and posters to related \ninterviews with Burpos on what God told the boy, shows there are droves of \npeople interested in hearing. Even youtube itself shows with the popularity \nof such like videos giving such warnings that hell is real & the risk \ngetting there is real.

I'm not \ngonna go seek God. Don't you think people are capable of trying to find \nreasons to believe, only to realize it's all a fallacy? Speaking of \nfallacies, you used several on your rebuttal there. Do I really have to \npoint them out to you? I'm sure you know what they are. Yes I believe the \nearth is round and the oceans deep and that radiation is deadly. This \nbecause I've seen tangible evidence. That's the key. If anyone were to \nprovide actual tangible, not interpreted or perceived, proof of this gods \nexistence, I'd obviously change my mind in a second. Then there would be a \nreason to believe. See, all the aforementioned things have been made clear \nby people who made them clear for us without a doubt. For this they've won \nNobel prizes. Just as I'm more than positive that if you had actual \nevidence to a creators existence, you'd be awarded the same great honor. \nAnyone would granted they were able to provide one scrap of real proof that \nit were true. I don't have to have evidence to disprove god. That's absurd. \nNot believing is simply the default position. On that and on any other \nstance regarding others claims. I'm not postulating that no god exists and \nI know it for fact. That's insane. Nobody knows. There could be a vast \nvariety of potential gods thay may present themselves. But I've come to the \nconclusion that the one western civilization has been spoon fed for \ncenturies isn't the real Mccoy. Besides, even if he was, he's not exactly \nthe beacon of morality. Rape, genocide, infanticide, blood sacrifice, human \nsacrifice, slavery, the overall denigration of women. Not the type I'd \nwanna sign my name to worshipping. And yes it is you making the threats. \nYou probably get a kick outta telling me where you think I'm gonna go after \nI die. I don't care what they do with me when I die though. b You know why? \nCuz I'll be fucking dead. You had the option of leaving out grim details \nbut you chose to include them. Dark. And no my juxtaposition isn't one with \nany faith I'm afraid. You're wrong about that. It requires no faith at all \nto conclude what I have concluded. Just a lot of thought and research. As \nfar as solid proof of my flat lining. I have none other than medical \nrecords at Harborview and children's hospital in Seattle. I was pronounced \ndead at one point as I hadn't taken a breath for some time after being \ntaken off the life support machine. But when I came to I didn't come to \nafter a vision and then attempt to build a faux story behind it in order \nfor my parents to get financial gain from my plight. Lemme give ya a hint. \nPeople don't want your warnings. Because they're empty. They warn of a time \nthat will never be reached I believe you that you've probably gone through \na great deal of strife in your life. So has everybody. I just don't believe \nthe supernatural claims. Even if I wanted to, I can't change how I feel \nabout it or whether I believe or not. That's a product of the info you have \nand the common sense one has to use in assessing the info.

A real Christian does not \nkowtow to political correctness in order to please the world because he/she \nknows to do so makes them an enemy of God---so that was a compromised \nChristian in that rumor you heard, which is one who wears the badge of the \nname of Jesus only, but does not walk the walk.\n\nSo I am glad I met the test of a true Christian and stayed true to say the \ntruth, even if it falls flat with popularity, and brought a smile to your \nface to meeting your expected stereotype.\n\nIf only that smile parted a way for light into your inner darkness then I \nwould be smiling as well, not liking the idea now of a fine person as \nyourself yet another one led to inescapable deception.\n\nAny rate, the threats as you perceive them are not mine, I have no power \nover your destiny. I can only try to extend a hand, offer a warning shout. \nAnd, for better or worse, I am no magician or expert at sleight of hand \ntricks. If the truth seems like tricks to you, well unfortunately that \njives with what the Bible says about those perishing.\n\nWell, you can tag the word 'silly' to everything you want and it still \ndoesn't change the validity of my experiences and what I wrote. Now who is \nthe one pulling tricks here attempting to demean something as my book by \nlabeling it with repeat derogatory word as 'silly' and 'little'. So caught, \nJosh, in your own accusation.\n\nPlaying with you a little bit so you don't have to get all worked up here, \nbut just holding the mirror up to you where appropriate so you can find \nyourself the one pulling the very kind of tricks you say I am pulling.\n\nOh, Josh, I have evidence. I have recordings, I have photos, I have \nwitnesses, I have a paper trail, all going back years. Just because you are \nnot privy to it doesn't make it not so.\n\nWell, Josh, why don't you disbelieve the world is round? You have seen \npictures of it, but you haven't actually been at a point of outer space to \nverify it. Why don't you disbelieve that radiation is deadly? You have seen \npictures and read of its deadliness, yet you, yourself, have never live \nseen it happen or felt it to be deadly personally.\n\nBecause I am sure you believe radiation is deadly, and that the ocean is \nmiles deep, and the world is round without having personally witnessed this \nyourself, I can see you are capable of believing by report of pictures and \nwritten word, and testimony of others, of the realities of some things.\n\nAre you going to make yourself a spectacle by scoffing at such reports and \ndisbelieving them until they 'prove it to you' personally? If you did, you \nwould be considered a difficult fool, too foolish for his own good.\n\nWhy it may be in the minority you have been exposed to such reports as \nmine, it doesn't lessen their reality.  I would tell you to challenge God \nto prove himself to you, but I am afraid with your spiritual unreadiness \nyou might let in the devil instead. So as the disclaimer goes on some stunt \nprograms, 'kids, don't try this at home.\"\n\nUnlike you are trying to claim: Josh, your lack of belief is in a way faith \nbased, because you don't have any tangible evidence to disprove God. You \nare basing your 'evidence' on writings. You are accepting part of those \nwritings as solid evidence, you, Josh, a man who just gave me an argument \nhow anyone can write anything and it does not prove anything.\n\nSo how can you, Josh, tell me that you are making such a serious belief \ncall there is no God based on what you perceive as a conflict and clash \nfrom a collection of writings called the Bible? Ah, what an irony, Josh!\n\nFrankly, Josh, that is illogical reasoning. Now, if you had solid proof \nthat you flatlined at the same time two others in the same place did, and \nhad medical evidence of a flat lining you and the others, and had total \nrecall and found yourself in a void and saw those two others with you, and \nall of you were met with evidence convincing evidence of no God, and when \nall recovered all three of you had the same experience to report, then that \nwould make more sense along your line of reasoning of believable evidence. \n\nBut to say it is on a conflict from writings you don't even give an ounce \nof credence to in the first place, which is the Bible, is well, Josh, a \nkind of faith system, because it is on what you believe based on those \nseeming conflicts and not on hard real-world evidence, as I am talking I \nhave had.\n\nSo, no, your reasons for disbelieving in God are not tangible as mine, but \nfaith based, but not on a Christian faith but on your system of belief, \nwhich is one of rationalism, not evidence, but rationalism.\n\nNow, I want to ask you, Josh, what is more despicable: for a person to keep \ntheir mouth shut who knew there was a covered pit in the road with a lion \nin it and not warn a kid walking on that path? Or to explain in detail to \nthat kid about the real danger?\n\nSo despicable to me is to keep quiet to children concerning conduct that \nleads to hell, just not to upset the kid. I would be no friend, I would be \nno guardian, if I did not warn. Having encountered demons, Josh, I cannot \nkeep my mouth from warning. It is like knowing there is a dangerous gang \ndown a certain path that delights in brutal assaults to victims they get, \nand keeping my mouth shut about it. So cannot happen, whether the hearer \nbelieves, or is insulted or whatever.\n\nAny rate, once I had a period of time in my life when I was an atheist and \nbelieved only in science. I scoffed like you and elevated the reasoning of \nman. But God encounters and devil encounters will change anyone."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA", "inappropriate_score": 0.13351134846461948, "authorDisplayName": "Phunny Munny", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mghvjbv2lhfik522kcdhbjoe5djkj204", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-10T02:20:44.178Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.45724199999999998, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-10T02:20:44.178Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1hzIBltc400/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFlM/64-jSWGvrkU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113605539482073704610", "textDisplay": "+Vivian Gendernalik lol. Well how Christian of you to open and close your \ncomment with threats of eternal damnation and irrevocable death due to sin. \nThought I heard the rumor that Christians acted differently. Oh no, that's \nright. They just claim to act differently while hoisting themselves into \npedestals. Much like you've done. You can spare me your empty threats of \nhell, and your inclusion bible verses as well. Your trickery won't work on \nme unfortunately. You'll have to pardon me for not believing you regarding \nyour supposed encounters with God. It's real easy to make these claims, and \neven to write a silly little book about what you're selling. But it's \nrather convenient that you're unable to produce any evidence for these \nhappenings. Ya I know you said you caught it all with your camera. I don't \nreally buy that either. Example: hey, I'm actually Jim Morrison \nreincarnated. I know this Cuz I've recorded on my camera moments in the \nmirror in which he has appeared and told me only things that he and I would \nknow. See how easy that was? I spoke of proof but didn't have to really \nhave any. I don't know what you would purport that I was posturing about. I \nmade no extraordinarily claim. I merely called these liars out for what is \nclearly a money grab at the expense of others' submission to ridiculous \nindoctrination. I'm tired of people getting away with unspeakable acts, \ngenerally thinking they are better people, and God pushers which attack and \ntry to persuade little kids that your god is real. And if you don't believe \nthen you're going to burn. What a terrible thing to say to children. \nAbsolutely despicable. So in closing, good for you for thinking that you \npersonally know God or whatever. But I'm rather partial to the exact \nopposite regarding the existence of a creator. I have many reasons. \nProbably just as many as you for your faith. Only mine aren't faith based. \nThey're tangible. And when coupled with the contradictions in the bible, \nI'm led to the realization that the whole god thing is a farce.

Posturing is an attitude based on feelings, not \nfacts.\n\nThat is an easily assumed attitude of your own when you have lived devoid \nof any confirmation of Bible truths. However, since I know the Bible is \ntotally true, not just out of faith belief, but from a lifetime of having \nactual experiences, God encounters, Demon encounters, not just by myself, \nnot while asleep, or on drugs, or in a near death experience, or brain \ninjury or the half a dozen other reasons people can sigh to themselves in a \nfalsehood of assurance they have nothing to worry about living their lives \ncarefree without a God or Jesus or judgment they can hold in their fantasy \nas make-believe, when I speak it is not from posturing, but from actual \nexperience these Scriptures are indeed true.\n\nI guess I don't have that kind of luxury as you to scoff at anything \nBiblical having reality, having encountered God who showed me why he was \ngoing to be fully justified destroying millions of people deluded they were \nokay when they were in his eyes children of evil from lives of sins they \nhad no idea they were in. \n\nLet me see, I have photographed, audio recorded, had joint witnesses in \nbroad daylight to many of these experiences over many years, some published \nin Fate magazine, some others in my book \"Born In A War Between Dark and \nLight,\" so I, Josh Ruble, don't have the ability to bury my head in the \nsand like you and believe in the mindset of man to denounce it as belief in \na fairy tale.  You are reasoning as a man, but the Bible has a word for you \non that in Proverbs:\n\n\"There is a way which seems right to a man, But its end is the way of \ndeath.\"  Proverbs 14: 12\n\nBut I don't expect to convince you as I know, by the Bible also that \"For \nthe message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to \nus who are being saved it is the power of God.\" 1 Cor 1: 18\n\nSo me posturing? No. But I do daresay that you posturing? Yes.  And at a \ngreat risk to your eternal soul. Hell ain't no place for any human and not \nto be taken lightly, because, I can tell you, from personal experiences, \nand I have fresh audio I got on my Olympus digital recorder a few weeks \nago, not on some kind of Psychic wave machine that is dubious recorded \nstuff, but a regular little recorder, demons recorded. Oh, and some recent \npictures, that just recent stuff, as my experiences go back over 50 years. \nNot just limited to recorded/electronic stuff but real encounters everyone \ncan hear and see. Hope you are able to get an attitude change before that \nday of wrath comes, but if your conscience is seared, then I know you won't."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Phunny Munny", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mghvjbv2lhfik522kcdhbjoe5djkj204", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-09T18:32:50.585Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4JD2qnFMpQfETXRDfLucxA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.59545399999999993, "formal_score": 18, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-09T18:32:50.585Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1hzIBltc400/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFlM/64-jSWGvrkU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113605539482073704610", "textDisplay": "+joseph Kevnu this is not a good point.  its posturing in effort to not \nfeel like an idiot for believing in a fairy tale for her whole life.

That is where my experiences are at: a few have been caught on \nrecordings, photographed, left behind tangible realworld evidence that \nstays, etc. So, sure, imaginary friends type of things can be doubtful, but \nthen again, you might not have experienced imaginary friends; they might \nhave been supernatural and of a kind to plant a seed in you to lead you \nastray somewhere later in your life because we are in a spiritual warfare.\n\nThe latest evidence I had was just this last October where I got on my \nOlympus digital recorder using AAA batteries demonic problems I was having \nthat I did so just for my local pastor to hear to get additional help in \nthe spiritual problem. I still have the core recording but I destroyed the \nCDs I made so it wouldn't fall into the hands of unprepared people and they \nopen doors they can't handle.\n\nI have photographs, etc, not to mention unlike you I was not having \nchildhood imaginary friend and alone, but in some of these events, as an \nadult, with another adult, both of us having exact same experience in \ndaylight. In fact recollecting one back when I was in college in the 70s, \nwhen my roommate and I saw what we did, we were convinced the party we were \nseeing just feet away from us waving a flag of truce with their arm from \nour kitchen, was a real person that had broken in. There was no place for \nthat person to go as the kitchen a few feet from us and in our sight and no \nexit. Angry we went to the kitchen thinking it was my boyfriend at the time \nand found no one. Stuff like that. Our brains couldn't believe it because \nwhen you have such stuff it is mind- blowing, so we stupidly opened \ncabinets and dishwasher sure to find this person crammed in, but nope.\n\nI have had dozens and dozens of things like this, and more powerful because \nsome have been photographed and recorded stuff going back to the 70s all \nthe way to this year, so very very long history getting such phenomenon on \ncredible tools, before computer days and computer days of now.  And I am \nnot even touching the stuff I did have as a kid which resulted in visible \nphenomenon with others in daylight. So imaginary friend situation \noveractive imagination, perhaps in your case, but not the ones I am \nreferencing.\n\nI, too, was into philosophical Taoist over 35 years ago. It is like I did \nyour experience in reverse. I did the Tao Te Ching. Was really into all \nthis stuff, moved to keep notebooks of all my metaphysical journeying. I \nalso got into  Kaballah when I was married to a guy who was into Pagan no \ndoubt more extreme than you because he had gone as far as to make his own \nreligion out of it when he was in Berkeley, California. He was an admirer \nof Aleister Crowley, who you must know if you have explored the \nmetaphysical subjects in your spiritual searching.\n\nThat is when, to my surprise, I got into the bad demon experiences and \nbegan confrontations with actual demons because what this guy was \nattracting from his pagan practices was not the good forces he had thought \nhe had control over.  I even had a period where I was atheist, but God \nencounters, demon encounters that can be captured on film same thing being \nseen, caught on digital recorders same things being heard so you know you \nare not imagining this and it is not a cause of you've gone nuts or \nhallucinations, will make a believer out of anybody who has them. Because I \nended up having demon encounters over the next 35 years that showed me the \nChristian Bible stuff is true, that is why I ditched all that occult \nmetaphysical stuff as God refined me more and more on the truth.\n\nThough my use of the word delusion may have offended you, it is not too \nstrong of a word especially when it describes a deception that has such \nwicked consequences if the party doesn't snap out it. Why am I going to \nwater-down a serious problem to you that you have bought into a certain \ndeception that has you thinking the higher power road is a human choice \nthing and the Christianity thing is just another one. Yeah, I am sure you \nare loving your worldly-upheld spiritual standing just where the prince of \nthe world wants you to be until it is too late. And I am speaking from a \nvantage point of verifiable experiences. It is all about freewill, all \nright, so we show our true colors and get either destiniation 1 or \ndestination 2, no other in-between destination.\n\nYou know, I am not a 7th day adventist, but you ought to read Rogner \nMorneau \"A Trip Into The Supernatural' who had some interesting first \nperson experiences similar to some I have had. He is no longer alive, but I \nthink his personal interview can be seen on youtube in various parts. \nAgain, I do not in any way support the 7th day adventist aspect, in fact I \nthink he fell for a principality trick on getting into that, but that is \nanother story.  I am suggesting him because as myself there are a lot of \nother people who have had pronounced supernatural encounters that most \ndefinitely blow the mind because it is real world stuff. In fact I give \nexample of his book in my own book where I write a chapter touching how \nthere does exist scientific evidence supporting God's existence. \nUnfortunately the attitude in this world is when someone embraces a \nmetaphysical philosophy over their former Christianity that they have wised \nup, but from my experiences, they have dumbed down and gotten into the grip \nof an enemy deception."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRIVGo95vHQiKEWrznTN5Qg", "inappropriate_score": 0.10235414534288639, "authorDisplayName": "vorpal22", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z123z3ez0zbluj33n233wbb4clv1idxvu", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-14T04:49:18.644Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRIVGo95vHQiKEWrznTN5Qg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.17825599999999997, "formal_score": 69, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-14T04:50:41.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oO-_HbUd2BU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACo/tixY9CJKiNk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109921307822765862738", "textDisplay": "+Vivian Gendernalik The human brain, emotion, and senses are not \nparticularly reliable indicators of objective truth, which is why science \nhas far higher standards than simple untestable, unrepeatable, unverifiable \nhuman observation for evidence. I absolutely believe that you think you had \nthese experiences and that you may well have had these experiences, but it \nin no way supports the existence of any of these things. When I was a kid, \nI had three imaginary friends: a skeleton, a witch, and a ghost. And \nbelieve me when I tell you that I actually SAW these three with my own eyes \nand interacted with them in meaningful and interesting ways. I think we can \nboth agree that this was simply imagination, and I have no reason to \nbelieve any differently of your experiences.\n\nAlso, I was a Christian for 22 years, and then a Pagan for around three \nyears, and now finally an atheist / philosophical Taoist (12 years), and \nI've had \"religious experiences\" as all three, all unique and all just as \ninteresting under all three umbrellas of identification. They are quite \nfascinating, but again, I don't think they're evidence of much other than \nthe power of human imagination and certainly not indicators of any truths \nregarding objective reality. I can tell you that my experiences as a \nphilosophical Taoist have been far more profound in their content and \nability to adequately explain the nature of reality, and far more \nconsistent with modern cosmology and physics than those I had as a \nChristian or Pagan, but I'd hardly expect you to suddenly grant them \nobjective validity and consider becoming a philosophical Taoist. I can \nguarantee you that I am not alone in my experiences either: when I stumbled \nacross the Tao Te Ching and read it, it was eerily like someone had ripped \nopen my head, extricated my experiences and thoughts, and transcribed them \nfar more neatly, eloquently, concisely, and with more wisdom than I would \never have been able to do.\n\nAnd certainly, your religious choices have no impact on me, either. I agree \nwith you that the world is filled with people having \"religious \nexperiences\", but as they're all different and largely culture- and \nreligion-dependent, again, I'll state that there's no reason to assert any \nof these extremely diverse and divergent worldviews as truth and these \nexperiences may well be nothing more than an unusual function of the human \nbrain like dreaming and sleep paralysis are. Indeed, I believe that it's \npossible to reliably trigger these experiences in many people by inducing \nelectrical storms in the temporal lobes.\n\nWhere did I say that this world is all there is? I can't possibly know \nthat. I do know, however, that the god of the bible most certainly does not \nexist, nor do the silly concepts of heaven and hell. Good luck with those \ndelusions.

Hmmm.)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEqI76fgtJ4J0kpbYj3DDCw", "inappropriate_score": 0.1834862385321101, "authorDisplayName": "Vivian Gendernalik", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z123z3ez0zbluj33n233wbb4clv1idxvu", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-14T04:13:37.804Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEqI76fgtJ4J0kpbYj3DDCw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.15470800000000001, "formal_score": 31, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-14T04:13:37.804Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oPgqRsrbAUU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEc/3cnWcmN_Y-0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106553178831706431676", "textDisplay": "+vorpal22 well Nick Marley may not have anything more than the Bible to \ngive as evidence of heaven and hell, which is more than good enough as it \nrelates verifiable accounts going back to Hebrew roots but I have much more \nevidence than your invented Candyland that confirms these Bible-taught \nreality.\n\nI have personally had experiences with God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, demons, \nrulers of principalities, some by myself alone, some with other people \nhaving the same joint experience, all of them fully awake.

Also, I'd like to see an account like this, \nof an Atheist. It's always Christians, who have visions of Heaven. \nChristians would argue, it's because of their lack of faith, but still, the \nfact remains, it's only people who know enough about Christianity, who are \nable to recognize something as \"Jesus\" or \"Heaven\". When you've been taught \nto believe something, that belief can be strong enough to where you truly \nbelieve it on not just a \"faith\" level. Of course, he saw Jesus and Heaven, \nit's embedded in his subconscious and conscious mind to believe in them. He \nonly met people he knows of, whether he consciously remembers them being \ntalked about, or he heard his parents discussing his deceased relatives and \nhis subconscious mind stored that information. I've noticed a pattern to \nthis guy's tale, and that is, he's very very cautious of how much \ninformation he releases per question. He says enough to answer the \nquestion, and nothing extra. He said he went to Heaven, and everyone is in \ntheir prime, so how would he be able to recognize an young age 20 year old \nGod, or an age 20 year old Jesus? He claims he talked with Jesus, but yet, \ncan't remember anything they talked about, so how can he be certain he \ntalked with Jesus at all? God told Jesus, hey teach him a few things, and \nthen once he's back, and I'll make it so he doesn't remember. Logically \nspeaking, that's not useful. He is also states \"God is huge\", which implies \nGod is a form, or a some-thing, but yet, can't describe the nature of this \n\"huge-ness\". If God was \"huge\", then he was present and he existed (being), \nso that implies \"God was present, and he was huge\", he then says \"God is \nbig enough to fit the whole world in his hand\", which implies he had \nfurther knowledge of the song \"He's got the whole world in his hand\", which \nmost kids learn. He uses that statement, as if he observed God holding the \nworld in his hand, and not as if he heard a Pastor use it as a metaphor for \nGod's greatness prior to the incident. The one thing he needs to describe \nand explain, he for some conveniently can't describe, which panders to the \nidea of God, but at the same time, how was he able to visually observe and \nhave this experience, if his brain wasn't present? It implies, there was \nthe brain on the physical realm, and a spiritual brain on the Heaven realm, \nso which one does he have now? He claims, he visually saw God, so his human \nbrain was able to make some form of heads or tails of what he seen, but \nyet, even tho it's stored in his brain as an actual experience, he can't \ndescribe it. In other words, his brain was able to describe the experience \nto him and his brain told him it was God, but yet, the same brain that \nstored the experience, fails to describe and recall the experience? \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12cfxaarqjsg1aas04cd35phrjfx5mxioc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjcWQzcWQpkL2FO15tXvvFw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EaA1Br4-91M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABGY/O2A74oJlhFo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Blake Grice", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-28T17:14:25.018Z", "videoId": "lawiKeRUiK8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjcWQzcWQpkL2FO15tXvvFw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.064297999999999966, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-04-28T17:14:25.018Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114633798524554360165", "textDisplay": "Dimethyltriptamine releases in large amounts at the time of death or near \ndeath\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z122fvtgdvedsz1xl04cexiwlpzmt51bf20": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtJ9fq8N6X3eHgonUHA_yYw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TvjXajNCpmo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABM8/LhPSJwamx3k/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.7467248908296944, "authorDisplayName": "Drew Kittson", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-02T07:55:15.301Z", "videoId": "lawiKeRUiK8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCtJ9fq8N6X3eHgonUHA_yYw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.67242200000000008, "formal_score": 5, "updatedAt": "2014-06-02T07:55:15.301Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103495835843681572210", "textDisplay": "A bunch of \"adult\" children who think the universe revolves around their \nsilly lives.

A sword is a man-made instrument used to \ndefend against or do battle with other human beings in a material world.

But Colton also said that God was \nso HUGE, that he could \"fit the whole world in his hands\". The world's \n(planet Earth) circumference is about 8,000 miles... this would suggest \nthat God's hands must measure about 8,000 miles across the palm, so God \nmust be about 140,000 miles tall (more than half the distance from earth to \nthe moon). \n\nHard to figure out how God could be seated in a huge throne room with Jesus \nseated on his right and Gabriel seated on his left, if Jesus and Gabriel \nare \"normal\" human height, say 5'10\"; remember that Colton Burpo said Jesus \nis \"actually your size\" and you can walk and talk with him. How could God, \nJesus and Gabriel be seated together? \n\n\nIf God is so big he can fit the world in his hands, how big must the huge \nthrone room be? Perhaps about 300,000 miles high, 600,000 miles wide and \n1,200,000 miles long? That equates to a room 12'6\" high, 25' wide and 50' \nlong scaled down for us normal-sized humans.

I believe that would be a small child \nsuddenly mentioning a baby sister he had never previously known about.  \nWhen I was in a car accident that the police officer said should have taken \nour lives... he said he did not expect anyone to be alive when he arrived \non the scene...  My car had rolled upside down and gone headlong into \noncoming traffic and a pickup truck went up on top of the car... nothing in \nthat front seat survived, but I.  Thankfully my children were in the back \nseat.\n\nAnyway my four year old was, months later able to relate that accident to \nme in very minute detail.  I had been unconscious but she experienced every \nmoment as if in slow motion and described everything in detail... \nverifiable by the police reports.  She described the truck going up on top \nof us, the roof coming down on 'mommy's' head, the people that came but \ncouldn't figure out how to get her 1 1/2 year old brother out of his car \nseat, and so they took the whole car seat out of the window, and then she \nhelped unbuckle him...  she told me how she and her brother laughed because \n\"mommy was too long for the stretcher and her feet hung off when they were \nputting her into the helicopter...  never discount the vivid memories of \nchildren...\n\nOne of the things she told me was; \"Mommy, when they were taking you away \nin the helicopter I saw an angel.\"  I was not one who had ever promoted or \nspoken much of angels to my children.  But I never probed her for further \ndetails.  I do however believe she saw an angel because they had to have \nbeen with us that day.  I came home from the hospital that same day with no \nconcussion (though I do have lost memories) and one broken bone.  I fully \nbelieve God healed my legs as I lay in the hospital.  I walked out on both \nlegs.  My children suffered no more than minor abrasions from their \nrestraining belts.  Yes, I do believe that children are much more open to \nreceive the things of God.
