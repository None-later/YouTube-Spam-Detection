Please don't take this personally. \n\nThe US debt as it stands now, they can barely keep up with the interest \npayments, let alone try to bring it back down. They have no intention of \npaying it off and hence no plan to. For so long they haven't needed to \nsince being tied to the oil, as in all oil in the world was sold in US $ \nthat meant the value of those dollars became the only western currency to \nbe tied to a commodity. Ironic because the US was the frist to break from \nthe gold standard back in the 70's and the rest of us followed suit, not \nrealising that the US had pegged it's currency to another commodity. \nShortly after that the UK tried to devalue it's currency which was then the \nsterling, or silver, and basically went into a massive depression. \n\nJust realising how much there is to explain, so I'm gonna cut it short for \nnow. The US dollar will go on and the FED will print money at will up to \nthe point where it is no longer the global reserve currency. But the wheels \nhave been turning for a long time and already the BRICS have set themselves \nup to take over once the US$ folds. All of the wars in the middle east have \nbeen to keep countries on the dollar, and the sancations on Iran and the \nattack on Lybia and Syria. It all goes back to the dollar being the world \nreserve currency. But now most of the big players are already floating the \ndollar in favour of gold or similar assets to back up their own currencies. \nRussia traded off all of its dollar reserves, as is China at the moment. \nSaudia Arabia threatened to dump $750US Billion all at once which would \nhave taken the dollar out in one go 2 or 3 weeks ago. Really they should \nhave, just to get something for it because very soon it will become \nworthless. Firstly the oil will be traded in Yaun or Rubble via Syria and \nIran who can well undersell the frakers. Second already many countries are \nrefusing to take US currency where once it was accepoted universally. If \nyou remember growth and decay graphs from maths class in school you will \nknow how it will go. A little at first then quickly picking up pace. \n\n\nWell skimmed over so much but thats a brief glimpse of whats about to \nhappen. Either this year or next. There is only 1 more round of potential \nbailouts to go, that being by the IMF if they choose to do so, then we move \non to what some are calling the Big Reset.

However, it is accurate to say that \nthe Bible never, never accepts homosexuality as a legitimate lifestyle. Nor \ndoes it ever accept heterosexual relationships outside marriage as \nlegitimate, nor does it ever condone abusive relationships within marriage. \nBut a person who does not accept Biblical authority cannot be expected to \nlive up to Biblical precepts! Even believers often fail to do that, and yet \ntheir faith may be no less sincere for this; but they would normally regret \ntheir sins, whereas many unbelievers might not perceive those actions \n(especially as regards satisfying one's erotic desires) as sinful at all. \nJust think, adultery is no longer considered a crime; it might ruin the \nkids' life for a time, but as far as the law is concerned it is just a case \nof 'falling in love with someone else'. What is for a believer a deed done \nin righteousness might even be perceived by certain unbelievers as wicked, \nbecause Biblical standards have been turned upside down. The question for a \nman like Kasich, running for office, is NOT to legislate human behavior, \nbut to preserve social peace. Those who want to force an LGBT agenda upon \nthe entire public are seeking the opposite in that, for them, it does not \nmatter that extending their own freedom of action imperils others' liberty \nof conscience.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12jgrmbyzvcubwem23fcpy5ltzbdlo24": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDYwquYhHj-wwBySmH03XCA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2sVP9T3HJ8A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB4o/SwUXnltaJN0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Carol Young", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-04T12:46:44.806Z", "videoId": "vVnamdZK7xE", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDYwquYhHj-wwBySmH03XCA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.043808000000000014, "formal_score": 11, "updatedAt": "2016-05-04T12:46:44.806Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103659497212776673359", "textDisplay": "kasich this is not a run to pastor a church in order to collect tithing \nthis is politics take a stance on something. just tell the truth about how \nyou feel and stop trying to find the answer to appease everybody. go back \nto Ohio and govern.
