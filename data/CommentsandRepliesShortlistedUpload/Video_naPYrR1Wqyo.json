Conservatism and progressivism are \nright, respectively left ideologies that have that concern. And even that \nis not truly correct, because progressivism actually is a philosophy \nconcerned with technical and economical innovation whereas conservatism \nactually is a philosophy concerned with maintaining the status quo. \nHowever, just like the term liberalism, the terms of progressivism and \nconservatism are so commonly misused and misunderstood in the US that I \nadded them here.\n\nUltimately, the amount of government intervention has actually absolutely \nnothing to do with rightism or leftism, not even remotely. If all you \nbelieve in is less government, then you are neither left or right. You are \njust against government intervention and that's it.

And all your \"Facts\" are based on \nthis Bigoted belief.*\n\nNever said that. What I said was that your definition of rightism is wrong \nand that actual extreme rightism fulfills such criteria. I said said that \nwhat you erroneously consider rightism would fulfill such criteria.\n\n*Rightists want EVERYONE to be Successful and FREE. I don't doubt Leftists \nWant that too. The Difference is in the METHOD each thinks will achieve \nthat Goal.*\n\nSince your definition of rightism is just plain wrong, I can only answer to \nwhat you believe rightism to be. So tell me:\n\nWhat does that \"rightism\" of yours do to allow everybody to be successful? \nDo you want to change how public schools are funded, so that poorer \nneighborhoods get the same chance of a quality education as richer \nneighborhoods? And how exactly would you do that?\n\nAlso, what is freedom? Do you want the freedom to shoot your neighbor if he \nworks on Sundays? Or do you want the freedom to have sex with a minor? Do \nyou want the freedom that you can drive through town in your tank and have \na nuke in your backyard? What kind of freedom do you talk about?\n\nBecause that is where you are entirely wrong. Rightists and leftists do not \nhave the same goals. Rightists believe that things like mandatory health \ncare would impair their freedom whereas leftists would never get such a \nnonsense idea. Leftists want the freedom that comes from mandatory health \ncare, so that one doesn't have to pay for somebody else's surgery with my \ntax money while he chose to use the money for vacation instead of health \ninsurance. To rightists, illegal immigrants are parasites. To leftists, \npeople who abuse their freedom at the cost of society are parasites, \nwhether they are natives or illegal immigrants. The same applies to gun \ncontrol. If my neighbor wants to own a gun, I want him to undergo \nsufficient training to ensure that he does not accidentally shoot my dog. I \nwant the freedom to not be impaired by somebody else's freedom who cannot \nhandle it responsible.\n\nAnd that is the one thing where you are wrong as well. I don't believe that \npower corrupts or that people are evil. I believe that too many people are \nimmature and that includes the people on the street as well as those in \ngovernment. Both need to be controlled.\n\n*You prefer the BIGOTED Theory of Politics where Leftists are Morally \nSuperior because REGARDLESS of the RESULTS of their Govt Policies, the \nINTENT is out of LOVE for their fellow man, whereas, Rightists are \nmotivated by HATE and GREED. Good Grief.*\n\nI also never said that.\n\n*How can you not hear your own Bigotry ringing in your ears?*\n\nNo, because I never said that. I was talking about actual rightism, not \nthat nonsense that you made up. Rightism and leftism have absolutely \nnothing to do with the amount of power given to government. That is \ndetermined by the degree of conservatism."}}]}, "z13ucpmpezu0uhbmu22jx5qaiou3g3ke1": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCotbcl0oc8Cee9MaQ3u6-Rw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fsuAq42TpMw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/jVHXxZXohsA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "McGhostluvin", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-16T10:36:37.034Z", "videoId": "naPYrR1Wqyo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCotbcl0oc8Cee9MaQ3u6-Rw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.97406029999999999, "formal_score": 4, "updatedAt": "2014-12-16T10:36:37.034Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104537582714691635046", "textDisplay": "i can agree with what this guy is saying for the most part....but when he \nis trying to be funny he just sounds like a moron.  just stick to the facts \nbud...your not funny\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13qgbbwcrvhz1adz22rst0ygxmsj5ysf": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCREtQIuifoBXom8ajp9MT-w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 2.0408163265306123, "authorDisplayName": "davec3487", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-28T19:48:50.912Z", "videoId": "naPYrR1Wqyo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCREtQIuifoBXom8ajp9MT-w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.85951029999999995, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-12-28T19:48:50.912Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110870619833301575171", "textDisplay": "This guy is a liberal retard.

offers low interest loan. the bank now paying \nbetween .75 percent and .25 percent dont need depositors so the saving \ninterest gos down and the borrowing cost to people stays about the same. \nwith

"authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115064753213117025102", "textDisplay": "+tommy g You seem to be confusing corporate tax rates with capital gains. \n The maximum corporate tax rate if I remember off the top my head right is \n32% and the maximum and capital gains is 15%.  The effective corporate tax \nrate is some were in the teens but it's hard to figure out exactly where \nbecause corporations aren't required to disclose exactly how much in taxes \nthey are paying to any given government just beat overall amount of taxes \nthey paid.  This means that if they paid a higher tax rate in Germany that \nis lumped in with the disclosure even if they paid a much lower rate in the \nUS.\n\nCapital gains is only paid on the gains that were made off investment not \nthe entire investment.  Real investment like say starting a new business is \nactually tax deductible so they do not pay taxes on that money to begin \nwith.  To make matters worse it is a percent maximum and many these \nindividuals paid much lower rates for it is even possible for them to pay \neight in the single digits.\n\nI'm guessing your understanding of how the economy works based on the fact \nthat capital is the beginning of the system and not the end.  I will use \nthe Walton's to illustrate this fact.  This six of them last year will \nprobably be made around three billion dollars for owning shares in the \ncompany that their father started.  I think a couple them are on the board \nbut most of them have nothing to write the to do with the business.  In \nplain terms they did nothing last year to make Wal-Mart a single penny in \nwealth but received a reedy to this amount of money.\n\nTo better understand what I'm talking about I will explain how actual \nwealth is created in a society.  Real wealth is created when goods or \nservices are created or perform.  If you look at how baking finance and the \nstock market actually works a deeper understanding of what is actually \ngoing on in our country emerges.  I will begin with stocks because most \npeople see that as a positive and that a higher stock price is actually a \ngood thing.  If you are business and you issue stock in that business to \nraise money for let's say expansion or even just to start it you get that \nmoney once and only once unless you issue new stock.  From that day forward \nyou are responsible to pay out dividends to that stock.  The price of the \nstock only matters to the company when it needs to issue new stock.  The \nprice of the stock is set by the perception of the company or even just the \nperception of the stock itself but is not directly tied to anything about \nthe corporation.\n\nI have a theory that the entire reason why we have boomed bust cycles is \nbecause of excess capital.  In truth there is only so many productive \nthings that we can invest in and if you have to seek returns for your \ninvestments you have to invest that money even if it is just through a \nbank.  This actually causes a bid up process that artificially inflates \nmarketplaces.  This is that we can have a record high gas prices and a \nrecord high oversupply of oil at the same time.  Quantitative easing is \nartificially pumping up the capital in the system in efforts to prevent a \ndeflationary cycle.  Much of this money is going into commodities and other \nsimilar markets to including back into the debt market that they are buying \nderivatives now based on car loans and rental agreements creating an \nincentive for lenders to ignore potential risks.\n\nI've rattle on too long so I will cut here and look for to your laughable \nreply."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs5Ex95427y-ezOgala19kQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "tommy g", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12stf0j4ki0gr4rz04chrmozwjvi3j4phk", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-22T03:15:29.980Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCs5Ex95427y-ezOgala19kQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.69260199999999994, "formal_score": 74, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-22T03:15:29.980Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100341243665220676244", "textDisplay": "i didnt mean attacking the poor i mean the obsession of help the poor at \nall cost even if its a detriment to the rest of society\n\nno bill maher is not right hes saying lets leave out anyone we may be able \nto sway on a issue and just talk about how right you think you are to \npeople who agree with you no outside ideas allowed and thats retarded "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCrwdKgyeg-CPerxWf7vDQw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "chuckn char", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12stf0j4ki0gr4rz04chrmozwjvi3j4phk", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-22T01:27:36.386Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCrwdKgyeg-CPerxWf7vDQw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99652033000000007, "formal_score": 30, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-22T01:27:36.386Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101072688663976531573", "textDisplay": "Maher IS 100% right, period."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCid562sN7Blk1zQu98p2JWw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "randomflashbacks", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12stf0j4ki0gr4rz04chrmozwjvi3j4phk", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-22T01:20:26.308Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCid562sN7Blk1zQu98p2JWw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.87704000000000004, "formal_score": 65, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-22T01:20:26.308Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nGM-NvSaNKc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEo/YJHL8R-VoAY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105406834289875357509", "textDisplay": "\"One with religion and one with attacking the poor\" those are both the \nrepublicans actually.

A \ncouple months ago there was a hearing in Congress about Health Care and \nthey had an expert from Canada testify about their Health Care System. \n They explained that their system cost about half what ours does.  There \nwas a lot more information that was revealed during that hearing like the \nfact that in every measurable way their system performs much better than \nours.  This is not news to anybody who's actually looked at the world \nHealth Care Systems because we are ranked 19th if I remember right and even \nEngland with the British Health Care System beats us at 17th and Canada is \naround 5th.\n\nBut those horrible waiting lists that conservatives complain about our \nabout elective procedures so you won't be able to get your knee surgery \nnearly as fast.  Plus the only reason they exist is because Canada have as \nmany doctors as the U.S. does but they cover 100% of their population \neffectively where at best we're at 80%.  But there are a lot of doctors \nfleeing but not from Canada but to Canada from the U.S..  This is because \nit is a lot easier and cheaper to practice medicine.  This is because \ndoctors having to deal with insurance companies which is quite expensive. \n Often they have to hire additional personnel to handle insurance companies \ntrying not to pay out to maximize their profits.\n\nNow just to make fun of your argument here is my ridiculous take on your \nargument.\n\n$100 to go see a movie in the US practically nobody can afford that so they \nbuy insurance so they only have pay $50.00 to go see a movie plus $10.00 a \nmonth even if they don't see any movies and if they do see movies their \npremium will continuously go up to 20 or even $30.00 a month.\n\nIn Canada the government pays $10.00 for you to go see a movie and you can \ngo often as you want.\n\nYes this argument is complete be laughable and actually is nothing like how \nthe actual Healthcare Systems between our two countries are but I couldn't \nhelp myself and I hope you did not come up with that argument yourself."}}]}, "z12csbpxzxuis3f2t22ayp3xwm3jsnmf4": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3lNOEqlXKYgHGbxagRgSKQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "robert trost", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-22T22:04:16.997Z", "videoId": "naPYrR1Wqyo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3lNOEqlXKYgHGbxagRgSKQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.10945800000000006, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-22T22:04:16.997Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106693531751521553501", "textDisplay": "Democrats are cowards that always try to be the nice guy that finishes \nlast!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12aflng4lzuedrkn231dvfz2w3hsn2i204": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCexhLdFKG5KaCr8-IbAwLvQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mike M", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-01T17:10:34.314Z", "videoId": "naPYrR1Wqyo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCexhLdFKG5KaCr8-IbAwLvQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.23517000000000005, "formal_score": 33, "updatedAt": "2015-02-01T17:10:34.314Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115346894228393102538", "textDisplay": "Stewart tried to reach out to find moderates on the right, but he should \nknow.. there are no moderates left in the GOP.

Are convinced that \nliberals are evil and godless, which is synonymous to them, and B.) are \nfeeling backed into a corner regarding the LONG traditions that have \nsustained their worldviews, low these many years. The web is a fairly new \ntool for disseminating knowledge, worldwide. No longer can these cut-off \ncommunities maintain their mythologies. The coasts of the U.S. have \n\"infected\" them and their children with......FACTS, backed up by evidence. \nSo OF COURSE, they're sitting around cleaning their guns and stocking up \nfor Armageddon.It wasn't THAT long ago that Jim Crow laws were the norm in \nthe south.

If what you said was true, then the \ntheir share of the pie would remain the same or get larger.  But the fact \nis, the voters elected people who don't want that and it has shrunk.\n\nThe oil industry contributes a lot of money to congressional and senate \nelections.  If support of the oil industry is based upon being bought and \npaid for by the oil industry, why doesn't every politician support the oil \nindustry?  And get a lot of big campaign contributions.  Why doesn't every \npolitician vote for a bigger defense budget?  Wouldn't that get them more \nmoney?  Why isn't every politician in favor of \"BIG PHARMA\"?  Wouldn't that \nget them more money?  Or in favor of BIG LABOR?  Or BIG WHATEVER?  If all \npoliticians are bought and paid for, why aren't they all supporting the \nPOLITICIAN BUYERS of BIG WHATEVER?  \n\nYes, there's a lot of money in politics, but your belief that politics is \nbought and paid for is ridiculous and I just proved the absurdity of your \nbelief.\n\nAbout the the Maryland Governor, in fact he has a lot of power in Maryland \nif he uses it.  He has the power to veto legislation and budgets.  Yes, the \nlegislature can override his vetoes, but they do so at their own peril when \nthey face the voters.  The Governor also has the bully pulpit and can make \na case against an irresponsible legislature.

Although more campaign contribution \ndoes not insure getting elected, statisticly it is more probable.  The \nbought and paid for system I was referring to was the crafting of \nlegislation with the influence of millions of lobbyist dollars being paid \nto legislators on both sides of the isle.  In the 21st Century the power of \nlabor unions is miniscule compared to that of the Pharmacutical, Medical, \nEnergy, and Agricultural lobbies.  Of course the Military/Industrial \nComplex dwarfs them all.  You are looking at the system from one side of \nthe isle.  I am looking at it from a position of being detached from either \nside.\n\nCareer legislators are only going to vote in  a manner which ensures their \nown career survival.  They know that most of the time their constituancy is \ngoing to vote them back into office.  It is the Executive branches that are \nelectoral crapshoots.  A good example is Maryland in 2014.   When a \nDemocratic Governor(O'Malley) has enraged the the citizenry by his \ncorruption and arrogance, a Republican Governor is elected.  Making the \nRepublican Governor irrelevant is the fact that the citizens vote back the \nsame Democratic  Majority of legislators who control Annapolis.  Thus, the \nGovernor is impotent.  The voters have shown their disgust in a backlash \nvote, but it achieves nothing sunstantial.  O'Bama was elected in a \nbacklash vote twice, but it achieved nothing substantial, other than \ngridlock."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXYpxFgA0ZhNiEsT8kXsX6A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "M Taylor", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135ctcrmozqhxwbs04ch125apfzwhaz3m00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-09T13:32:07.847Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXYpxFgA0ZhNiEsT8kXsX6A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29049799999999998, "formal_score": 69, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-01-09T13:32:07.847Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116061264319241853554", "textDisplay": "Bought and paid for political system makes a nice sounding bumper sticker. \n But the truth is, the politicians are responding to what the voters want. \n The problem is that most voters don't know ANYTHING about politics, the \npoliticians, history or current events.

This Meme of the Obama Supermajority has been \nused in a disingenuous way to justify the unprecedented, obscene GOP \nabussal of the Filibuster under Obama.\n\nKyle makes a good point about the Filibuster.   In Jan 2001, the Senate was \ndivided 50 / 50 with Dick Cheney as the 51st Republican Senator.  Then \nSenator Jim Jeffords became an Independent and the GOP was no longer in the \nMajority.  But in 2009, indeed for most of Obama\u2019s Presidency, it has been \nassumed President Obama just needed 60 Senate votes to get anything done.  \n\nSo why didn\u2019t the Dems abuse the Filibuster under Bush, with their 50 \nSenators? (All you need are 41 to do a lot of damage.)  The Dems just don\u2019t \nhave the same \u201cFire In The Belly\u201d and hatred that the Grand Old Party \npossesses. \n\nIt shows that it is NOT the SIZE of the opposition, but how it USES its \nsize, that matters.  This is especially relevant when you are in the \nbusiness of screwing people.  \n\n\nTWO EXAMPLES:\nThe Republican-led Filibusters that killed the \u201cBring Jobs Home Act\u201d in \nJuly 2012 and July 2014.  The Bill would have repealed the Corp. Tax Break \nfor shipping Jobs and factories overseas.  YES, This was the SAME tax break \nthat Mitt Romney said he never heard of in the First Presidential Debate of \nOctober 2012.  It was too bad Obama was asleep during that Debate or he \ncould have told Mitt that the Tax Break did exist and was saved by a \nRepublican Filibuster. \n\n\nIn the October 2014 Kentucky Senatorial Debate on KEB_TV, Dem Challenger \nAlison Grimes referred to \u201cTax Breaks for shipping jobs overseas\u201d, AND LIKE \nOBAMA failed to mention the Filibuster on July 31, 2014, of Senate Bill \nS2569. \nMitch McConnell dismissed her with a \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking \nabout\u201d in his smooth-as-Southern-Comfort-Southern-Accent.\n\n\nMitch must have been proud of his performance that evening.  He could have\nlost the Debate on that issue and lost the chance to be Senate Majority \nLeader.\n\nIt\u2019s as if the Filibusters took place on a freaking Exosolar Planet."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRn-E0t5Q9aAX60vD_L8Svg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Trent Meade", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133wxbjetiwu5ix304ccfkw5knwfbuxbfs", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-19T08:41:14.287Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRn-E0t5Q9aAX60vD_L8Svg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.64668999999999999, "formal_score": 24, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-19T08:41:14.287Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109386954412087619314", "textDisplay": "+Britney Miller this is why there is no point to voting.

Saying you \ncan't negotiate with anybody that's a Republican is just closed minded and \ngets you nowhere. That said, I'm a Liberal generally speaking and I do \nthink we need to be more concrete in what we want and stand for. But that \ndoesn't mean that we can't EVER compromise on anything. It doesn't have to \nbe so black and white as you and Bill apparently think It needs to be.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12fsftalw2kifk2v23ujxzpbxu2i352i": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7fm_jRE5UaDk3DJEe139Ow", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xlhtuMmHoVU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/exiEJISwRH0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "bizarro7777", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-19T21:26:44.151Z", "videoId": "naPYrR1Wqyo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7fm_jRE5UaDk3DJEe139Ow"}, "sentiment_score": -0.76036999999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-11-19T21:26:44.151Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118244971990738702104", "textDisplay": "100% correct.

It \nwas the Republican economic policies that brought America to the very brink \nof economic melt down with their deregulation and a government hands off \nbig business that encouraged the, so called, American industrial base to be \ntransferred to Communist China, of all places, to maximize their profits at \nour expense. It has been the Republican dominated House of Congress that \nhas been the anchor of the American economic and social progress and have \nblocked every agenda of Obama to lift America out of the recession, and \njust to oppose Obama out of general Republican principles of \nanti-Americanism camouflaged with a lot of American flag waving, gun waving \nand bible thumping to appeal to all the right wingers with no real \nsubstance of their own but to oppose Obama.

The sooner that the American people wake up \nand get the Republicans out of our government, the better America will be.  \nHow was America before the Reagan administration and how was America by the \nend of the Bush administration.

You \nchecked out my toss-off YouTube account, declared yourself an expert, and \nthen went full retard.\n\nDid I make it as an artist? Sure. I've been published, and my art is on \ntitles you'd recognize. YOU'D call that success, but that was during my \nsell-out period working for Dick Giordano studios. I'm contractually \nforbidden from publishing those pieces and pages I worked on because of \nproprietary interests held by Warner.\nAnd somehow, you think that means....OH GOLLY NOEZ!... I'm not creative.\nSuit yourself. I've lived my life and continue to, as any artist \ndoes....unimpacted by the white noise of banal people.\n\nBut hey, that's all just me responding defensively to your perpetually \ninaccurate take on reality. An artist tries to occupy space outside \nhimself, so I thank you for your abstract take on verifiable reality.\n\nI work in a factory now, to make sure there's a steady paycheck. Having \nkids will do that to a long-haired traveling nomad artist who spent more \ntime smoking bongs and drawing really cool shit, and writing stories that \nmade people respond, than you would have the COURAGE to endure.\nI slept under bridges to keep my art dry when I was between freelance jobs. \nI spent money I didn't have to set up tables at conventions in the small \npress areas, next to the likes of Bruce Timm and Frank Miller back when \nTHEY were struggling for jobs, and we got high together, and split the bill \nthree ways for one all-you-can-eat buffet, while we tried to make a buck \nwith our doodles. I might know a thing or two about starving for my craft.\n\nWhich is why, when I sidelined much of that to be with my sons, to make \nsure they had the LUXURY at some point of choosing their own lives, and \ngave up the feel of brush pens and rapidographs for the calluses of bending \nhot plastic into consumer-bait for shitheads like you, I did it without \nlasting regret.\n\nAnd that doesn't make me a hero. It just makes me a man.\n\nSo, when I take on the mantle of adult responsibility, select good health \ncare for my kids, and work on my feet for 12 hour shifts 5 days a week in a \nfactory, past my 50th birthday, you can think all kinds of disappointing \nshit about me.

Well done.\nHad I simply amended it to \"Ivy League Schools\", you'd have nothing to say.\n\nHere are some facts, which left-leaning turds like yourself cannot grasp:\n1. Understanding that the leftist agenda is a recipe for failure does not \nmake someone a 'right-wing dude'. It simply makes them an adult.\n2. You completely skipped over the main point, which was your intention, \nbecause you have no response to it. Here it is again, parakeet: Obama and \nBush are two flavors of the same ice cream. Their policies for this country \ndiffer SO SLIGHTLY that there was no hiccup in the worst of them when these \ntransient officials changed offices.\n3. No matter how much 'better off' you seem to think 'dozens of countries' \nare with so-called 'universal health care', all you expose is that you're \nreading about them, and not actually seeing them first-hand.\n\nLet's get the terms straight, though, because 'universal' health care is a \nMYTH. What it is in every instance you try to name is 'nationalized' health \ncare. In some places, the coverage is pretty comprehensive, but the QUALITY \nis second and third rate. Go on, quote me a leftist blog, and I'll show you \nsimple facts.\nPeople die in those countries because the health care is INEFFECTIVE.\n\nClearly, you're a bad person. Here's why:\n\nYou have no clue who I am nor how or even IF I vote, or you'd simply have \nshut up and listened. That's not the liberal reflex. Nor is it the \nconservative reflex. The reflex you have, and should outgrow one day, is \nthe habit of attacking someone who disagrees with you or your idols as if \nthey're your favorite \"THEM.\"\nIt's paranoid and infantile.\nThis 'either/or, left/right, Dem/Rep' dichotomy that you and so many other \nlight-minded individuals buy into is a CONSTRUCT that has no bearing on \nreality.\nYou spent far more time insulting than actually saying anything, and all \nyou DID say lacked any substance...it wasn't even as good as a \ntalking-point. You barfed out a slogan and called it a day. Say something \nsubstantive to earn my respect. Just disliking the right doesn't make you a \nwarrior. It makes you a PUPPET.\n\nI support a single-payer system for this country. In my fifty-plus years, \nI've seen plenty of people pass away, or far more commonly, go bankrupt, \nbecause of this country's overpriced health-care system. You're a bad \nperson because you equate me with people who wish for others to die for \npolitical reasons. You should stop being a bad person. I'm human, you're \nhuman, and this program has hurt real people. Some of them, even people you \nwould hang out with and party with. You remove their faces and \npersonalities online, and attack them for your misunderstanding of their \nreasonable ideology, without even asking what it is. You need to \nunderstand, that makes you a hideous person, a caricature of a human.\n\nHaving said that, I ABHOR Obamacare for the shitty half-measure it is, as \ndoes any reasonable person who got the LIED-ABOUT end of the stick. I work \nin a factory with almost 300 other people, and we had a FINE health care \nprogram, which I tailored to suit myself and my four boys.\nThen came the UNaffordable Health Care act, and many of us lost our doctor, \nand all of us lost our health care. What replaced it costs 60% more, and \ncovers about 2/3 of what it used to. Out-of-pocket expenses nearly doubled. \nAnd it covers stuff I do not and will not ever need, like maternity care. \nAll-male family. Brilliant plan.\n\nI am now in the position of having to make risky financial decisions that \nare WORSE than before. I never until Obamacare had to be this careful about \nwhat I buy for groceries, cutting back on them, and shaving away simple \nluxuries and basic needs.\nI am, because of this plan, choosing between health care and FOOD that we \nenjoy, so a bunch of feelgood know-nothings can boast how they improved \nAmerican life as a triumph over evil.\nWhat a bunch of fucksticks. This law has hurt me and my family, and there's \nnot a chance in hell you could deny it or convince me it's a good thing. I \ncan point to my household budget and say, \"THERE! Right there! That's \nfucking me.\" I can see it every time we go to the doctor. I can see it when \nwe no longer have DENTAL.\n\nSo seriously, you bloviating nobody, fuck you and all those who support \nthis abortion so ignorantly and whole-heartedly, while probably NOT \nenrolling in it. You're hot air and white noise with no basis in reality.\n\nObama was bought and paid for by the same corporations as Bush, and if Bush \nhadn't been prosecuting a war, he would have gone after our health care \nwith the same incompetence and vigor as this president. He might have done \na DIFFERENT fucked-up bill, but the net result wouldn't have differed by a \nwhisker.\n\nThis is reality, kid. The insurance companies got their boondoggle, and \nObama got a tainted legacy.\n\nIn case you can't tell, I'm not asking what you think of it, or of me. \nYou're shallow enough to think Bill Maher is some sort of voice of reason. \nI'm simply telling you the daily reality of why I don't believe a word of \nyour bullshit, or of theirs. You're all a bunch of idiots.\n\nGoogle that, asswipe."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtrGh7Ixta_D8lgp1Bn5uvQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.50761421319796951, "authorDisplayName": "pete burkeet", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12neltyst2fsn5vy22lzrkhury1c54yg04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-18T22:35:16.049Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCtrGh7Ixta_D8lgp1Bn5uvQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.54615400000000003, "formal_score": 94, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-18T22:35:16.049Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Eqt_Zs5UaNQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKU/nOdgGgDmcug/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103591745686409168669", "textDisplay": "+OneVoiceMore Sheesh.

I'm putting \nthis out there because I promise I want the affordable healthcare act to \nwork. I hope I still have several years ahead o me. Ok if you've read my \ncomments you can tell I'm very cynical and have very little faith in our \ngovernment. I believe the two party system is a failure and that they have \nbeen colluding with each other for decades. Consider the 2012 election and \nhow the media succeeded in shutting Ron Paul out of the election. \nPersonally I don't believe Obama care was passed for any kind of noble \ncause. I believe that it's very likely that the insurance lobbyist that \nlive in DC probably wrote a major portion of this bill. Now I've not lived \nin a country with socialized medicine so my take on it is from forums and \nblogs I've read from people in the UK mostly. You're probably saying this \nisn't socialized medical care. For now I'll argue that I know for sure that \na fortune 50 corporation is dumping all its employees in the program. \nCompanies are getting out of the people business, they've done away with \nretirements where you draw a check and retain medical benefits from the \ncompany you worked 30 years for those days are gone. There are many \nelements that will start Jan 1st 2015 so I believe we'll have lots more \ninformation in a year or so. \nI used to be a republican until George W and the Patriot act, two wars we \nknow all this stuff. There are a few things that concern me about Obama \nfirst he not only embraced the Patriot act, he's expanded on it. Second I \ndon't believe governments spy on its people to keep them safe. As far as \nthe theater in congress, I believe there's a very real possibility our \nsystem is so broken its got to be crashed and then we start over idk I'm \nguessing on that one. I guess it's possible that we've elected a bunch of \nidiots. Anyway I'm hoping that my concerns prove to be unfounded and that \nwe all live long healthy and happy lives.

Maybe it was the towers, maybe it was Bush \nbeing very vocal in his political stance that others dissected it more. \nHell, it could have been Facebook and AIM that made things much more \npronounced. But I question was it in the early 2000's or post Iraq war, \nbecause that too me was the great separator of our time. Even though many \nannounce its disagreement with it today. But you are right, no matter when \nit happened, it still hurts us today as a country and as a what is supposed \nto be a compromising government. \n\nThank you, again, and I look forward to reading more replies from you in \nthe future."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvNe9ct3KCbFqXeWVW8yjdQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jacob Wilkins", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ejpcw3yalcfihs04chzdbjvr0jfozh5g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-19T21:18:41.956Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvNe9ct3KCbFqXeWVW8yjdQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.44439199999999995, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-19T21:18:41.956Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dnxd1p1G7jw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/uN4u41CLE0s/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110516891608587749446", "textDisplay": "+Patrick Gaasche I have a somewhat unique (and somewhat moderate) view on \nthe situation.\n\n\nI personally think his administration has been a failure, although I don't \nthink he himself is a failure.
