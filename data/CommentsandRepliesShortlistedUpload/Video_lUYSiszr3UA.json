Just remember this when the Democrats win the \npresidency again, that there are lots of conservatives who can't associate \nthemselves with republicans anymore. You guys just keep pushing til only \nthe nut job tea baggers are left in the republican party.

They didn't come to that bakery in spite, \nknowing that the bakery was Christian owned. They received unfair treatment \nand it wasn't right for that woman to do what she did.\n\nAnd you know what the funny thing is? Those lesbians were also Christians \nas well.

Subsequently\u2013especially given all the media attention the \nstory was getting\u2013the Bowman-Cryers received constant threats and \nharassment from Klein\u2019s supporters. As a result of the constant harassment \nand threats, the Bowman-Cryers were told by adoption officials that they \nwere responsible for keeping their foster children safe from these nutjobs \nand feared they might lose them. So, they\u2019re not being fined simply for \nsticking to their religious beliefs and being very holy and moral and \npure\u2013they\u2019re being fined for doxxing people. The Kleins were found to be \nresponsible for the harassment Bowman-Cryers were subjected to\u2013with the \njudge finding that any reasonable person should know that posting someone\u2019s \naddress and phone number on the internet could lead to them being harassed. \nSo, while Melissa and Aaron Klein may insist that this is all over them \nbeing \u201cpersecuted for being Christians\u201d\u2013which yeah, not a thing, sorry\u2013this \nis about them and all their very holy and Christlike friends persecuting \nthe Bowman-Cryers.\"\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z120if2jztr3vneht04cebag1tz2uvjghsk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0xLU1g47haCOzNEOMtfk_g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nBMumNFXdJw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOU/hUt6kFeLS7w/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Pam Ruebusch", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-30T22:59:03.379Z", "videoId": "lUYSiszr3UA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0xLU1g47haCOzNEOMtfk_g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.54342800000000002, "formal_score": 9, "updatedAt": "2014-09-30T22:59:03.379Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103922243052329893168", "textDisplay": "Louis said it best, She's a martyr.  \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13nhhfhdsqctntto22ouvly5saqcjyez": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUD3zqRU94sbmpgPF_-kfOA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PKjDoNQi4tQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD-s/oW0pzMkoRF0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.49382716049382713, "authorDisplayName": "Jane Hammond", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-07T16:32:48.822Z", "videoId": "lUYSiszr3UA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUD3zqRU94sbmpgPF_-kfOA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.44713399999999998, "formal_score": 60, "updatedAt": "2015-07-07T17:39:06.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105344293674039771095", "textDisplay": "''So Called Religious Beliefs''..as your opening preamble..\nYour title states ''Anti-Gay'' and ''Bigoted Business''\nthere is a big difference from loving our brothers and Sisters,\nand condoning choices that conflict with sincerely held beliefs..\nWhat has happened here is a group that has come SO far,and should be \ncelebrating, \ninstead are being totally vitriolic by demanding tolerance and acceptance \nfrom society ,whilst REFUSING to be tolerant and accepting of other people \nchoices..\nYour presentation puts such a biased view, YOUR view..without any \nreal,common sense thinking whatsoever ..\nYour presentation is such a distortion of the actual truth that your \nreporting fails to be credible..\nI have NEVER seen such disgusting, biased, news reporting in my entire \nlife..\n''Christians Love Martyrs''\nOh Boy !!\nDavid Pakman, it is YOU that are the bigot...\nI hardly EVER get angry, but wow,what a piece of work you are..\nShame on You David Pakman,for not presenting this news issue,in a fair and \nunbiased way...\nI am heartbroken to see some of the comments on this thread..\ncalling Melissa ''A Whore'' ''The Business should burn'' ...\nIf THAT is not classed as blatant intolerance then I dont know what is\nJane from England..\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12lw3axrojcxvkyi04ci5fa3oq1htng2uo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzT-swzZK0tcJb0a9ip2A5A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-m6kY6ABKs9o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD4/e3EqCJIs5fY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Zero Gullibility", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-20T02:23:00.344Z", "videoId": "lUYSiszr3UA", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCzT-swzZK0tcJb0a9ip2A5A"}, "sentiment_score": 0.13617600000000002, "formal_score": 35, "updatedAt": "2015-07-20T02:23:00.344Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112344401938237800232", "textDisplay": "It's not likely that the majority of Republicans are as stupid as they \nseem.

A white man has the right to dislike \nblack people, as long as it does not transcend into racism and becomes a \ndetriment to those particular people. With that said, the bakery owners \nshould have just as much right to deny the order for their religious \nconvictions as well as the entitlement of the homosexual couple.

That's one of my \nmain issues with the LGBT community, they scream that they want equality \nbut yet, go beyond the limit and flat out override the other groups. In my \nobservance, I have found them to be utterly accommodated over everyone \nelse. The only group that I believe can garner more sympathy than the LGBT \ncommunity is the mentally disordered. Then again, if gay people admitted \nthat their sexual orientation was a mental disorder ( which I myself am not \nimplying that it is) then they would be on equal ground with them. The \nbottom line you fight \"bigotry\" with bigotry by overly favoring one group \nover the other. Yes, the lesbian couple has been disregarded but, we have \nto respect everyone's beliefs not just one. If  a person's beliefs does not \ncondone homosexuality then, that has to be respected. You don't have to \nlike it, but respect it for the sake of true equality not, having one group \nbitch slapping the other and calling it \"equality\".

Salvation is given in grace (unmerited favor); it is not \nsomething we can earn with good deeds.\n\nYes, a person must recognize that they are a sinner (which is a big problem \nfor gays),  repent (change their minds about Jesus Christ), AND accept that \nJesus Christ is God, & that salvation comes through faith alone in Christ \nalone.\n\n\"He said, \u201cSirs, what must I do to be saved?\u201d They said, \u201cBelieve in the \nLord Jesus, and you will be saved.\u201d (ACT 16:30b-31a)\n\n\u201cHe who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey \n[believe in Jesus Christ] the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God \nabides on him.\u201d (JOH 3:36) "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbLCyJ6brcgITzdMFIgCPcA", "inappropriate_score": 1.3698630136986301, "authorDisplayName": "mitch rawles", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12vw5nbpvazi3rfs23wytfpztmffp03b", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-29T11:06:27.277Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCbLCyJ6brcgITzdMFIgCPcA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.30366200000000004, "formal_score": 98, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-29T11:06:27.277Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EcBfn4BlBJw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/82WDeFfpW2w/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100671397346033516053", "textDisplay": "I warn Homosexuals of their sin so they can go to Heaven .

That means that they ALL go \nagainst the Creator's plan & intentions for His creation.\n\n\"For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served \nthe creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever.

The USA is being flushed down the proverbial \ntoilet, just like the UK & other countries who reject Jesus Christ.  This, \nlike all other prophecies that preceded it, WILL come to fruition.  I don't \nexpect you to read all of this (most people aren't interested in the \nTruth), but I write it because there will be at least one curious soul who \nmight learn something & turn from their wicked ways.\n\nGod said that as the end comes for unbelievers on Earth, the following has \nto happen:\n\n\"\"For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will \nlead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that \nyou are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For \nnation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there \nwill be famines and earthquakes in various places.\" (Matt 24:5-7)\n\nThis sounds like Earth today, doesn't it?  Does this all point to \"full \nsteam ahead into spirituality\"?  I don't think so.\n\nBut wait!!  \"\"all of these [see verse above] are but the BEGINNING \n[emphasis mine] of the birth pains\" (Matt 24:8)\n\n\"But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will \nbe lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, \ndisobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, \nunforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the \ngood, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers \nof God\u2014 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to \ndo with such people. They are the kind who worm their way into homes & gain \ncontrol over gullible women, who are loaded down w/ sins & are swayed by \nall kinds of evil desires, always learning but never able to come to a \nknowledge of the truth. Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also \nthese teachers oppose the truth. They are men of depraved minds, who, as \nfar as the faith is concerned, are rejected. But they will not get very far \nbecause, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to \neveryone.\" (2 Tim 3)\n\nThere's much more, but I think you get my point.  This sound like Earth \ntoday, doesn't it?  Does this all point to \"full steam ahead into \nspirituality\"?  No, I don't think so.\n\nI believe these changes are exciting for the Christians, because they \nsignal the closeness of the time when Jesus Christ will return to remove us \nfrom the Earth [\"Jesus says, \"But concerning that day and hour no one \nknows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.\" \n(Matt 24:36)].  God will then allow unbelievers to go through a 7 yr period \nwhere the 1st 3.5 yrs they will be deceived into thinking the world is a \nbetter place & there is peace at last, & then the worse horrors & \ndestruction will come upon the face of the Earth when God gives permission \nfor Satan & his fallen angels to do what they wish with the humans \n(unbelievers like you).  The unbelievers will be provided with a way out \nthrough Jesus Christ, just like they are now, but those that refuse will \nsuffer horribly & will end up with their savior, Satan, in the Lake of \nFire, when Jesus Christ returns after that 7 years of \"tribulation\".

No weapon formed against us will \nprosper. God is going to do something to bless the people who were true to \ntheir convictions and there is some terrible problem that is going to come \nup upon the lesbian couple at some point.\n\nWhether that lesbian couple spends or loses all that money and gets a \ndivorce or something worse that all depends upon the Lord's decision.\n\nYou cannot play with the Lord Jesus and get away with it.

An\nannulment is a legal procedure which cancels a marriage between a man \nand a woman. Annulling a marriage is as though it is completely erased -\nlegally, it declares that the marriage never technically existed and \nwas never valid.\n\nA divorce, or legal dissolution of a marriage, is the ending \nof a valid marriage between a man and a woman returning both parties to \nsingle status with the ability to remarry. While each individual state \nhas its own laws regarding grounds for marriage annulment or divorce, \ncertain requirements apply nationwide. \n\nAn annulment case can be initiated by either the husband or the wife \nin the marriage. The party initiating the annulment must prove that he \nor she has the grounds to do so and if it can be proven, the marriage \nwill be considered null and void by the court. The following is a list \nof common grounds for annulment and a short explanation of each point: \n\nBigamy - either party was already married to another person at the time of \nthe marriage \n\nForced Consent - one of the spouses was forced or threatened into marriage \nand only entered into it under duress \n\nFraud - one of the spouses agreed to the marriage based on the lies or \nmisrepresentation of the other \n\nMarriage Prohibited By Law - marriage between parties that based on their \nfamilial relationship is considered incestuous \n\nMental Illness - either spouse was mentally ill or emotionally disturbed at \nthe time of the marriage \n\nMental Incapacity - either spouse was under the influence of alcohol or \ndrugs at the time of the marriage and was unable to make informed consent \n\n*Inability to Consummate Marriage - either spouse was physically incapable \nof having sexual relations or impotent during the marriage*\n\nUnderage Marriage - either spouse was too young to enter into marriage \nwithout parental consent or court approval \n\nDepending on your state of residence, a divorce can be much more \ncomplicated than an annulment. Like annulment cases, each state has its \nown set of laws regarding divorce. In most divorce cases, marital assets\nare divided and debts are settled. If the marriage has produced \nchildren, a divorce proceeding determines custody of the children, \nvisitation rights and spousal and child support issues. \n\nEach state can have either a no-fault divorce or a fault divorce.\nA no-fault divorce allows the dissolution of a legal marriage with \nneither spouse being named the \"guilty party\" or the cause for the \nmarital break-up. \n\nMany states now offer the \"no-fault\" divorce option, a dissolution of\na legal marriage in which neither party accepts blame for the marital \nbreak-up. In the absence of a \"guilty party,\" some states require a \nwaiting period of a legal separation before a no-fault divorce can take \nplace. For this reason, in addition to cases where one spouse wishes to \nassign blame, some parties seek to expedite the legal process by \npursuing a traditional, \"fault\" divorce. \n\nA \"fault\" divorce is only granted when one spouse can prove adequate \ngrounds. Like an annulment, these grounds vary from state to state, \nhowever, there are some overarching commonalities. These guidelines \noften include addition to drugs, alcohol or gambling, incurable mental \nillness, and conviction of a crime. The major grounds for divorce that \napply in every state are listed below: \n\nAdultery - one or both spouses engages in extramarital relationships with \nothers during the marriage \n\nDesertion - one spouse abandons the other, physically and emotionally, for \na lengthy period of time \n\nPhysical/Emotional Abuse - one spouse subjects the \nother to physical or violent attacks or emotional or psychological abuse\nsuch as abusive language, and threats of physical violence  \n\nYour state law and particular situation will determine whether or not\nyour annulment or divorce will be simple or complex.

Did tax-deductions reimburse \nyou the all the money you spent to get your business off the ground? Do \ntax-deductions pay you for every hour, week, season, or decade you spend \nworking on your business? Does the local government make all the hard \ndecisions for you, and take all the risk?

If I choose to shoot a white male, I \ntargeted him. Does that Automatically mean I did it out of hate? judging \nmotivations usually amounts to speculation. Now if someone blatantly say's \n\"I'm gonna kill you nigger!\" I STILL don't think they should be charged for \ntheir motivations. they could be charged for slander, but presuming racism \nis still speculation, and you know they're going to say they didn't mean it \n(whether they really did or not). I think at the end of the day your \nactions should outweigh your motivations. at least in court.

During the segregation era a lot of businesses tried to \nsay that serving blacks the same as whites, or for some serving them at \nall, was against their beliefs. They would do it the extent that they \nactually would attempt to drive black owned businesses out of business by \nhaving it that the only people that would sell supplies to them would be \ncompanies that jacked up the prices to unreasonable levels. Or for normal \ncustomers they would do stuff like sell a hamburger to a white man for .50 \nwhile selling the exact same burger to a black man for 3.00.\nIt was decided that that kind of thing hurt the local economy, because it \nwould drive business away. \nIn large cities it doesn't hurt the customer very much because there are \nother local businesses that probably provide the same service. But if this \nwas to be allowed think about what affect it would have in small towns, \nwhere that place is the only ones that provide that service in the area. \nHere's an example. Say you live in a small town, with only one grocery \nstore and it's a 2 hour drive just to get to the next nearest town. The \nmajority of the people that live in the town are Protestant, only you and \none other family aren't. Then the owner of the grocery store decides that \nthey are only going to sell to other Protestants. Now you have to drive 2 \nhours just to buy groceries. And that doesn't consider the possibility that \nthat town feels the same. Would you file a complaint with Labor and \nIndustries if you knew what they were doing was illegal? If you would then \nyou would do the exact same thing that the Lesbian couple did.

Egyptians and Romans both had \nunisex clothing, they shaved or plucked their beards, they both had \nhomosexuality - so all of these acts became illegal for the Israelites.  \nBut God never mentions them.  Ever.  God never mentions homosexuality at \nall.

He does not call it sin, especially \nsince God is intentionally  giving this group of people over to  \nhomosexuality - God does not make any one sin. \n\nThere IS an actual sin in the story - when the people make the graven image \nof God to worship and it is BECAUSE of this, that God gave them over to \nhomosexuality:\n\n(Romans 1:22)\nProfessing themselves to be wise, they became fools,\n\n(Romans 1:23)\n*And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to \ncorruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things*.\n\n(Romans 1:24)\nWherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their \nown hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:\n\n(Romans 1:25)\nWho changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the \ncreature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.\n\n(Romans 1:26)\nFor this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women \ndid change the natural use into that which is against nature:\n\n(Romans 1:27)\nAnd likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in \ntheir lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, \nand receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.\n\nREAD the story - none of this is hard math, unless you are trying to twist \nit into some thing other than it actually says.\n\nmaking a graven image to worship is breaking the 2nd Commandment.  AN \nACTUAL SIN.\nAnd the punishment for breaking the 2nd Commandment is also explained:\n\n[(Exodus 20:4)\nThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any \nthing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is \nin the water under the earth:\n\n(Exodus 20:5)\nThou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy \nGod am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the \nchildren unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;]\n\n*Read the punishment for the sin carefully - God visits the iniquity upon \nthe CHILDREN until the third and fourth generation*.\n\nThis is why Paul does not say that the people were destroyed or doomed to \nHell, because they were not.  The recompense that was meet - meaning, the \nresult that was appropriate for breaking the 2nd Commandment was that the \npunishment would be upon their children...\n\nSo by making them burn with sexual passion for only the same sex, they have \nno pregnancy - NO children are allowed to be born.  They die out with no \nfamily heirs.\n\nThis is Sunday School class - again not hard to read, not hard to \nunderstand at all.  UNLESS you are trying to twist the story to make it fit \nyour own false agenda.\n\nIn the Bible there is the Commandments from God and then there is the law \nof Moses.\n\nGod gave the 10 Commandments to Moses, and made a covenant with Moses to \nmake him the lawgiver to the Israelite people.\n\nThen Moses went on to ADD 603 more laws.. cruel, sexist, racist, and \nabstract laws.\n\nSo Jesus comes to fulfill the covenant between God and Moses, so that the \nlaw can be ended.  He explains that when He comes to John the Baptist to be \nbaptized.\n\n(Matthew 3:13)\nThen cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.\n\n(Matthew 3:14)\nBut John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest \nthou to me?\n\n(Matthew 3:15)\nAnd Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: *for thus it \nbecometh us to fulfil all righteousness*. Then he suffered him.\n\n\n(Matthew 5:17)\n*Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not \ncome to destroy, but to fulfil*.\n\n(Matthew 5:18)\nFor verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, *one jot or one \ntittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled*.\n\nJesus does not abolish the law - that would be breaking covenant with \nMoses.  Instead He fulfills the covenant, which ends the agreement.  And \nthen dies for our behalf, taking all transgressions with Him.  This is why \nHe is called the Lamb of God - Jesus is sacrificed for us.\n\nThen in the resurrection, Christ offers a NEW covenant for all who accept \nHim as Lord.  We are no longer under the law of Moses, we are restored to \nthe 10 Commandments, and Jesus adds to them.  To the list of sins in the \ncommandments, Christ adds one more - blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, the \nonly unpardonable sin.\n\nThe sins are WELL defined, and the entire law of Moses is ended - and the \nreasons for this are explained in the many verses i have already posted in \nthis thread, but also very specifically in Galatians 3:1-29.\n\nYou do not get to decide what is sin and what is not.  Neither did Moses, \nor Paul, or me - God defined the sins, which are all offenses toward God.  \nIt is a short list - and it does NOT include a lot of actual evil, harmful \nacts that some people think SHOULD have been defined as sins - but none of \nus are really in the position to tell God how to BE a God."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwS6kcsGZ-HaKqz2ATjmK-A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "sharper68", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qutxgwmunupgao04cefqrolrjg5fyqkw0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-04T15:13:06.088Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwS6kcsGZ-HaKqz2ATjmK-A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.94096230000000003, "formal_score": 40, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-04T15:13:06.088Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AbaSBNaRfp4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/E3PjLywqy8o/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108597364085311138683", "textDisplay": "+ace8842 No one cares what you think is a sin,  it means precisely nothing \nto anyone who does not buy your backward dogma."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZIE4Dsd7KwY6ZuPzjLy9JQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ace8842", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qutxgwmunupgao04cefqrolrjg5fyqkw0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-04T14:54:06.946Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZIE4Dsd7KwY6ZuPzjLy9JQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.83798410000000001, "formal_score": 50, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-04T14:54:06.946Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113807005844791871880", "textDisplay": "Homosexuality isn't called a sin, it's only caleld perverse, detestable, \nand unseemly?

Paul begins \nhis writing by describing humanity's rebellion and decision to worship \ncreation rather than the Creator. The pro-gay theorist seizes on this \nconcept to prove that Paul's condemnation of homosexuality does not apply \nto him-he does not worship idols, he is a Christian.\n\n\"But,\" Schmidt cautions, \"Paul is not suggesting that a person worships an \nidol and decides therefore to engage in same-sex relations. Rather, he is \nsuggesting that the general rebellion created the environment for the \nspecific rebellion. A person need not bow before a golden calf to \nparticipate in the general human denial of God or to express that denial \nthrough specific behaviors.\"[85]\n\nA common sense look at the entire chapter bears this out. Several sins \nother than homosexuality are mentioned in the same passage:\n\nFornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, \ndebate, deceit, malignity, whisperers; backbiters, haters of God, \ndisobedient to parents.... (vv 29-30)\n\nWill the interpretation applied to the verse 26-27 also apply to verses \n29-30? Any sort of intellectual integrity demands it. If verses 26-27 apply \nto people who commit homosexual acts in connection with idolatry, and thus \nhomosexuals acts are not sinful if not committed in connection with \nidolatry, then the same must apply to verses 29-30 as well.\n\nTherefore, we must assume that fornication, wickedness, covetousness, \nmaliciousness et al are also condemned by Paul only because they were \ncommitted by people involved in idolatry; they are permissible otherwise.\n\nWhich is, of course, ridiculous. Like homosexuality, these sins are not \njust born of idol worship; they are symptomatic of a fallen state. If we \nare to say homosexuality is legitimate, so long as it's not a result of \nidol worship, then we also have to say these other sins are legitimate as \nwell, so long as they, too, are not practiced as a result of idolatry."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw_okzEpQfbZc4ZSKKeYx4g", "inappropriate_score": 0.041675349031048137, "authorDisplayName": "Mikanojo", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qutxgwmunupgao04cefqrolrjg5fyqkw0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-04T02:27:54.457Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCw_okzEpQfbZc4ZSKKeYx4g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.31185799999999997, "formal_score": 81, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-04T02:27:54.457Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NfuESSt1Z4M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAc8/CChEazg_6kA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101929509842161102383", "textDisplay": "+ace8842 Actually if you think that Romans 1:26-28 is about calling \nhomosexuality a sin then you should consider reading the whole story.  God \ngave the group of people over to homosexuality, so that the men burned with \npassion for the men and the women for the women, why?  To make them sin?  \nAbsolutely not.  Homosexuality is NOT defined as a sin in that story, but a \nsin IS committed - the group breaks the 2nd Commandment, they create a \ngraven image of God\n\n(Romans 1:18)\nFor the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and \nunrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;\n\n(Romans 1:19)\nBecause that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath \nshewed it unto them.\n\n(Romans 1:20)\nFor the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly \nseen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power \nand Godhead; so that they are without excuse:\n\n(Romans 1:21)\nBecause that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither \nwere thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish \nheart was darkened.\n\n(Romans 1:22)\nProfessing themselves to be wise, they became fools,\n\n(Romans 1:23)\n*And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to \ncorruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things*.\n\n*THAT IS THE SIN - the people broke the 2nd Commandment by creating a \ngraven image to worship*.\n\n[(Exodus 20:4)\nThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any \nthing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is \nin the water under the earth:\n\n(Exodus 20:5)\nThou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy \nGod am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the \nchildren unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;]\n\n*Read the punishment for the sin carefully - God visits the iniquity upon \nthe CHILDREN until the third and fourth generation*.\n\n(Romans 1:24)\nWherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their \nown hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:\n\n(Romans 1:25)\nWho changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the \ncreature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.\n\n(Romans 1:26)\nFor this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women \ndid change the natural use into that which is against nature:\n\n(Romans 1:27)\nAnd likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in \ntheir lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, \nand receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.\n\n(Romans 1:28)\nAnd even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave \nthem over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;\n\n(Romans 1:29)\nBeing filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, \ncovetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, \nmalignity; whisperers,\n\n(Romans 1:30)\nBackbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil \nthings, disobedient to parents,\n\n(Romans 1:31)\nWithout understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, \nimplacable, unmerciful:\n\n(Romans 1:32)\nWho knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are \nworthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do \nthem.\n\n\nGod made them gay.  Since God does not force people to sin, that is not the \nsin - but how does making them burn with passion for the same sex fulfill \nthe punishment given for breaking the 2nd Commandment?  Paul refers to it \nas being \"that recompense of their error which was meet\".  Is it death?  \nNo.. condemnation into Hell?  No.. what IS the recompense for only having \nhomosexual sex?  NO PREGNANCY.  NO CHILDREN BORN.\n\nGod carried out His warning against those who create a graven image of God, \nan idol to worship, by not allowing their children to be born.\n\nThe entire Bible, both Old and New Testament is a collected work of stories \ntold by people who had some contact with God.  In that sense, it is all \nGod-inspired, and stories about God are indeed God-breathed.  But not every \none in the Bible is Christian, in fact NO one was Christian until after \nChrist came and taught His ministry.  Moses was NOT Christian, Solomon was \nNOT Christian.\n\nPaul is not God in the flesh, and Moses is not God the father - and you \nwould be an absolute fool to intentionally confuse them.\n\nThe Law of Moses was the condition that the Israelites were suffering \nunder, condemned in every way.  God gave the 10 Commandments, but then \nMoses added 603 MORE laws of his own, including the so-called abomination \nlaws. Moses made abstract laws about every thing from what clothes to wear \nand what food to eat.  And homosexuality IS found in the law of Moses, but \nit is NOT found in the sins defined by God and NOT part of the Grace of \nChrist.\n\nDid God say homosexuality was a sin?  NO.\n\nAre any of the laws of Moses defined as sin?\nNO.\n\nJesus fulfills and ENDS the law of Moses for all who believe - for all who \naccept Jesus as Lord and savior - we are NOT under the law.  For those that \nchoose the law of Moses instead, they are already doomed to face judgement \nby the law that justifies no one.\n\nThey are cursed.  And the Bible tells us this\n\n(Matthew 3:13)\nThen cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.\n\n(Matthew 3:14)\nBut John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest \nthou to me?\n\n(Matthew 3:15)\nAnd Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: *for thus it \nbecometh us to fulfil all righteousness*. Then he suffered him.\n\n\n(Matthew 5:17)\n*Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not \ncome to destroy, but to fulfil*.\n\n(Matthew 5:18)\nFor verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, *one jot or one \ntittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled*.\n\n(Mark 16:16)\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not \nshall be damned.\n\n(John 1:17)\nFor the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.\n\n(1 Corinthians 10:23)\n*All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things \nare lawful for me, but all things edify not*.\n\n(Ephesians 2:8)\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is \nthe gift of God:\n\n(Ephesians 2:9)\nNot of works, lest any man should boast.\n\n(Ephesians 2:15)\nHaving abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments \ncontained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so \nmaking peace;\n\n\n(Romans 8:1)\n*There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, \nwho walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit*.\n\n(Romans 8:2)\n*For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from \nthe law of sin and death*.\n\n(Romans 8:3)\n*For what the law could not do*, in that it was weak through the flesh, God \nsending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned \nsin in the flesh:\n\n(Romans 8:4)\nThat the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not \nafter the flesh, but after the Spirit.\n\n(Romans 8:5)\nFor they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they \nthat are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.\n\n(Romans 8:6)\nFor to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life \nand peace.\n\n(Romans 8:7)\nBecause the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the \nlaw of God, neither indeed can be.\n\n(Romans 8:15)\n*For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have \nreceived the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father*.\n\n(Romans 8:16)\nThe Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children \nof God:\n\n(Romans 10:4)\n*For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that \nbelieveth*.\n\nRomans 10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be \nsaved.\n\n(Galatians 5:18)\n*But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law*.\n\nSo Jesus came to fulfill the law of Moses to END it for those who believe \nin Him.  The law still exists for those who REJECT Christ.  But for we who \nare saved, we are saved FROM the law.\n\nStill not enough?  Still not clear?  There is much more:\n\n(Galatians 3:1)\nO foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the \ntruth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, \ncrucified among you?\n\n(Galatians 3:2)\nThis only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit *by the works of the \nlaw, or by the hearing of faith*?\n\n(Galatians 3:3)\nAre ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by \nthe flesh?\n\n(Galatians 3:4)\nHave ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.\n\n(Galatians 3:5)\nHe therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among \nyou, *doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith*?\n\n(Galatians 3:10)\n*For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse*: for it is \nwritten, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are \nwritten in the book of the law to do them.\n\n(Galatians 3:11)\n*But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God*, it is \nevident: for, The just shall live by faith.\n\n(Galatians 3:12)\n*And the law is not of faith*: but, The man that doeth them shall live in \nthem.\n\n(Galatians 3:13)\n*Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law*, being made a curse for \nus: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:\n(Galatians 3:14)\nThat the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus \nChrist; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.\n\n(Galatians 3:15)\nBrethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's \ncovenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.\n\n(Galatians 3:16)\nNow to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to \nseeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.\n\n(Galatians 3:17)\nAnd this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in \nChrist, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot \ndisannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.\n\n(Galatians 3:18)\nFor if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God \ngave it to Abraham by promise.\n\n(Galatians 3:19)\nWherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, \ntill the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained \nby angels in the hand of a mediator.\n\n(Galatians 3:20)\nNow a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.\n\n(Galatians 3:21)\nIs the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had \nbeen a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should \nhave been by the law.\n\n(Galatians 3:22)\nBut the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith \nof Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\n\n\n(Galatians 3:23)\n*But before faith came, we were kept under the law*, shut up unto the faith \nwhich should afterwards be revealed.\n\n(Galatians 3:24)\n*Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we \nmight be justified by faith*.\n\n(Galatians 3:25)\n*But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster*.\n\n(Galatians 3:26)\nFor ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.\n\n(Galatians 3:27)\nFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.\n\n(Galatians 3:28)\nThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is \nneither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\n\n(Galatians 3:29)\nAnd if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to \nthe promise.\n\nSo, do you follow Moses or Christ?  Do you reject salvation from Christ to \nchoose the law, and be judged by the law your self?\n\n(Matthew 7:1)\nJudge not, that ye be not judged.\n\n(Matthew 7:2)\nFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure \nye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\n\nDo you think that just choosing to keep SOME of the law is acceptable?  \nEither you are saved from ALL of the law, or Christ died a meaningless \ndeath.  But if you choose the law, then you better learn it all and live by \nit all:\n\n(James 2:10)\nFor whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is \nguilty of all.\n\nSO put it all together - homosexuality is NEVER declared a sin by God, it \nIS an abomination law written by Moses - who is not Christian.  Then Christ \ncomes to fulfill the law and END it for all who believe in Him as savior.  \nAnd warns us NOT to judge by the law because you forfeit your salvation by \nGrace if you do!\n\nSo do you follow Moses as your excuse to attack homosexual people and \nhate?  Or do you accept Christ?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZIE4Dsd7KwY6ZuPzjLy9JQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ace8842", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qutxgwmunupgao04cefqrolrjg5fyqkw0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-04T02:03:41.150Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZIE4Dsd7KwY6ZuPzjLy9JQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.08759399999999995, "formal_score": 95, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-04T02:03:41.150Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113807005844791871880", "textDisplay": "You ignore the fact that ALL Scripture is God-breathed or inspired by \nGod..the inerrant Word of God.

By \ndenying Christ's work of ending the law and freeing us from it, you are \nliterally blaspheming against the Holy Spirit committing the one \nunpardonable sin - and by returning to the law of Moses, you enter into \napostasy.\n\nSo please do not attempt to make broad statements about homosexuality being \na sin, or about how Christians all feel about homosexuality.\n\nYou need to read your Bible a bit closer if you are going to preach from it.\n\nMaybe start with Galatians 3:1-29, since it is specifically all about how \nChrist freed us from the law."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwS6kcsGZ-HaKqz2ATjmK-A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "sharper68", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qutxgwmunupgao04cefqrolrjg5fyqkw0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-03T03:24:04.354Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwS6kcsGZ-HaKqz2ATjmK-A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.22015999999999997, "formal_score": 50, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-03T03:26:47.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AbaSBNaRfp4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/E3PjLywqy8o/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108597364085311138683", "textDisplay": "A Muslim baker should be forced to make that cake and likely would.

Many gays will not ever be convinced. \nThey know that Christians will not comply and are now on their own little \ngay inquisition to find and destroy all anti gay bigots. If they could read \nyour mind there would soon be laws to make anti gay thought illegal. Gays \nrefuse to believe that Christians do not demand their destruction. Many do \nnot accept that Christ instructed us to love the sinner and hate the sin. \nWhen the sin becomes central to ones life in most matters, it may be hard \nto understand this concept. My son steals candy in the store. I hate his \nsin, but still love him. This is how I consider those that live a gay \nlifestyle. I will admit that you irritate the hell out of me with your \ncrusade that many of you must rub in our faces. It is hard to turn the \nother cheek but that is what these Christian store owners are doing. They \nare in no way trying to destroy gays lives while gays destroy theirs.\n\nTell me, does it fill you with joy when you discover and destroy a \nChristian baker? I can honestly say that I would be appalled if a gay \nbusiness was targeted and attacked because they were gay. There are \nsupposed Christians that actually hate gays, but they are wrong and they \nknow it. There are many gays that want to out every Christian and destroy \nthem by force of law. Then there are gays that find it appalling that \nChristians are being sued for not making a gay wedding cake. Us peaceful \nfolks are in the middle of the fight between militant gays and Christians \nthat not only hate the sin, but the sinner as well. I do not paint every \ngay as a hater of Christians and there are gays that do not paint every \nChristian as a hater. Can we just leave each other alone or must it be a \nfight to ultimately destroy your enemy?\n\nI believe in forgiveness. A man that was on a Chic fil a viral video \nverbally attacking a drive through employee lost his job and when he found \nanother, he lost that one as well. He has a family and now they are all on \nfood stamps. I forgive him and would not wish for his family to pay for his \nbad judgement. I do not demand he reject his beliefs as a condition.\n\nOn the other hand, many gays have come out in defense of the Christian \nbakers, but it seems they are far outnumbered by the unforgiving  gay \ncrusaders that are bent on destruction no matter the impact on the innocent \nlives of family. They are actually celebrating the destruction of this \nfamily's business. Sad indeed.\n\n\nI sought and received a divorce from my first wife. It is legal by law, but \nforbidden by scripture.

So that statement would be from \nGod.\"\n\nOkay, then you must accept as being from God, the following excerpt from \nthe PD Bible, which recounts the story of God creating and blessing the \nfirst same-sex couple:\n\n\"Ge2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that this woman be alone; I \nwill make her a mate.\nGe2:19 And the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of \nthe air; and brought them unto Aida to see what she would call them: and \nwhatsoever Aida called every living creature, that was the name.\nGe2:20 And Aida gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and \nto every beast of the field; but for Aida there was not found a mate for \nher.\nGe2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Aida, and she \nslept: and he took one of her ribs, and closed up the flesh thereof;\nGe2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from woman, made he \nanother woman, and brought her unto the first.\nGe2:23 And Aida said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: \nshe shall be called Eve, because she was taken out of me.\nGe2:24 Therefore shall a woman leave her mother, and shall cleave unto her \nwife: and they shall be one flesh.' \nGe2:25 And they were both naked, the woman and her wife, and were not \nashamed.\"\n\nThat about says it all, huh? You can't argue with God."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ER4MUev9AJPTiuAnjIbZQ", "inappropriate_score": 2.9850746268656718, "authorDisplayName": "SynchroTotal", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ttxm5eoe2t3lqm04ccp0wxnj4zddqq1g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-28T16:15:03.937Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-ER4MUev9AJPTiuAnjIbZQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.79609599999999991, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-28T16:15:03.937Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uxpjwuiwbuM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABQ/od1ypDiO-JM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115244557445159651202", "textDisplay": "+Ted Heavy You LOST.

To become fully familiar with. \n\nSex is never spoken of plainly in the Bible, but  you would be foolish to \nassume the meaning of the word to seek a political end.\n\nHere is the iniquity of Sodom explained in two verses:\n\n(Ezekiel 16:49)\nBehold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, \nand abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she \nstrengthen the hand of the poor and needy.\n\n(Ezekiel 16:50)\nAnd they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I \ntook them away as I saw good.\n\nNotice the term abomination?  Sodom was a major trade city, full of pagan \ntemples, complete with temple prostitutes both female and male, to provide \nservices for the female and male worshipers during their seasonal fertility \nrites.  This is fornication, playing the harlot, with a direct connection \nto idol worship, idolatry.\n\nBut even if you wish to claim that homosexuality was one of the \nabominations happening in Sodom at that time, and homosexuality IS one of \nthe abomination laws of Moses - the whole story of Sodom takes place many \nmany years before the coming of Christ, to fulfill the law, so the laws of \nMoses were still in effect during the time of Sodom.\n\nThe problem with your wanting to pretend homosexuality is a sin, is that it \nsimply is not.  The list of actual sins is quite short, we have the 10 \nCommandments and then Jesus explained the one unpardonable sin.  There are \nmany evil acts, unhealthy acts, actual harmful acts that are definitely \n*inconvenient* or *not expedient* for Christians, as Paul wrote it, but the \nlaw of Moses is ended for all who accept Christ as savior.  So just like \nPaul,\n\n(1 Corinthians 10:23)\n*All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things \nare lawful for me, but all things edify not*.\n\nWe are told as Christians to obey the laws of the land where we live, so \nwhere ever sick evil acts such as bestiality, rape, pedophilia are illegal \nwe are told specifically to follow the law\n\n(1 Peter 2:13)\nSubmit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it \nbe to the king, as supreme;\n\n(1 Peter 2:14)\nOr unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of \nevildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.\n\n(1 Peter 2:15)\nFor so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the \nignorance of foolish men:\n\n(1 Peter 2:16)\nAs free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as \nthe servants of God.\n\nBut regarding the law of Moses, including the law about homosexuality...\n\n(Romans 8:1)\n*There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, \nwho walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit*.\n\n(Romans 8:2)\n*For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from \nthe law of sin and death*.\n\n(Romans 8:3)\n*For what the law could not do*, in that it was weak through the flesh, God \nsending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned \nsin in the flesh:\n\n(Romans 8:4)\nThat the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not \nafter the flesh, but after the Spirit.\n\n(Romans 8:5)\nFor they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they \nthat are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.\n\n(Romans 8:6)\nFor to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life \nand peace.\n\n(Romans 8:7)\nBecause the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the \nlaw of God, neither indeed can be.\n\n(Romans 8:15)\n*For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have \nreceived the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father*.\n\n(Romans 8:16)\nThe Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children \nof God:\n\n(Romans 10:4)\n*For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that \nbelieveth*.\n\nAnd if you are still not convinced, there is a whole chapter specifically \nabout this matter of the law of Moses being ended\n\n(Galatians 3:1)\nO foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the \ntruth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, \ncrucified among you?\n\n(Galatians 3:2)\nThis only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit *by the works of the \nlaw, or by the hearing of faith*?\n\n(Galatians 3:3)\nAre ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by \nthe flesh?\n\n(Galatians 3:4)\nHave ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.\n\n(Galatians 3:5)\nHe therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among \nyou, *doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith*?\n\n(Galatians 3:10)\n*For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse*: for it is \nwritten, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are \nwritten in the book of the law to do them.\n\n(Galatians 3:11)\n*But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God*, it is \nevident: for, The just shall live by faith.\n\n(Galatians 3:12)\n*And the law is not of faith*: but, The man that doeth them shall live in \nthem.\n\n(Galatians 3:13)\n*Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law*, being made a curse for \nus: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:\n(Galatians 3:14)\nThat the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus \nChrist; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.\n\n(Galatians 3:15)\nBrethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's \ncovenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.\n\n(Galatians 3:16)\nNow to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to \nseeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.\n\n(Galatians 3:17)\nAnd this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in \nChrist, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot \ndisannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.\n\n(Galatians 3:18)\nFor if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God \ngave it to Abraham by promise.\n\n(Galatians 3:19)\nWherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, \ntill the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained \nby angels in the hand of a mediator.\n\n(Galatians 3:20)\nNow a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.\n\n(Galatians 3:21)\nIs the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had \nbeen a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should \nhave been by the law.\n\n(Galatians 3:22)\nBut the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith \nof Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\n\n\n(Galatians 3:23)\n*But before faith came, we were kept under the law*, shut up unto the faith \nwhich should afterwards be revealed.\n\n(Galatians 3:24)\n*Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we \nmight be justified by faith*.\n\n(Galatians 3:25)\n*But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster*.\n\n(Galatians 3:26)\nFor ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.\n\n(Galatians 3:27)\nFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.\n\n(Galatians 3:28)\nThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is \nneither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\n\n(Galatians 3:29)\nAnd if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to \nthe promise.\n\nNone of the law of Moses was EVER defined as sin, only GOD defines sin.  \nANd Christ ENDS the covenant between God and Moses, and the curse of the \nlaw is lifted from all who accept Christ.\n\nWhile there are many acts that are evil, harmful, sick and destructive, the \nsins are offenses toward GOD.  They are separate from any man-made law, and \nChrist restores us to the 10 Commandments even as he ends the law of Moses.\n\nSO your attack on homosexuality is non-Christian.  Worse, it is carnal, not \nof faith, and as you try to judge others by the law of Moses, you are \nlosing your own salvation from Christ, choosing to be judged by the whole \nof the law instead."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDTe0pG2wIA_4hg28axC8Mw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Andrew Hall (Hij)", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ve3dblnqojnweg222wfqj2pi3hflsn", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-02T16:35:14.695Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDTe0pG2wIA_4hg28axC8Mw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.57059400000000005, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-02T16:35:14.695Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CWIpl_1sj5Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACg/k9q4xKSm8_c/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113699668121167667641", "textDisplay": "+Mikanojo \"gave them up unto *vile* affections\"   \"gave them over to a \n*reprobate* mind\"  so vile and reprobate are just fine and dandy?  also it \ndoesn't say that he forced them to do it because once again it would be \ncontradictory. in other instnces of worshipping false gods, God would have \nthe people destroy the idol and repent, and when he wanted to refuse \nchildren he just wouldn't let them get pregnant. why would god force his \npeople to do that which is \"vile\" or \"reprobate\"?  also just because \nhomosexuality is the second sin listed doesn't mean that it isn't sin. it's \njust the second sin listed.  and finally with that logic, what is the sin \nof Sodom and Gomorrah?

In \nthe story you are citing from, a group of people create a statue of God to \nworship - they make a graven image.  Here is the passage from the King \nJames Bible about it:\n\n(Romans 1:21)\nBecause that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither \nwere thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish \nheart was darkened.\n\n(Romans 1:22)\nProfessing themselves to be wise, they became fools,\n\n(Romans 1:23)\n*And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to \ncorruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things*.\n\n*THAT IS THE SIN - the people broke the 2nd Commandment by creating a \ngraven image to worship*.\n\n and that IS a sin.  IN fact that is the 2nd commandment.  So God makes \nthem homosexual to fulfill the recompence for the error which was meet.  \nWould God MAKE some one commit sin?  Absolutely not - that would be the \nopposite of free will.  Here is the 2nd commandment and the punishment for \nit:\n\n(Exodus 20:4)\nThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any \nthing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is \nin the water under the earth:\n\n(Exodus 20:5)\nThou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy \nGod am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the \nchildren unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;\n\n*Read the punishment for the sin carefully - God visits the iniquity upon \nthe CHILDREN until the third and fourth generation*.\n\nSo what IS the recompence of having only homosexual sex?\n\nNo pregnancy.  No children.  No heirs to their families to carry on the \nfamily name. \n\nGod punishes the people who broke the 2nd commandment by making them gay so \nthat their children will never be born.\n\nAnd those terms vile, and unseemly, inconvenient - those are the writing of \nPaul, who is telling the story.  Not God.  God is the one who gave the \npeople to burn with lust, but only homosexual lust - so that they could not \nhave children.
