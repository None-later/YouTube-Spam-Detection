All he cares about is justifying \nhimself and getting himself out of the negative light.\n\nJanet is absolutely right. He may have had the best intentions but he \nremains ignorant.

Pushing \nmisinformation about trans* people, by assuming there's some big secret she \nhad to tell her long-term partner, by assuming the important questions to \nask are about how this \"big\" change at the age of 18 had an impact on her \n(another sensationalizing of bottom surgery as THE \"transgender process\" \nwhich he keeps offensively using rather than just \"transgender people\" or \n\"transgender experience\"), and in the second interview having the GALL to \ntell her how to serve and represent her own community.\n\n Yes, I am going to point out that he is a white man because this entire \nconversation is about identity and how people are immediately read as \nsomething based on socially constructed narratives of race, gender, and \nclass. Piers Morgan assumed he could keep interrupting this black woman \nbecause he's been raised as a white man who has been given the patriarchal \nspace to do so. His leading questions into the individual body parts of \nMock, saying she is a \"proper woman\" because she fits his idea, as a \nstraight white man, of how a woman should look, and the emphasizing of the \n\"dirty secret\" that needs to be disclosed to straight men trans* woman get \nclose to all tell me that this white man is reproducing a culture of white \nsupremacy and patriarchy. He is a WHITE MAN, just like Janet Mock is a \nBLACK WOMAN, and we need to start that recognizing these identities are at \nthe heart of the conversations being had, not somehow tangential or racist \nif they're brought up. I am being purposefully dehumanizing to Morgan \nbecause he was dehumanizing to Janet Mock and tons of other girls who were \nwatching his show, and then he had the GALL to say HE was being vilified, \nthat HE had the target on his back.... he is a privileged white man that \ndecided to get his ratings up by acting like an Ally to the trans* \ncommunity and got all sad and \"woe is me\" the second a woman of color \npointed out his sexist and transphobic statements without refusing to be \ninterrupted just because the white man was talking. My use of the \"white \nman\" rhetoric is an explicitly strategic move to underwrite how this entire \nconversation is one in which Morgan, the white man, places all the \nresponsibility of education and sensitivity on the black woman in the room \nand her response to this has revived the classic trope of the \"Mad Black \nWoman\" in current arguments being had about this interview. This is \nracialized, this is gendered... and just because I'm bringing up Morgan's \nrace and gender as important points does not mean I'm doing the same \nhateful and symbolically violent work against him or his widely supported \ncommunity.

The first \ninterview was not part of a seminar for university students writing their \ntheses on trans issues, nor was it a show broadcast only to trans people. \nRequiring the interviewer in a generalized news chat show to be an expert \non the issues they're asking you about, and to know through the magic of \nmind reading to refrain from common word use, is lazy, pointless, and \ncontrary to the whole idea of broad media attention. Doing so after the \nfact, behind their back, to the whole world, is rude to the point of \ncasting a negative light on the whole community she's (hopefully) trying to \nadvocate for.\n\nSupporting a community is NOT the same thing as knowing everything about \nit. Not even all trans people know everything about the trans community. \nSome trans people don't even know what it is to be trans yet. Supporting a \ncommunity means wanting them to have the same rights as everyone else and \nbeing open to being corrected if you say something that offends them. Piers \nMorgan was unequivocally supportive in the first interview.\n\nIs this interview a second platform for Mock to talk about the same things \nas in the first interview? Of course not. The point of the second interview \nis to question why Morgan has to be vilified and hated by the whole trans \ncommunity for Mock to make her points. It's a fair question, and one that \nMock doesn't answer.\n\nIf Mock sidestepped the point she made on twitter because she was too \nnervous or felt too intimidated to point out that he shouldn't say 'born a \nboy', it's odd that she made so many other points and never seemed unable \nto be critical of him. Why the selective silence? And how was Morgan \nsupposed to tell when she was keeping quiet about one thing by making a \ndifferent point or just smiling and waiting for the next question? What \nkind of superpowers exactly do you think go into being a journalist?\n\nAlso, continuously referring to Morgan as 'that white man' really \nundermines your points about symbolic violence."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNXS8SiPoUB92_sEqavvltA", "inappropriate_score": 0.42553191489361702, "authorDisplayName": "john parvin", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z122vzpoeka0wzkfc23vsb2p3ofgtxg4a04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-19T03:37:14.668Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNXS8SiPoUB92_sEqavvltA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.12651600000000002, "formal_score": 52, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-19T03:37:14.668Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101559979085411050254", "textDisplay": "There was absolutely nothing Janet Mock did to provoke the kind of \nignorance and symbolic violence that white man uttered out of his mouth. \nMelissa Harris Perry's interview with Mock is a perfect juxtaposition to \nthese two with Morgan, and it shows the stark difference between a \njournalist who actually read the book and one who obviously didn't. Morgan \nhad a noted activist for trans* rights on the show to explicitly advocate \nfor a book surrounding a larger political need to generate more genuine \nnarratives of trans* lives, particularly the lives of trans women of color, \nand he chose to not read the book and instead lean on countless negative \nand sensationalized tropes about transsexual people for his questions.\n\n From the very beginning, Mock was backed into a corner between maintaining \na positive image as one of few media representations for trans women of \ncolor or speaking out against every single ignorant thing Morgan and his \nshow did. In the end, it shouldn't have been her responsibility to do all \nthe friekin' work of not only producing a positive, TRUE representation of \ntrans* people, but also telling this white man every time he's saying \nsomething ignorant because he forgot to read the goddang book. In fact, I \ndon't believe he made any kind of effort to critically engage with what it \nmeans to be trans* in the US. No, he just kept saying he's \"for gay \nmarriage, for gays, for equality, for transgender rights!\" The only thing \nhe knows about LGBT is the gay marriage movement... and he's equating that \nBASIC position with understanding and allying alongside the struggles of \ntrans* people. Morgan is ridiculous and ignorant, and he did not give her \nenough time to explain the complexities and nuance of the trans* community, \ninstead he just kept demanding there was a proper way for Janet Mock to \nrepresent HER OWN community with all his advice, interruptions, and refusal \nto admit any kind of personal wrongdoing.

Simple!\n\nPiers, you are now experiencing just a taste of what this world will become \nif future generations start regarding sexual deviance as normal.  The day \nwill come when LGBT people will be considered \"untouchable\" which in turn \nwill make them \"superior\" to heterosexual people.  You have been the most \noutspoken and supportive tv personality to this community, however you made \nthe slightest \"mistake\" (according to J Mock) and look how the pay you:  \nWITH ZERO GRATITUDE AND A LOAD OF INSULTS.\n\nNone of this makes any sense at all. It makes sense only to transgender \npeople (apparently) but I don\u00b4t get their logic AT ALL.  They call \nthemselves transgender, but it is wrong to mention that they were born the \nopposite sex.  Again, this is what happens when societies start making up \ntheir own rules.\n\nThere are obvious contradictions in all of this. \n1) They say that you should accept and love yourself just the way you are, \nyet they undergo surgery to alter their bodies.\n\n2) Others say \"Your are born the way God intended you to be\" and that \"God \nmakes no mistakes\", but apparently they think that God does make mistakes, \notherwise they would not change anything.\n\n3) On the flip side of this, some say: \"We have the right to \"control our \nidentities\" (meaning we can change our bodies), however they vilified those \nwho seek to change their sexual orientation.  (Why the double standard?)\n\nWake up people!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2jooGUwpeYn4pF1OrcnJA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "walterygor", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13odxpahw2mxhrbb04chpgjkwyhvllovr00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T01:02:00.692Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCH2jooGUwpeYn4pF1OrcnJA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.25263400000000003, "formal_score": 58, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T01:02:00.692Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100519224544778421047", "textDisplay": "+Paul Brown\n\nThere are good therapists and bad therapists, just as there are good \nsurgeons and bad surgeons. \n\nThe good therapists reject cases in which the patient is not a willing \nparticipant or does not want to change. \n\n "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvedvFMNmQ9JnVl4h32soZw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Paul Brown", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13odxpahw2mxhrbb04chpgjkwyhvllovr00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T00:49:07.709Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvedvFMNmQ9JnVl4h32soZw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.068022000000000027, "formal_score": 84, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T00:49:07.709Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_WGWI44GelQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKY/f1wvYEDiSgE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101375560220989572424", "textDisplay": "+walterygor\ni think the difference is that many \"re orientation therapy\" camps are \ncoercive, whereas sex change operations are elective and in fact people \nface serious barriers in accessing them."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2jooGUwpeYn4pF1OrcnJA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "walterygor", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13odxpahw2mxhrbb04chpgjkwyhvllovr00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T00:36:00.108Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCH2jooGUwpeYn4pF1OrcnJA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.074384000000000006, "formal_score": 16, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T00:36:00.108Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100519224544778421047", "textDisplay": "+Paul Brown\n\nOk, I\u00b4m glad to hear that, and thank you for clarifying it.\n\nNever the less, LGBT lobbyists (which include transgender people) do \ncondemn any kind of sexual re orientation therapy, even when people seek it \nvoluntarily. \n\nThey want to pass laws to prohibit such practices, which I find \ncontradictory because to me a sex-change operation and taking hormones to \nchange your body is a much more dangerous and invasive procedure than \ntherapy, however, nobody says anything against that."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvedvFMNmQ9JnVl4h32soZw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Paul Brown", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13odxpahw2mxhrbb04chpgjkwyhvllovr00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T00:26:45.610Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvedvFMNmQ9JnVl4h32soZw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.069066000000000016, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T00:26:45.610Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_WGWI44GelQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKY/f1wvYEDiSgE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101375560220989572424", "textDisplay": "+walterygor\ni have never heard a trans person condemn that, so yeah, sure.\n\njust keep in mind that not all trans people are the same and don't speak \nwith a single, unified voice on all topics."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2jooGUwpeYn4pF1OrcnJA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "walterygor", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13odxpahw2mxhrbb04chpgjkwyhvllovr00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T00:14:07.617Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCH2jooGUwpeYn4pF1OrcnJA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.37504599999999999, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T00:14:07.617Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100519224544778421047", "textDisplay": "+Paul Brown\n\nNo.  I\u00b4m talking about authentic therapy that people with unwanted same sex \nattractions undergo VOLUNTARILY.\n\nAre transgender people ok with it?

You wouldn't mind talking about surgeries you have had, \nincluding to your genitalia and when you talked about (or disclosed the \nhistory of) your genitalia to your mate or when you became a \"real\" woman? \nDon't you think that 99.999% of the people that watch Piers Morgan know at \nthis point what a transgender transition entails? I think the point is to \nstop talking about the sensationalistic aspects of transition and begin \ntalking about the very real issues the community faces- extremely high \nrates of under or unemployment, discrimination of all sorts including even \nin health care, reduced access to care, astronomically high rates of \nsuicide and violence, including murder. These are the real issues that need \nto be discussed, not the same tired old questions that transpeople are \n*always* asked that are often very personal and one would never ask anyone \nelse in polite company, let alone on national television. \n\nFurthermore, as Janet seemed to try to point out before Piers cut her off \none of many times, sexual orientation and gender identity are different \nissues, so why the constant mentioning of his support for gays? Transpeople \nnever seem to be afforded the opportunity to clear up many of the \nmisconceptions about transition because they are too busy answering \ninvasive, personal questions that few people would want to talk about in \ndetail. Do you know that since Matthew Shepherd was murdered, literally \nHUNDREDS of transwomen have been murdered in this country and around the \nworld? When do transpeople get to define who they are themselves, not be \ndefined by others, and begin to talk about the serious issues facing the \ncommunity, not just the sensationalized \"fluff\" that when directed at you \ncan feel very voyeuristic in nature? These questions are rhetorical and not \nmeant to offend. I just hope they help you and others to understand why so \nmany in the community are fed up with the constant invasive game of twenty \nquestions about our bodies and our pasts, not our work on pressing issues \nfacing the community today."}}]}, "z131f31aptfssd0os04cffq52tbewl0a1mo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkxu_7V2BfmtnYu4G3RaaQg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "kosmoran", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T07:10:05.282Z", "videoId": "0F8WiuxYoE4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkxu_7V2BfmtnYu4G3RaaQg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.21300999999999998, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T07:10:05.282Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104675337823231598383", "textDisplay": "To everyone here showing hate for trans people: you'll all be subject of \nridicule in a couple more decades and will probably regret what you said - \nif you're still alive.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkxu_7V2BfmtnYu4G3RaaQg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "kosmoran", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z131f31aptfssd0os04cffq52tbewl0a1mo0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T08:06:23.595Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkxu_7V2BfmtnYu4G3RaaQg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.90214030000000001, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T08:06:23.595Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104675337823231598383", "textDisplay": "+Junii Waves not really, but you do sound like you felt threatened, lol"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr6K0Ge9PE_Xz5jUeJJ-6aw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Junii Waves", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z131f31aptfssd0os04cffq52tbewl0a1mo0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T19:08:43.687Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCr6K0Ge9PE_Xz5jUeJJ-6aw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.57105000000000006, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T19:08:43.687Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HmdwOOkzFFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAkM/TiHzQLOt8P8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117539486013618143126", "textDisplay": "Wow.. is that a threat? lol."}}]}, "z12gxhkpxxaexh1nq22pcdexhzydtfhww04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 8, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBuuRloP5OKXrd7FOSjeq-w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vj3OogFNP2Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAY4/lABENjSWuf4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.4492753623188406, "authorDisplayName": "Katie Orlowski", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T04:23:45.943Z", "videoId": "0F8WiuxYoE4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBuuRloP5OKXrd7FOSjeq-w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.90345149999999996, "formal_score": 16, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T04:23:45.943Z", "likeCount": 8, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100282611691334588402", "textDisplay": "I was gonna post my opinion here, but the amount of transphobia in these \ncomments is literally so fucking disgusting.

Also, keep in mind observation bias. All the trans folks that \ndidn't care about this historical misgendering weren't on twitter or here \ntelling you all about it, because they, well, don't care. \n\nIt was illegal for men to crossdress as women into the 1970's in places. \nThe history of transgender rights and law is quite interesting and things \nare truly moving at pace these days. \n\n\"It seems most transexuals were brought up by guardians who had a strict \nsense of what men can do and what women can do...\" It's quite mixed in my \nexperience. If you have a source, of course, I'll read it. Keep in mind \nthis is of course more true in the past for older trans folks as there \nsimply was more sexism and more rigid gender roles in the past in all parts \nof society, not just their parents. \n\n\"If the trans community is arguing that taking on the role of a woman is \nall that makes one a woman...\" The trans community is generally arguing for \nself identification. You're a woman if you say you're a woman, period. The \nlegal establishment's test for gender marker change is generally more \nphysical. While it may be possible to have a doctor write you a letter with \nno medical intervention, most would require hormone treatments at a \nminimum. Other states require surgery. At least one state doesn't allow any \nlegal gender marker change at all. This case rather humorously brings the \nhypocrisy together:\n\nhttp://www.wate.com/story/16039917/morristown-transgendered-woman-says-she-went-topless-to-make-a-statement\n\nIn your description I saw more of a focus on GRS and parts. Hormones are \nincredibly powerful too and I wouldn't leave them out of your calculus. \nMany trans people, and particularly transmen (for a number of reasons), \ndon't have GRS. Testosterone really works a treat for transmen. The \ntransformation is rapid and fairly breathtaking.  \n\nIf you care this much about the topic, why not read Janet's book? It's \nprobably the best trans memoir, with Boylan's book being a close second. \nThis readable primer on the intersection of gender and the transgender by a \nscience writer at Johns Hopkins University is also very good. \n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Riddle-Gender-Deborah-Rudacille/dp/0385721978/"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY0FfMZEx3cvRUBmc4QoxrA", "inappropriate_score": 0.1737619461337967, "authorDisplayName": "TheSLMTube", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12zh3t5sm3ptn0yx04cdduizkuydxyrm2g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-05T04:56:30.968Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCY0FfMZEx3cvRUBmc4QoxrA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.18369999999999997, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-05T05:02:17.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ucRuGPO91CI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADU/QGu7k4GyMqw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107313887001567787956", "textDisplay": "+exnihilo415 It's not so much the effort involved (in this particular case- \nhowever, I do think it's a slippery slope that could lead to eggshells \neverywhere) as the drastic consequences for using the wrong word (in Piers \ncase, being vilified by the entire community). \n\nAs a community, the trans folk didn't seem very understanding of this Piers \ninterview.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, many people don't and won't believe Janet wasn't \nmale when she was born, others don't believe she wasn't male when she \nstarted 'dressing, acting, and being referred to as a girl,' and others \nstill believe she remains male.\nI myself have left all my researching over the past week or two less sure \nof where I stand. It may be because I live in a major city where people of \nall types, sexual preferences, styles, attitudes, and outlooks openly walk \nthe streets, but- we're not in the 1920's where men couldn't wear pink (or \ndresses and skirts for that matter), stay home and take care of kids, never \ncry or play with barbies, be sexually penetrated etc... a man can be as \nfeminine as any female, and vice versa (granted, wearing a skirt would \nlimit job opportunities etc... [just like being trans]). If 'gender' is \njust a cultural role generally attached to one's 'sex,' that attachment \nseems to have deteriorated so much that one can be a \"woman\" (to speak in \nthis gender-sensitive way) while still being \"male\" (I would actually go so \nfar as to say \"man,\" and the confusion there would be part of my point). It \nseems most transexuals were brought up by guardians who had a strict sense \nof what men can do and what women can do... a way of looking at the world \nthat seems to me to be becoming passe (Again, I live in the city). I didn't \neven realize I behave like a 'woman' at times until I started this \nresearch... to me a woman had always just been an adult biological female \n(with cultural pressures of shaving legs etc) until I was exposed to this \ntrans stuff- and I never thought it was a big deal- sure, you got a vag \nyou're a girl, whoop-dee-doo... but with all this controversy I'm thinking \nabout it more. If the trans community is arguing that taking on the role of \na woman is all that makes one a woman then there are a shitload of women \nwith penises who think they're men in this city. I'm no longer convinced \nthat taking on the role of a woman and getting genital surgery makes a man \na woman.\nBut the thing is- I don't think it's important. I don't think someone like \nJanet should be offended if someone like me called her man. It doesn't \nchange who she (or he) is, and it doesn't change the fact that I could \nappreciate her (or his) existence, even be sexually attracted to her (or \nhim) and respect everything about her/him other than the fact that we \ndisagree on a subject which he/she happens to hold dear- her/his \n'womanhood.'\n\nIn the end it seems this argument is about definitions and semantics, which \nis really quite trying and boring to argue about. And I don't think there \nshould be such passion behind it.

A gender \nreassignment surgery, but it's still the same gender so there actually was \nno change. I was a man but wasn't a MAN, man. It was a transition... but \nwait, i didn't transit anywhere so it was nothing. nothing happened.'\nI don't see why it's so offensive to say a trans person was 'once a boy' \nbut had 'a sex change.' But maybe it is offensive, if that's the case there \nneeds to be another way to describe the change. But to talk of EVERY case \nuniquely using different language for every person is absurd, imagine if \neveryone started organizing the language that could be used when \nreferencing their own personal history- it's not only ridiculous, it's \nunfair. Under the guise of seeking equality, a trans person that wants this \ntype of treatment is actually setting themselves apart from the rest of the \nworld.\n\nIt seems that in Janet Mock's case, she doesn't want people to refer to her \nas 'male at birth,' in her words she was rather 'a (non-sex) baby at \nbirth,' but biological science says she WAS male at birth. Maybe she finds \nthe word 'male' offensive because to her it implies a cultural role... \nMaybe it's something she needs to get over, because it seems theres \nactually NO language that is acceptable and exact. Can we just say, 'when \nyour penis was chopped off'?' I mean, that's literally what happened... it \nsounds much more offensive to me, but does that work? And describe a trans' \nlife history as either \"P.P.C\" or \"A.P.C\". (\"Pre Penis Chop\" & \"After Penis \nChop\"), or does the word penis carry too much cultural ballast as well?\n\nWe need a shared language that can describe these sorts of changes. There \nare two solutions- certain trans people need to get over their reservations \nagainst using certain words, or, if, as a community, we find merit in the \ndiscontent with using any words currently in the English language to \ndescribe these changes, we create a new word(s) to account for that.

It is a New York Times bestseller \nfor a reason.  \n\nI didn't mean to presume any feelings about your gender but it was the only \nway I could think of to try to make a personal and understandable analogy \nabout the passionate way Janet views her gender over her biological sex. \nOther folks don't have this same level of interest or passion about their \nown physiology or presentation. Some people identify as agender, gender \nfluid, neutrois, for these very reasons.\n\nThank you for the conversation, Dunam.

Mock should have let this slide, but instead she invented this \ncontroversy and probably succeeded in selling more books because of it. \nMock could have even taken the approach of educating Morgan about the \ncorrect terminology to use and how to correctly reference the aspects \ninvolved in being transgender, but no, she had to make a big scene out of \nit.\n\nA once respected and impressive community has suddenly become a sensitive, \nungracious community in my eyes by making such a big deal out of an honest \nmistake. Maybe if Morgan had a discussion with Mock about the correct \nsemantics to be used when referring the surgery etc., this could have all \nbeen avoided.

Who says that they were born a baby and was assigned a male \nat birth? Who says this? It's bizarre. If I'm not mistaken when a person is \nborn the junk between ones legs that determines gender. No one unfairly \nassigns gender or misgendered as he calls it. What this man did to Piers \nwas unfair and he threw a temper tantrum for pointing out the fact that he \nwas a male. You can put lipstick on a pig and call it a woman but it is \nstill a pig, you can change your appearance from that of a man to a woman \nbut you will always be a man. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKeVZri01qPvDfX5Sw2Lpmw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Robert Carrillo", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13rzd2w2pinyltye04cdh2xmzj1yx4rutk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-21T22:12:45.786Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKeVZri01qPvDfX5Sw2Lpmw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.5920700000000001, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-21T22:12:45.786Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107923615599878597154", "textDisplay": "+exnihilo415 This dude wanted the interview to go his way.

He simply said that she was a boy that transformed into \na woman and that is completely correct ( in other words she had a male body \nbut transitioned her body into a female body). Janet was born a \"baby\" boy \nbecause her physical body was male (though her soul has always been female) \nand then she transitioned to have her physical body that matches her inner \nsoul, which was woman. is there anything that Piers said that can be \ndisputed? I am really disappointed at her  because sometimes in our \ncommunity (whether Transgendered or in any community such as Gay, Lesbian, \nand bisexual) we don't give enough credit to those who genuinely support us \nlike piers morgan does and its' a shame because it makes people who are \ntrying to do right feel as though their support and help to make a \ncommunity more heard is pointless. As i said before, I wish the best for \nJanet and will continue to support her because she's apart of the LGBT \ncommunity but I do believe that people should be more careful in what we \nsay to not go backwards in the movement that we desire for our community.

Yes, odds are near 100% that she has XY chromosomes.\n\nGender is much more complicated than that. I'm going to go a little off \ntopic, but stick with me.\n\nHave you heard of intersex persons? They are people who through some \ncombination of hormones, chromosomes, and physical genitalia don't fit into \nbinary, easy to classify definitions of gender.\n\nAn example of this is a person who is biologically XY but can't process \ntestosterone. When this person grows up, outwardly they appear female. \nBreasts, labia. They spend their early childhoods raised as girls. However, \nthey will never have periods or give birth to children. Their internal \ngenitals are not a uterus, but a penis that never developed enough to drop.\n\nLooking at this clinically we have one piece of information that says male, \none that says female. The bigger picture has this person qualify as neither.\n\nSo how do we classify this person? This is where gender comes in.\n\nDoes this person identify with the girl label of their childhood? Or do \nthey think male is a better fit for them. Their chromosomes say so. Or \nneither, another possibility.\n\nSituations like this really open up this idea that gender is not the same \nas sex. Gender is about self identity.\n\nLike homosexuality, history is full of people who have lived by different \ngenders then those assigned to them at birth. Whether by necessity or \nchoice, these decisions had a huge impact on their lives.\n\nIt's okay if you don't understand, just know this.\n1) Janet is happier as a woman.\n\n2) No harm comes from this. All arguments that I have heard making that \ncase sound very similar to \"gays ruin everything.\"\n\n3) This does not threaten your sexuality.\n\nIf you meet a guy in the future with a clit instead of a cock and that's a \ndeal breaker, that's okay. If you are still sexually attracted to them, \nthat's okay.\n\nIt's similar to how some lesbians enjoy strap ons and others don't. It's \nmore bedroom compatibility then sexual identity crisis."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb5mK5Ts0YLP5rk7ZUeJGgg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "rainmaker6261", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ddnjibsi2xbk5i04cdbaiisqzybmwncs", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-31T02:49:29.577Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCb5mK5Ts0YLP5rk7ZUeJGgg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.79187000000000007, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-01-31T02:49:29.577Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108631815352427778406", "textDisplay": "+Surprisingly Blank she was biologically male.

The article was written in the \nfirst person, and if you read it, which I have, it sounds as if it came out \nof her mouth. To split hairs by insisting that someone else wrote down her \nwords is disingenuous at best. But to take Piers to task for citing the \narticle is just ridiculous and petty. Anyone who read that article would \nclearly construe those were her words. And if the article were such a big \nissue for her, then why wasn't she and the community twitter-bombing Marie \nClaire for the past two years?\n\nShe was born male. The whole \"Trans\" label indicates a transition from one \nincarnation to another, that is part of who she is, and it should be \ncelebrated. This construct of having a \"sex assigned to you\" is a nuance \nthat the majority of mainstream does not understand. To insist that \"she \nwas never a...boy\" is again playing to the radical trans community and \nmakes little sense to the mainstream. One day they may get it, but to dwell \non this now and insist that it is a \"misgendered label\" just \ndisenfranchises the community by coming off as too militant, and way to \npicayune. IT'S NOT THE POINT. The point is that she is NOW a woman, and has \nidentified as female for almost her whole life, and should be accepted as \nsuch REGARDLESS of whatever classification people want to make when she is \nborn. GET PAST IT (for now).\n\nPiers Morgan is one of the most liberal talking heads with a substantial \naudience. Janet Mock missed an opportunity to leverage the megaphone that \nPiers was willing to provide her. Instead of seeing the big picture of his \ngenerosity and support she chose to hyper focus on one tiny statement, \nwhich was the HEADLINE OF THE ARTICLE IN MARIE CLAIRE. Instead she came off \nas petty and rude, as well as classless with her nasty tweets. My \nprediction is that Janet Mock becomes yesterday's news in less than the 15 \nminutes he afforded her.

Trans is not wrong or unnatural. Oh poor A and \nB people, who can only see A and B, they need to study quantum physics! God \n\"TRANS\"itioned to become human-Jesus. Something God was not before, that \nis, male in the singular carnal human form, because we all know God claims \nto be the Alpha and the Omega, not one or the other, but all and both. God \nhas ultimate power over creation and form. God is not Isolated and \nrestricted to one form or the other. Otherwise becoming Jesus and that \nmission on earth would never have been possible and there would be no \nresurrection also. God is a trans being in the ultimate meaning of that \nword \"TRANS\" without limit and without beginning or end. The truths lie \nwithin the stories. And this truth does not depend on whether the story is \nliterally true or not.\n\nGod created us in God's image, all people are male and female. God never \nsaid I create you in my image, male's image, or in my image female's image. \nThis is further hinted at juring the creation or Adam, God created \nAdam, and made Eve from a rib in Adam. Eve was in Adam before Adam even \nknew it. And there is no male before female or female before male. They \nwere both, then, fundamentally created at the same time in one. Logical \nsince we are a creation coming from that which is the alpha and the omega. \nAdam is Eve and Eve is Adam.\n\nWhich could also in an alternative view be the universe. The universe is \nall! And we are literally stars, It's important to realize the same atoms \nin a rock, a tree and more are the same atoms in you and me! Yep we are an \nexample of the universe's \"I Am\". We are matter that is conscious. We are \nmatter and energy aware of itself, matter asking what is matter. \nAnd damn you if you think you have the right to control the universe's \nconscious reflection of itself and what it is. And you'd be a fool to think \nwe are the only examples of the universe's \"I Am\". When the universe is an \nincomprehensible endless mathematical entity of size and odds, we're just \ngrasshoppers claiming we can hop to Neptune.\n\nOk, now lets start with, \"The universe's nature = \"trans\" Bi + beyond, \nmultiples of multiples, however you want it, but certainly not just, either \nA or either B. Basics of proven relativity and Quantum mechanics.\n\"The formless form\", E=mc2, The equal sign in this equation indicates that \nmatter can be converted into energy and vice versa, M=E and E=M, to quote \nthe creator of this famous equation, his words. \"Both but different \nmanifestations of the same thing\"! Hmm sound like the Adam and Eve story. \nDifferent manifestations of the same thing. I'm very sorry to say but we \nare made up of matter and energy at its very foundation and core. That will \nhave none of the, this or only that, here or only there, everything is only \nA and B complex!\n\nQuantum physics the study of levels in the tiny invisible world. And the \nstudy of the atoms and particles that make us and give us a foundation and \npossibility to exist. Well their nature which is also ours throws the rules \nout the window. You can do experiments backed by math and light says I'm \nparticles. Then you can do experiments also backed by solid math, light \nanswers, no I'm waves. This leads to the measurement issue in this science. \nAnd you can only know where a particle is when you measure it or observe \nit. A particle can be in 3 places at the same time, without being any where \nat all. Oh the lovely stuff that is us which gives us possibility and life. \nOur entire foundational essence is these atoms, particles, waves, energy \nand consciousness. And all of them behave in this, 2 in one, or Im here and \nthere, Im this and that, Im multipule and simultaneous manner. Is it any \nwonder these things manifest in us! What is natural within, will be \nnatural throughout.\n\nNow we're touching the measurement issue. If we leave the QP world and come \nback to just physics we have general relativity and special relativity to \nhelp us make sense of the universe and the measurement issue. It's basicly \nall relative. My observation and your observation are both valid even \nthough they are different perceptions of reality. Relativity 101. We have a \nflatbed truck going 100km an hour down the road, steady. On that flatbed is \na pitcher, catcher and a guy with a radar gun. On the side of the road is \nanother guy with a radar gun, The pitcher throws a ball at 50km an hour, \nour guy with the radar gun on the truck gets a reading of 50km, the ball \nwent 50 km, valid! Now the guy on the road takes his reading, his gun \nmeasures 150km, also valid.\n\nNow minus everything around the ball as it has its moment alone moving \nthrough space. The same ball travelling through the same space has bi \nmeasurments which are both true. In relativity 101 it is easy for us to \nunderstand the mathematics invloved here. Wether the observer is human or a \nradar gun. Though at this more understandable level we can observe with our \nown eyes the possibilities when looking at the ball of one matter \ntravelling through one space. Dual, trans or bi measurements. But wait the \nball is also not just one and not just solid matter. It is vibrating energy \nof open space. On our level of perception it is solid, but when you zoom in \nand into that solid it becomes particles, waves, energy and atoms. If you \nwere the nucleus of an atom. You could have an electron out about 1km away \nfrom you.\n\nWell, you are all that, but consciousness is fed back reflecting on it in a \ndifferent dimension where we live our daily lives, but its still like \nthat. The ball's multiples of multiples, movements, atoms, particles all \nmoving in a different dimension of space that avoid us pinning them down. \nThe space as Einsten said, is one but not one, it's the 3 dimensions of \nspace and the single dimension of time bound together in a single fabric of \nspace-time. And there could be 10 dimensions, and maybe string theory in \nthe 11th dimension. Do I really need to go on. Even if you want to ignore \nthe God stuff. Science is pretty unanimous on the nature of the \nuniverse which is the nature of us humans, it's anything but strictly A \nand B. Last time I checked the universe has been around for a mathematical \ntime you can't comprehend. Us humans, not even a quantum fraction of \nmovement in the beginning of a blink of an eye compared to that.\n\nThe universe. We are wrapped up in the endlessness of it. We are it and its \nnature is us. And we will always be free to the possibilities and \nreflections of what we can be and do. It is only with such incomprehensible \nodds of possibility that is the universe. That we are even here in the \nfirst place. And if you think you own this process and get to say who is \ndoing it wrong or right. Or who belongs here or not. Think again! That's \nwhy we have the Reaper with his sickle, he removes all from this place \nwithout any bias, and you're not exempt. Heck your number could be up \ntomorrow and even if you did live a full life, still a fraction of a \nblink compared to the universe and future conscious beings coming down the \nline. You don't own this world or conscious realm. So be a little humble, \nand don't judge with hate. Side with the odds of the universe. You never \nknow where its going to decide to pop up consciousness next, what realm? \nWhat reality? What planet? Or part of the universe... or for that matter, \nwhat body? Trans is not wrong or unnatural, its the universe!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13qdz2xpziuhnome224e3ub1oexznol1": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCbTC9Hqs3wPKE-jklbva3Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-PQK0uOS6dO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADk/m2adFfNfsMw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 5.4054054054054053, "authorDisplayName": "Tom Moran", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-14T11:15:38.914Z", "videoId": "0F8WiuxYoE4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCbTC9Hqs3wPKE-jklbva3Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.51374000000000009, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-02-14T11:15:38.914Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114993712823118150195", "textDisplay": "fuck that bitch, when you change gender why not take the best from that \ngender instead of the worst? \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z121cdlhxwaoyzmuo23dcddbrnfwc50es": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiPh7X-mC9DIneTfQVYqPIQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "thesaintseiya02", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-06T23:42:25.400Z", "videoId": "0F8WiuxYoE4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCiPh7X-mC9DIneTfQVYqPIQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.34065799999999996, "formal_score": 8, "updatedAt": "2014-02-06T23:42:25.400Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116037234542263012444", "textDisplay": "I think people are really not understanding what she's trying to get at, \nbut she is not making herself very clear either.

Gender to \nme is the same as it is to Janet, It's a societal construct, and and \nidentity that we do have to discover and define ourselves, but the fact of \nthe matter is she was still born with MALE SEX.\n\nI loved the first interview and so applauding Janet, until this new video \ncame out. Her body language was defensive, and closed. She is a one sided \nminded person and It very visible that it's her beliefs, and her ideals or \nyou are a bigoted ignorant asshole. \n\n\nJanet please look over this video, You have offended your own community. \nand you really need to meditate and reflect on your approach for advocating \nfor us. Cause as you said you are protecting and fighting for us but this \nsheer ignorantness on YOUR behalf has done nothing but disappointed. You \nwill not get my money for your book. I do not advocate an activist who uses \nsuch low grade tactics as igniting a flame war, and villanizing someone. As \nI said i wasn't even a fan of piers, but over this video the respect you \nwere given was spat on by your responses, talking, and utterly shitty body \nlanguage that was present in this video.

Isaac\n\ufeff\nThe entire world other than a very small percentage of people are very \nclear of what a male and female is. We do not need to redefine them as \nalmost everyone in the entire planet knows what they mean. You are born \neither male or female unless you happen to be a true hermophrodite which is \na separate issue. The genitalia is the first sign of what will come for the \nfuture of the person, so it is key in distinguishing this at birth, but the \nperson will then grow up to be a full fledged male or female, which is \ndefined by many traits, not only genitalia. Genitalia is just the first \nkey. A man can have his penis and balls chopped off, he is still a guy. \nBecause when Janet was a man, felt that he was really a she, she had to \nundergo a complete artificial transformation to appear as a woman. \nNaturally this could not be done. She still was born a male. Her, you and \nothers like this, seems to be overly obsessed with gender roles. Saying \"I \nalways knew I was a woman inside\" I do not even know what this means. \nGender is defined by what you are physically. Saying gender is defined by \nwhat you feel, is so absurd. Janet has proven it is all based on physical, \nas if it only mattered what she felt like inside, then why get the surgery \nin the first place? Why do men and woman need to feel one way or the other \nall of the time anyway? How you think, feel or conduct your life, is \nentirely up to the person and they do not have to follow strict doctrine of \ngender roles if they do now want to. When people say \"male\" or \"female\" we \ndo not mean every gender has to specifically fit into a mold. So Janet mock \nwants to be seen as a woman and I respect that. But she was born a male, \nbecause gender is what you are physically, then artificially transformed to \nhave the body and the voice of a woman, and worked really hard to learn the \nmannerisms of a woman, to become what he felt is the stereotype of a \nfemale. But all I see is a guy under all of that makeup, hormones and \nsurgery. But, she wants to be considered a woman, so I consider her a \nwoman. She has the freedom to do what she wants to her body. But to say \ngender is assigned is just ludicrous and you are not going to find enough \npeople to support that cause. It's too bad people don't focus more on who \nthey are inside which is beyond male or female instead of obsessing on \nstereotypical gender roles."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdt-QaLLPuuX2gd8fEFQjpw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "T.

You have every right \nto feel however you want to about that. \n\nPiers doesn't really want to know what it's like to be transgender. He just \nwants to lecture us about what a supporter and ally he is, all the while he \nisn't actually listening to what she wants nor did he read her book. \nSupport actually requires a degree of humility that he lacks. That said, he \nprobably will be more willing to ask how trans people want to be referred \nto in past tense going forward. That's the point. Mission accomplished.

I know the likelihood of you ever \nseeing this comment is about as great as me winning the lottery, but...

Yeah, I think everyone is scared, especially in the public eye- \nI mean, obviously studies have shown that more people are more afraid of \npublic speaking than being buried alive or drowning! I know that's morbid \nbut it's true. Nevertheless, if you're going to put yourself out there, \ndon't be using that as your excuse to play the victim where no victim even \nexists... except after the fact in this case- I feel more like Piers was \nthe victim... \n\nI'm glad he's still on CNN. I really hope his ratings go back up because I \nreally like him and I love how open-minded he is. He's a brilliant man and \na decent talk-show host although he could use some diction classes so the \nlay-viewer can understand him more clearly. I think that might be the main \nreason he has had a ratings drop. He's hard to understand because sometimes \nhis accent is just so thick even I can't understand it and I'm very well \nversed in the different British and UK accents... it's usually when he gets \nexcited and starts speaking really really fast. \n\nBut that's beside the point. Anyway, no... Janet doesn't look like a scared \nANYTHING... just a typical example of what the trans community needs the \nopposite of. Too may \"ACTIVISTS\" (Laverne Cox non-included here, of course) \nare too defensive about cis-gender people's use of pronouns when speaking \nabout their past or present. As a trans/intersex woman myself (not that I \nLOVE being so, but I can't deny it so... I'll just own it), I don't get \nhung up on the pronoun debacles. People are HUMAN! They make mistakes and \ndon't understand... ESPECIALLY something as complicated as gender identity \ndisorders and why people transition and how to deal with that. In all \nhonesty... in our society, growing in education though it may be, people \nSTILL have a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG way to go to even scratching the SURFACE of \nunderstanding the complexities of gender and abnormalities therein. \n\nAs part of a gender-dichotomy-focused society for millennia, you simply \ncan't just EXPECT people who AREN'T transgender to fully understand such \ncomplexities... even after studying the phenomena in depth. It's just too \ncomplex an issue and I think there are just too many trans (especially \nwomen) out there who are just too tightly-wound about their expectations of \nthe cisgender-world understanding every nuance of what it is to BE \ntransgender. \n\nI just think Piers did a phenomenal job in the initial interview... \ninasmuch as a cisgender male talk-show host can... and was accosted for not \nbeing the expert of all experts. I mean HE'S NOT GOD for crying out loud! \nSo... I'm REALLY ashamed to be lumped into a community with people like \nJanet Mock who berate people for simply being human... and behind their \nbacks, no less. How petty!

I also think that it is quite sad that she does not \nappreciate the significance of acknowledging her previous state of being as \na boy: if she really is trying to be a role model for those who wish to \nchange from one gender to the other, then surely she would want to help \nthem to better understand the transition one goes through to achieve what \nthey want to be - denying your previous gender will only further jeopardise \nthis matter, especially for young people, for whom it is so crucial that \nthey can understand the transitions they may make as a transgender \nman/woman.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12fvpgw0rfpupdrq04cj32q0oa2ztcrmwo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUd4kHbP2pxVVoaVyUSr68g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "phillydogg1", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-06T20:56:44.124Z", "videoId": "0F8WiuxYoE4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUd4kHbP2pxVVoaVyUSr68g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.86721629999999994, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-02-06T20:56:44.124Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117632754988295877379", "textDisplay": "I'm on Piers' side for this one.

Reading it takes \nabout five minutes.  This is not rocket science, Morgan just didn't bother \nto *try* is all.\n\nAnd if being corrected turns him into an \"enemy\", he was never a real ally \nto begin with.

How much of that \nairtime should she have sacrificed to correct Morgan's ignorance?  Her \nfifteen minutes on that show is much more precious to her than to him, \nbecause he's the host and will be there tomorrow and the next day.  She \njust gets those fifteen minutes (she didn't know at the time that there'd \nbe a second interview).

My \nguess is, in the heat of that moment, she weighed the alternatives and made \nthe flash decision:  let it go, can't afford to waste the time or take the \nrisk.

It's because she was a boy who \nbecame a girl. The only way to get rid of gender specific terms is to get \nrid of gender altogether. The reason Janet is considered transgender is \nprecisely because she was a boy as a child. If using the term boy is wrong, \nthen using the term transgender would be wrong too. My point is, this is \njust semantics game. How is Janet suppose to raise consciousness about this \nissue if she is so stigmatized by a word like boy?

I never said I believe in being gay I said that \nis some ones choice. My beliefs are not up for debate. See it's people like \nyou who are so scared of what they really are they try to jump genders just \nto avoid being called GAY. If you are born a MAN and like a MAN no matter \nwhat you change physically about yourself you're still GAY. I can also link \nthe definition of gay if you need it.\n****Now lastly to touch on your syndrome. In rare cases like one who is \nborn a hermaphrodite as example would not be considered gay or a man or a \nwomen until it picked a gender and it if never did then he/she would be \nboth.\n****In conclusion, you can disregard all the facts, change it around in \nyour head, and in the end I have not put my personal judgment on any of \nthis. I have only simply stated scientific facts. It makes no difference to \nme if a MAN LIKES MEN dress like a MAN or a WOMEN in the end it's still a \nMAN with a MAN. That is all this is about and you have jumped so many \ntopics to stay away from the main point of the video.

I think she may not like this gender labelling, but the problem is \nthat this is what gender labelling has always been like i.e. based on \nbiology.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12rhdhglkzchdyz404ce3vonry1up3jpvk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 5, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSNp0EdKo828WoAmgoj-j8w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IAEcWLV3jOM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABg/UsYVHiLKUEg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.9867549668874172, "authorDisplayName": "Tweedweeb", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T00:45:42.577Z", "videoId": "0F8WiuxYoE4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCSNp0EdKo828WoAmgoj-j8w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46352400000000005, "formal_score": 5, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T00:45:54.000Z", "likeCount": 20, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114837942909395699800", "textDisplay": "Piers is so disgustingly ignorant and so are all the people in the comments \ndefending his fallacies.

He continually brought up that \"Marie Claire\" article \nregardless of how many times Janet explained that she did not write that \narticle. About 90% of the time Janet was talking, Piers interrupted her and \ncompletely ignored her point (most of the time to bring up that stupid \narticle). Piers did not host this interview so he could be educated. He \nhosted this interview because he wanted to appear as this saintly \nvictimized martyr. I have no doubt that in his first interview Piers had \nthe best of intentions, but in this one he had a very clear agenda and it \ncertainly wasn't to be educated by Janet. Perhaps it wasn't best for Janet \nto take to twitter to voice her frustrations rather than confront Piers \ndirectly (though it should be noted that Janet REPEATEDLY said that she \nwasn't vilifying Piers but rather vilifying the transphobic way the show \nwas packaged and Piers REPEATEDLY ignored this), but it was definitely a \ncowardly move to take to the air to confront her on this rather than \nspeaking to Janet personally. Piers needs to understand that, as a cis-het \nwhite upper middle class man, he has a huge position of privilege and power \nover Janet and she has every right to be afraid to correct him in her first \ninterview. Along with this, Janet wanted the initial interview to focus on \nher book and not the idea that she was \"formerly a man\", so it is \nunderstandable that she would wait until after the interview to defend \nherself against this. It's a shame that Piers wouldn't shut up for five \nminutes to let Janet explain this, because I do think it's deeply important \nthat someone in his position of power understand that the trans* movement \nis about accepting tans* people for the men and women they are now rather \nthan degrading them to the genitalia they were born with. I do hope that in \nfuture conversations with Janet and other trans* people Piers will focus on \nlearning how to become a better ally rather than attacking anyone who \nopposes him.\nSorry this is so long and jumbled (it's like 2am where I am) but TL;DR: A \ntoddler may ask for orange juice, but that does not mean they will drink it"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_5qQT8-6H8ZXehAbGfLuw", "inappropriate_score": 1.3698630136986301, "authorDisplayName": "NightfallGemini", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12rhdhglkzchdyz404ce3vonry1up3jpvk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T04:41:47.556Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCG_5qQT8-6H8ZXehAbGfLuw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.56829400000000008, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T04:41:47.556Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109191437082609281943", "textDisplay": "Also, since SJWs are catty as all hell I'm sure you'll find some issue with \nthe truth I'm speaking, throw some silly insult my way and then go back to \nworshipping Tumblr Elemental Janet."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_5qQT8-6H8ZXehAbGfLuw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "NightfallGemini", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12rhdhglkzchdyz404ce3vonry1up3jpvk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T04:40:54.424Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCG_5qQT8-6H8ZXehAbGfLuw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.58871800000000007, "formal_score": 45, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T04:40:54.424Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109191437082609281943", "textDisplay": "Well, he tried to learn firsthand.

Look it up.\nBeing trans has to do with development in the womb. Look it up.\nBeing trans has to do with chemicals that are out of balance in the brain. \nMuch like depression and even something as simple as attraction.\nThe thing that makes your gender what it is, is not your genitals. It's not \nyour chromosomes. \nWhat would you tell a cisgendered woman who happens to have a XXY \nchromosome? Would you call her a man and disrespect her? Would you think of \nher as a man simply because she has an extra Y chromosome that is just \nsitting there doing nothing to her physical apperance or to her genitals?\n\nPeople are quick to gender their car and call it a \"she\". People are quick \nto gender America, calling the country a \"she\". They will correct people \nwhen they use the wrong pronoun but they cannot use a simple pronoun and \ncall someone a \"she\" when she's a human being? It's disgusting.\n\nI suggest you look into gender binary classes and educate yourself. I'm not \nsaying this from a place of hate but from a place of \"trying to make you a \nbetter person\". If you do not want to realise your own shortcomings and \nmake a change for your fellow humans, then there is nothing more I can do.

''Nigger\" and \"Negro\" started as \"a \nneutral words\" and using them back then didn't imply the \"unambiguously \nracial slur\" it is today (paraphrasing here the wikipedia page of the word \nas source to not derive this debate on race issues later on). People who \nwere unaware of its pejorative nature and didn't use it that way  weren't \nsuddenly working against the black cause and weren't any more or less \nclose-minded or open-minded people on the issue. As a matter of fact, \nMartin Luther King used these very words himself in a non-pejorative manner \nto advocate the cause. Some people in his entourage might not have agreed \non it, but he had a different belief on that. That goes to show how \nlanguage and causes are two very distinct things, which both you and her \nmake the mistake of mixing, and figthing dogmatic beliefs and being \ntolerant on difference is exactly what progressives want.\n\nShe is advocating that ''boy'' is pejorative word. It is her belief, and \nthat belief that is shared by lots of people believing in the ''Gender \nTheory\", but far from all. It is not shared by the totality of scientists \nthat are on the casse, the linguists and all people from the LGBTQ \ncommunity, and the theory which is, as the name imply, a theory isn't even \nknown to the general public. Clearly, you cannot accuse him of anything by \nthe use of it here, especially when their discourses is on the same \nwave-length otherwise.  She could have taken the time to explain it, but \nshe didn't. She rather tried to dismiss him behind his back and he called \nher on that bullshit.\n\nHave I untangled this enough or should I continue to explain the mistake of \nher way?\n\n You're implying consciously or subconsciously  that  simply because she's \nadvocating a good cause that she's irreproachable and untouchable on how \nshe does it, and that's a logical fallacy, and that isn't up to personal \ndefinition of the connotations of words."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCynRV7ZuYVSDsxJDogwuLog", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "S\u00e9bastien Quevillon", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z121xtgphlicgjtyh04cfjpwpqapz5qjt10", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T17:08:18.327Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCynRV7ZuYVSDsxJDogwuLog"}, "sentiment_score": -0.53451599999999999, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T17:21:43.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VUndirfSm2g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACTM/RVCjKJncujA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110249799023128764004", "textDisplay": "''Are you people for real?\"\n\nReally?

I have no problem with those interested in \npeople born with one gender/sex and discover at a later time, that the body \nthey possess needs to be modified to coincide with what they perceive their \ntrue gender/sex  to be. I am not one and there are millions like me.I \nconsider the issue to be personal thing with no requirements for public \ndisclosure. If a individual born with a penis and was classified as male at \nbirth, chose to modify his body and appearance to that of a female, that's \nhis business. The only person that needs to know is the person that the \nindividuals is going to get intimate with. A straight man assuming an \nindividual to be  a normal female, might not be happy that he didn't know \nbefore hand, that he was fucking a modified man. Is there a community of \nmen with small penises? I bet there is.  Most men would welcome an extra \ninch or two. Do they go public with this issue, stating that bigger isn't \nalways better? No! If every screwed up issue that affects mankind should be \nthe burden of society, there wouldn't be time  to focus on anything else.  \nWe are all queers of one kind or another. Why should either one or two \ngroups think they have a monopoly on strangeness?  If a man want to fuck \nanother man and thinks its normal, more power to him. If a man want to fuck \na goat and thinks it normal, I guess he should also be given cable and \nnetwork time for public disclosure of his passion for farm animals. It \nfucking crazy world we live in. Its difficult to accept established norms \nand with the passage of time, more crap is being increasingly piled on?

You do not speak for all other cisgender people. \nI'm not transgender and I care deeply about these issues and I'm not alone. \nThere are at least 700K transgender people in the US. Someone's family \nmember, friend, or coworker may be transgender and knowing the issues and \nterminology surrounding gender vs sex are enlightening and improve \nrelations. Others may simply be intellectually curious and would want to \nknow about this for the pure intellectual exercise of doing so and treating \nothers respectfully. \n\nSecondly, one can absolutely statistically prove that the progression of \nLGBT legal rights in the US scales directly with more people knowing other \nLGBT people on some personal level. That is a question and relationship \nGallup has asked and tracked carefully if you wish to look it up. There are \na number of important legal protections that  transgender people face \nuniquely because of their situation. Changing their gender on their \ndriver's license, birth certificate, passport, being able to use the \nbathroom of your transitioned to gender, etc. There are also a great number \nof people afraid to transition because of the discrimination and oppression \nthey would face. This is similar situation to gays and lesbians. In decades \npast they were afraid to come out and lived lives of quiet desperation and \nnow, in many places, gays and lesbians are able to thrive personally and \nprofessionally in a way I would have never thought possible. This is a win \nwin for everyone. So it will be for transgender people once enough legal \nand social acceptance is in place.\n\nThis is why it is important. If after reading that, you still don't care, \nthat's certainly perfectly fine. No one is asking you to care. We'll manage \njust fine.

Her surgically created vagina did not make her a women. 18 years \nof self discovery and self acceptance ultimately took her to a pivotal \npoint where she was able to finalise her transition. CNN focused on the \ndestination and chose to ignore the journey which is what I understand \nJanet's issue to be.\n\nThe way the producers dealt with the original segment was without a doubt \ninsensitive to the trans community and lacked a degree of understanding and \ncaution for the stigma which is attached to the problematic 'was once a man \n- shock horror! - is now a passable woman' discourse which is so often \nemployed to translate a generic trans experience through mainstream media. \nShe was simply asking to be treated as an individual and for her experience \nas a transgendered woman to be handled with sensitivity and more \nimportantly respect - and Piers did not do this. He placed too much \nemphasis on the instance of her 'coming out' to her cis partner and seemed \nalmost surprised to discover that upon learning of her past he did not \nreject her, thereby devaluing her trans body and the trans bodies of those \nin her community.\n\nIt was a very complicated and nuanced topic that was explored with rather \nminimal attention and tact by CNN. Trans people need a platform to tell \ntheir OWN stories not opportunities to be tokenised by middle aged, white, \nprivileged men. Piers' accusation that in some way Janet was trying to aim \nthe wrath of her community at him via Twitter is also ridiculous. I'm sure \nit never occurred to him that the trans community were not simply blindly \nsupporting Janet Mock in 'attacking' him but instead that perhaps he had in \nfact offended many in the community by his treatment of Janet's experience \nin this interview and that they personally felt compelled to express this? \nThen for Pierce to go on to berate her in this follow up... He had no \nintention of learning or trying to understand the situation from her \nperspective. Which only goes to show his inability to have dealt with such \na topic in the first place. His ego was bruised and he was trying to shame \nand belittle her.\n\nI can understand why she expressed that she felt unsafe in this space in \nthe original interview. Piers has a reputation for being ignorant and \nhostile and being both trans and a woman of colour there are so many \ncultural factors that made it so difficult for her to express her anger \nwith him in the original interview. She had to play the 'nice palatable \ntrans woman' because that is what the community expects from their \nadvocates. If she was to be confrontational she would have been working \nagainst her cause so I admired her ability to sit through that interview \nand grit her teeth and bear it. The 'angry black woman' discourse also \ncomes to mind here. People just have no idea how hard it is to convey \nyourself in a way which reflects the intentions of an entire community in \nsuch a small window of time and in this instance she was faced with the \nchallenge of representing both the black community and the trans community \nwith integrity. \n\nMy only criticism of Janet in this whole situation was her use of profanity \non Twitter. She could have dealt with her anger in a better way but I \nunderstand that in the heat of the moment people may lose some clarity on \nthe situation at hand.\n\nInstead of persecuting Janet for trying to encourage a higher level of \nsensitivity for the individual experiences of her community maybe we should \nbe applauding her for being brave enough in the first place to even stand \nup and have a voice when so many want her, and those like her, to shut up. \nIt can't be easy having the weight of an entire community on your shoulders \nand although this was a bit of a messy, mucky situation I think ultimately, \nshe handled it the best that she could.  \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ptrniavrnfz13s23rip2i4ziqhzngk04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 5, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu-Ph0lSaKBGEGVEG0L_7WA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4euWCFkFNlM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADFo/vFUgNJOmyUI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.80000000000000004, "authorDisplayName": "Patricia Thomas", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T05:04:20.460Z", "videoId": "0F8WiuxYoE4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCu-Ph0lSaKBGEGVEG0L_7WA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.7194640000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T05:04:20.460Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105897397670614765050", "textDisplay": "What a beautiful woman.

In fact, when many people refer to gender they do so \nbecause they believe it is more polite! I also have to point out that in \nthe UK there is less of a distinction between the two words. \n\nThe biggest issue I have with this is that this woman has made her living \nfrom telling her story, so it is totally unfair to then get angry when she \nis asked about it! She details her journey from male to female, both \nphysically and emotionally, so of course the questions are going to be \nabout that!

That is, \ngender over biological sex. Yes, quite obviously, she should have said \nsomething about it right then and there.

He quite frankly, did not \ncare that Janet did not feel comfortable enough to initially raise the \nissue.

What is wrong with this woman???  I'm not a fan of Piers, but Janet \nMock has some serious issues.  She is so embarrassed and ashamed that she \nwas born as a male, that she refuses to acknowledge that this is a major \npart of her story -- her \"fame\" is simply BECAUSE SHE IS TRANSGENDERED.  I \nhave read some of her writing; not only is she not an exceptionally gifted \nwriter on merit alone, she has notoriety as a writer because of the topic \nshe writes about; topics she writes about is on being transgendered or the \ntransgendered community.  She is an activist FOR THE TRANSGENDERED \nCOMMUNITY.   By definition. being transgendered means you were physically \nborn with the opposite gender (body) that you feel to be.  I feel like her \nreaction to this makes her a poor representation for the trans community. \n What if someone was born genetically fat, but their entire life they felt \nlike they were a skinny person trapped in a fat person's body; your outward \nappearance, and the way in which you look, dress, the way in which society \nviews you, treats you -- everything that gender would affect.  And this \nperson made their entire writing career talking about the fact that they \nare now who they always \"felt\" they should be -- a skinny person -- but was \ninhabited by due to genetics, and had to have surgeries in order to become \nwhat they always felt they were.  Their entire fame was based on the fact \nthat they are now the person they always \"felt\" they were, their activism \nwas all focused on this transformation and the dedication and strength it \ntook.  But this person refuses to acknowledge they were formerly fat, \nsimply because NOW they are skinny. If they don't openly and freely \nacknowledge the physicality of what they were born as, then their \ntransformation into who they are now doesn't exist.  Transformation cannot \noccur without an acknowledgement of what used to be, and what is now.  She \nclearly transformed into the person she always was inside, but that nature \ndidn't provide her with at birth; the fact that she is denying this makes \nit seem as though she is ashamed for having been born a male/boy. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": ""}}}
