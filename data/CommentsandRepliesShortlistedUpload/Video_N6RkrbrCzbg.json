By asking me the question, \"A \nmore important question would be to discuss wether omnivorous \ncharacteristics are ancestral traits, unique derived traits and/or shared \nderived traits?,\"  you are simply repeating my question to you.  But, you \nseem to think it's a different question. \n\n2)  You didn't recognize that I was asking you a trick question.  \n\"Omnivorous characters\" or \"omnivorous traits\" are largely meaningless \nterms, since omnivory isn't a trait or specific suite of traits unto \nitself.  That is, it's not a synapomorphy, a plesiomorphy, or an \nautapomorphy.  It's just an informal description for any animal that isn't \na specialized herbivore or carnivore. It applies to most animals.\n\nIf you tried to use omnivory as a phylogenetic tool in an actual evo-bio \nsetting, you'd at best get a lot of raised eyebrows.  It's not a recognized \ndiagnostic character or suite of characters.  And it certainly isn't used \nin primate cladistics.\n\nThe fact that you didn't instantly recognize this as a trick question \ndebunks your claim that you've studied evolutionary biology at the uni \nlevel.  This stuff is covered in freshman- and sophmore-level evo-bio \nclasses. So, there's no need to \"debunk your conjectures,\" as I can easily \ndebunk your claim that you've studied this material at the uni-level.\n\nNow, for your edification, here are the \"tells\" from your original post, \nthat revealed you have no uni-level background in evo-bio.\n\n-- Your point number 2 contains two of them: \"Guess what? Over 70% of the \nfoods we eat today did not exist before the industrial revolution. From an \nevolutionary perspective, there is simply no way for our bodies to know \nwhat to do with these \u201cfoods\u201d (which, as we all know, aren\u2019t real food at \nall)\"\n\n--- Urm, nope.  We have manipulated these foods to be MORE adapted to our \nbodies.  That's the actual problem.  As animals, we crave fat, salt, and \nsugar, for  perfectly understandable evolutionary reasons.  We have thus \ncultivated a number of food organisms to contain more fat, salt, and/or \nsugar than their ancestors did.  And we did it so well, that these foods \nare making us fatter because they interact with and fool our energy storage \nmetabolism so well.\n\n-- \"If you're from Europe, is it preferable in your genetic makeup to eat \nbananas that grow in the rainforest????\"\n\n-- This one displays your lack of understanding about the concept of \nancestral (plesiomorphic) traits vs. derived (autapomorphic or \nsymapomorphic) traits.  Europeans are not a separate species of H. \nsapiens.  Whatever their regional genetic variations are, they still retain \nall the ancestral traits as other humans.  Thus, yes, Europeans would do \njust fine on fruits from the rainforest, as would all other humans.  We are \nall the same species.  We retain the underlying digestive physiology and \nanatomy of hominoids  going back 22 million years.  Nature didn't \ncompletely redesign our digestive systems from the ground up when H. \nsapiens emerged.  It just made a few tweaks here and there, and kept \neverything else more or less the same.  That's how ancestral traits work; \nthere's usually no need to modify them, so they don't change very much over \nevolutionary times.  This is why, for instance, H. sapiens cannot produce \nvitamin C endogenously and must get it from food.  That's a plesiomorphy we \ninherited from distant hominoid ancestors in the Miocene, who were \nprimarily fruit-eaters.\n\n-- Then there's your point number 4: \"It was only when we started eating \nanimal foods/fish that our brains doubled in size, this is a proven \nscientific fact, allowing for the modern human and all our advances.\"\n\n-- You are referring here to an idea called the expensive tissue \nhypothesis, first formulated by Aiello & Wheeler in 1995.  While there are \nsome problems with the idea, I won't go into them here, because it isn't \nnecessary.  You got the hypothesis backwards.\n\nThe ETH does NOT say that meat-eating doubled human brain size.  it says \nthat an increase in brain size necessitated a dietary shift to more \ncalorie-dense foods, in order to compensate for the caloric demands of said \nbigger brains.  In other words, bigger brains led to more meat-eating, not \nthe other way around. The evolution of bigger brains came FIRST, followed \nby the increase in meat-eating.\n\nAnd further, while Aiello & Wheeler postulated that meat was the most \nlikely candidate food, they were clear that ANY calorie-dense food source \nwould have sufficed.  They specifically cited fruits, tubers, and oil-rich \nnuts and seeds as other potential candidates.\n\n-- Your point number 6 again displays an  ignorance of the concept of \nancestral vs. derived traits.  The human digestive system, in both its \nanatomy and physiology, retains the template laid down among the hominoids \n22 million  years ago.  It is a modified omni-frugivore digestive system, \nnot something totally new.  Calling us \"omnivores\" is redundant, since all \nprimates are to some degree or another; it doesn't distinguish us from \nother primates all that much, and certainly not from our closest relatives \namong the apes.\n\n-- Finally, your entire post displays a fundamental misunderstanding of \nevolution itself.  Human biology has not remained static since the Stone \nAge.  There is no reason, evolutionarily speaking, why it would.  The idea \nthat evolution stopped working on us 10,000 years ago is nonsensical, and \nit's a notion that's only really found among pseudo-science hucksters like \nthe paleo and low-carb diet gurus, and not among any actual evolutionary \nanthropologists or biologists.\n\nSo, it's pretty clear to me that you have not studied evo-bio at the \nuniversity level.  It's best that you just admit you lied about this, \nrather than trying to continue with your Google- and Wikipedia-based shell \ngames.  Most  of what you wrote looks like it could have been copy-pasted \nfrom some paleo-diet website or forum, and for all I know it was.  It \nwouldn't be the first time someone tried that stunt one of these comment \nthreads."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-DVTcpJg1RO-rZJBu-wyEw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bobby Frankenstein Mason", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13wx3zggzirxfury04chnwwloubwfwhupg0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-30T14:29:51.364Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-DVTcpJg1RO-rZJBu-wyEw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.62233399999999994, "formal_score": 80, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-30T14:29:51.364Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dEdmMHFkW4Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQU/gKTdTXEVYeM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104030215326390655947", "textDisplay": "+Graham Frost I can demonstrate your lack of uni-level study by asking a \nsingle question.

Why? Vegans, amongst other reasons, don't \neat animal products to avoid the death of animals. But agriculture destroys \nmore animals and the environment more than any other method. Growing \ntropical fruits destroys rain forests, shipped from across the planet. Is \nthis really sustainable? A single cow can feed a family for a year if \nfrozen correctly. Vegan ruins the environment more than ANY OTHER DIET! \n\n2) Guess what? Over 70% of the foods we eat today did not exist before the \nindustrial revolution. From an evolutionary perspective, there is simply no \nway for our bodies to know what to do with these \u201cfoods\u201d (which, as we all \nknow, aren\u2019t real food at all) If you're from Europe, is it preferable in \nyour genetic makeup to eat bananas that grow in the rainforest???? \n\n3) Broken down by nutrient ratios, what we feed cattle (that isn't grass \nfed/pasteurised) to \u201cfatten them up\u201d is almost identical to the \ngovernment-sanctioned food pyramid for a \u201chealthy\u201d diet! Is it any wonder \nwe are in the middle of an obesity epidemic?? \n\n4) It was only when we started eating animal foods/fish that our brains \ndoubled in size, this is a proven scientific fact, allowing for the modern \nhuman and all our advances. Interesting irony that the very capacity for \nmaking an argument for a plant-based diet comes from our ancestors\u2019 move \naway from a plant-based diet! Ah, evolution wins EVERY time!!!!!!!!!\n\n5) A recent Australian study was done with a group of aborigine who had \ngrown up in a traditional hunter gatherer environments, and then moved into \nurban environments where they adopted modern diets. Alas, lifestyles and \n(unsurprisingly) health concerns such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and \nheart disease arose. They returned to the outback & their hunter gatherer \nways for a seven week period. They lost 25 pounds each and all their health \nmarkers (insulin resistance, blood pressure, cholesterol levels ect) \nnormalised. Red meat, poultry, vegetables and seasonal fruits where \nplentiful for these men, I wonder what this study proves???\n\n6) Another interesting point, are humans digestive tracts designed to eat \nmeat?? Vegans say no, other people with working brains say YES - it turns \nout that much differs among animals, the markers lay in the composition of \nthe digestive tract! Animals have evolved digestive tracts and livers to \ntransform diverse food inputs into the uniform set of nutrients that they \nneed for optimal health. Herbivores have foregut organs such as rumens or \nhindgut chambers for fermenting carbohydrates, turning them into fats and \nvolatile acids that can be used to manufacture fats. Carnivores have livers \ncapable of turning protein into glucose and fat.The truth is that humans \nare omnivores, despite what some vegan proponents would have you believe. \nWe function best eating BOTH animals and plant together!!!! (Great study - \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10702160) \n\n7) Guess what? Meat/fish is VERY nutritious!! Did you know, that high \nquality, unprocessed meat is among the most nutritious foods in the world?! \nA 100 gram portion (3.5 ounces) of raw ground beef contains large amounts \nof Vitamin B12, B3 (Niacin), B6, Iron, Zinc, Selenium and plenty of other \nvitamins and minerals (\nhttp://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beef-products/6193/2) Vitamin B12 is \nparticularly important because it can not be obtained in ANY amount from \nplants (arguably some sea veggies contain small traces) Studies show that \nmost vegans who don\u2019t supplement with B12, 92% are deficient in this \ncritical nutrient (http://www.nutritionj.com/content/9/1/10)\nUnprocessed meat is also loaded with healthy fats, but meat from grass-fed \nanimals contains up to 5 times as much Omega-3 as meat from grain-fed \nanimals!!!! (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641180) But the nutrient \ncomposition of meat goes WAY beyond all the macro- and micronutrients that \nwe are all familiar with! - CREATINE forms an energy reserve in the muscles \nand brain and is found only in animal foods. Vegetarians are deficient in \ncreatine, leading to reduced physical and mental performance (\nhttp://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8207518) \nCARNOSINE functions as a powerful anti-oxidant and provides protection \nagainst many degenerative processes. Carnosine is only found in animal \nfoods (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15872311) DHA and EPA are the \nactive forms of Omega-3 in the human body and found primarily in animal \nfoods. The body is inefficient at converting ALA (the plant form of \nOmega-3) to the active forms (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11083485)\n\n8) Humans have been eating fish for millions of years, some cultures \nSURVIVE solely on fish and have zero disease. Studies show that regular \nconsumption of fish fights\n\nAlzheimer's \nPolyunsaturated fatty acids found in many fish may prevent damage to brain \ncells. Eating fish can also dramatically reduce the risk of high blood \npressure, which is linked with dementia. A French study of 2000 people \nshowed that those who ate seafood at least once a week had a significantly \nlower risk of dementia over a seven-year period than those who didn't.\n\nCancer\nA Swedish study of 6000 men over a 30-year period showed that those who \ndidn't eat any fish had between double and treble the risk of developing \nprostate cancer, compared to those who ate moderate or large amounts. \nShellfish, such as crab and lobster, also contains selenium, thought to \nhave cancer-fighting properties.\n\nDepression\nIt's been reported that fish can help to ease depression. Again, it's down \nto omega-3 fatty acids, which are believed to raise levels of the brain \nchemical serotonin.\n\nArthritis\nPopulation groups that eat a lot of fish - Inuits in Greenland, for example \n- have low rates of inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. Studies have \nalso shown fish oils to be useful in relieving the symptoms of rheumatoid \narthritis.\n\nSocial benefits\nAccording to research carried out in Mauritius, children given lots of fish \nfrom the age of three are less likely to have criminal records by the time \nthey reach 23.\n\nEVEN Skin\nAccording to dermatologist Nicholas Perricone, author of The Perricone \nPrescription, a salmon-packed diet can help smooth out age lines.\n\n9) TESTING - The Vegan diet is rather new in terms of modern human diets. \nWe haven't tested the vegan diet long term, I would bet all the money in \nthe world in 10 years we will not be eating vegan. We will know the dangers \n& this stupid method of eating will be obsolete.\n\n10) This idiot does not know anything about nutrition. Eating 50 bananas a \nday like some vegans do is VERY bad for you, thats a lot of \nfructose/potassium and your organs will suffer. They come from a eating \ndisorder background and obviously sits around all day obsessing over diet \nand body, that alone is not healthy. You may argue some vegans look in good \nshape, so would you if you worked out all day like most do?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-DVTcpJg1RO-rZJBu-wyEw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bobby Frankenstein Mason", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13wx3zggzirxfury04chnwwloubwfwhupg0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-13T21:34:04.940Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-DVTcpJg1RO-rZJBu-wyEw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.10209599999999996, "formal_score": 12, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-13T21:34:04.940Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dEdmMHFkW4Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQU/gKTdTXEVYeM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104030215326390655947", "textDisplay": "+John Morgan\nJohn, I'm a vegan, too.

First is the issue of morality of eating meat. \n Morality can not be a proper test because it is a subjective standard.  In \nthis video, you state that some of the animals who eat other animals do so \nbecause they have a nutritional need.  Be that as it may, the nutritional \nneed of the \"eater\" is the eater's problem and not the foods.  So if \nmorality is the test, no living tissue should be consumed because it is at \nsome level immoral.  (It is certainly immoral to the most important being, \ni.e., the living tissue).  \n\nThe second issue is one of natural selection.  There is evidence that \nthrough the process of natural selection, we have developed carnivorous \ntraits.  K-9 teeth, binocular vision, the ability to quickly and internally \ncalculate trajectories, etc. I believe, and of course have no evidence for \nthis, that vegetarianism may an evolutionary test.  That is to say, humans \nare now beginning to evolve to a point of testing to see if they will have \na biological advantage in becoming vegetarians.  If so (less meat, less \ncholesterol, less fat, less heart attacks, etc.), the carnivore human will \nslowly die down, and the herbivore human will become more dominant.  If \nnot, on the other hand,  (I can't imagine what the advantage would be, but \nprobably more potent sources of protein, I guess), the vegetarianism will \neventually die down.  \n\nVery interesting subject.  I do note that unlike your arguments against \nreligion or existence of God, which are evidence based, this is a moral \ndilemma.

This is why you cannot do anything to a \nrock that can be considered moral or immoral. The absolute foundation of \nmorality is the treatment of things that have the capacity to be treated, \nor mistreated, in accordance with their interests. This is an indisputable, \nobjective fact.\n\nNow that we have identified the foundation we can determine the objective \ntruth. You can say that morals are subjective, and this is certainly true; \nyou may feel it is immoral to stab a human in the foot but okay to stab the \nfoot of a cow. However, we can locate the foundation. Why are you against \nstabbing a human? What is the fundamental reason? \n\nThe answer is because that person would feel a lot of pain from being \nstabbed. They have an interest in avoiding painful experiences.\n\nYou could argue that it is simply illegal and the only thing stopping you \nfrom stabbing them is the threat of prison, but then you would still be \nacknowledging that the foundation of your morals are to avoid infringement \non someone's interests; that someone just happens to be you.\n\nAll sentient behaviour is rooted in interests. These interests are \ncapacities: capacities to feel pain and pleasure and any other feeling that \nfalls into the spectrum of consciousness. The concept of morality deals \nexclusively with treating everything in accordance with the capacities they \npossess. It's why morality is not applicable to the action of hitting a \nbaseball with a bat, but is applicable to hitting a dog or human. The \nbaseball has no interest in not being hit, the dog and human do. The \ninterest to avoid pain is the same whether it is in a human, or a dog, or a \ncow. As long as something has an interest, it has the capacity for \ntreatment or mistreatment. The concept of morality acknowledges this \ndistinction and from that we can determine what is moral and immoral.\n\nThat is the objective foundation and the logic behind it. Somewhere along \nthe road someone confused morals with morality, and concluded that since \nmorals are subjective the concept of morality must be also. This is \nincorrect.\n\n\"Be that as it may, the nutritional need of the \"eater\" is the eater's \nproblem and not the foods.  So if morality is the test, no living tissue \nshould be consumed because it is at some level immoral.\"\n\nOther animals cannot comprehend morality therefore cannot be held to the \nsame level of accountability as humans."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd5m9hcsZisPoVTlyLEm8Pw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ToTheConquered", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12bivozbkquftquh23sjpaimsb3tpf1i", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-25T06:57:40.086Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCd5m9hcsZisPoVTlyLEm8Pw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.35351400000000005, "formal_score": 85, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-25T07:00:21.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-U7CcrY87xuU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/ssdKwY09AGE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107382774942970649364", "textDisplay": "\"Very interesting subject.

Here, I'm not so sure.\"\n\nThis is perplexing for many atheists who have for so long fought against \npeople who have said \"You can't disprove God, so my point stands!\" And the \nobvious answer to that is \"You can't prove God, so your point doesn't \nstand!\" Since it's very rare that atheists are trying to force anything \nother than their own religious freedom on Christians, the atheists get the \nbenefit of the doubt. If the argument was something like \"There is no proof \nof God, so let's kill all Christians\" then it'd be silly for us to expect \nChristians to show us proof of Yahweh in order to save their skins and then \ngo slaughter millions of Christians based upon that argument.\n\nAnd this last argument is essentially what people who support needless \nanimal harm use against animal rights activists. They expect AR activists \nand nonhuman animals to prove that nonhuman animals are sentient beings \nworthy of inclusion in the moral community while simultaneously claiming \nthat humans are sentient beings worthy of inclusion in the moral community. \nAnd if proof of nonhumans' sentience isn't proven then the slaughter lines \nare expected to just keep on rolling. The fact of the matter is, the issue \nbetween Christians and atheists has never been about one side proving the \nother side wrong on the existence of God, but that one side can't just push \nthe other side around and abuse them until they provide the evidence one \nway or another. Yet, those who support harming animals see no problem with \nkilling hundreds of billions of animals over claims that have never been \nverified while AR activists are supposed to just sit there with a big \nsmiles on their faces.

This means that we can also grow \nmuzzle tissue. Muzzle tissue that can be grown, and shipped off to various \nmarkets for food. \n\nAnd since I am for transparency, and eco friendly methods of... I guess \ndoing everything, there should of course be a hefty regulations on how they \nwould create, ship, and so on.

It is impossible to \nascertain whether or not an animal's actions are intentional, subconscious, \nor purposeful.

I suspect that the only criteria they consider is, \"can I \neat that?\" Yes! The ability to \"eat\" is not the first and front property of \nthe criteria. A diet consisting of seeds, for example, would be sustained \nwith insects if seeds became unavailable, as the constitution and chemical \nmakeup of seeds and insects is incredibly similar.\n\nA deer would be considered a herbivore, but from time to time they will eat \nants. A koala will sometimes eat their parasites. Does that make these \nanimals omnivorous? No. The order an animal specialist would use is to \nconsider the whole of the species majority form of consumption. This \ncriteria is not a strict or pedantic order. It would not be helpful \nshorthand to use the premise of intent, or even action. If that was the \nsole premise, all animals at some time or another would have to be \nconsidered omnivorous. I feed my cat a vegetarian diet, and is therefore a \nherbivore by action. She is completely healthy and can clearly digest her \nfood, but she is still a carnivore, regardless of what she consumes.

There can \nbe no objective comparison, when examining rape and murder to animal \nconsumption. When a vegan makes such an assertion, they are not drawing \ncomparisons, they are referencing the arbitrary nature of morality, and \nmost meat-eaters fall into this trap. It is a demonstration to show that \nyou, as a biological organism will almost always consider your actions \nsound and will contact any number of rationales to prioritize your needs \nabove those that you qualify as inferior or lower in the hierarchy of the \nfood chain. For example if I consider humans as being equal to non-human \nanimals, the murder of a human is equal to a non-human. However, if you \naxiomatically label non-human animals as being less than, unequal, or \ninferior you will predictably not observe this as relativistic. If an \nadvanced race of alien beings landed on Earth, they would scan the \nevolutionary progress of the nearest homo-sapien and from a relativistic \nmindset they would probably consider us less than. They would undoubtedly \nconsider your death as being incomparable to one of their own kind.\n\nUnderstand that not every single human on Earth is completely sold to the \nnotion that humanity is intrinsically superior or that humanity is somehow \nmore valuable than non-humans."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCByJEGtH415yYbKBltMDUA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Shakovhudds", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13awfkotuvbvp0m122icr5wvleazjmpc04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-09T14:01:12.234Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCByJEGtH415yYbKBltMDUA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.11204400000000003, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-09T14:01:12.234Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115057938250075108520", "textDisplay": "If I was trying to put vegan point accross, I'd maybe try make people see \nthat a handful of nuts and raisins contain as much protein as chicken per \n100g.

Sadly, I truly respected \nyou and your views till you become the pope of the vegans.  I really hope \nyou can use the same logically thinking then we it comes to how human or \nany animal should eat.  I do hope when you made the choice to become a \nvegan you  did you research and noted that there is no vegetarians in the \nanimal kingdom?  that given the choice ALL animals will eat the flesh of \nanother animal.  I have been hunting since i was a young lad in the UK, \nwhen we would go deer hunting, the first thing we would find is another \ndeer eating it.  If you do the research you can not find a pure vegetarian, \neven cut bunnies will pray upon small birds if they can catch it.  Horses, \ncows, squirrels, you name it there is plenty of document studies of this.\n \nYour path of vegans is no less a self righteous as the quest to purity \nthrough the preaching by religious nuts, that we both agree are full of \nshit.  \n\nAs for the future of humans, as we explore into space and other planets \nmeat will become less and less important for our diets as it will no long \nbe economical to our energy supply. while that being said, it is not far \nfetched to for see a modified animal that will be used only for the purpose \nof feeding out race in far off places. \n\nFor the suffering of animals for the purpose of being feed for another \nanimal, isn't that the whole point of life?  The strong produce, and the \nweak either adopt to the new threat or die off?

And this is coming from someone who does eat \nmeat. In regards to how Honey is made. I prefer to remain ignorant \nregarding food because it's all pretty disgusting and I'd starve to death \nif I spent too much time thinking about where it comes from. Even plants \ngrow out from the dirt and shit. Fertilizer is nothing more than crap after \nall. Bugs could be living inside and you'd never notice them unless you \nwere actually looking for them. So regardless of weather you eat meat or \nplants you're eating something disgusting. Normally I hate being this \nirrational and ignorant but it's that or starvation. I won't eat anything \nif I know exactly where it came from. I always get boneless meat products \nbecause seeing the bones is a reminder that it was once a living thing and \nI can't eat it that way. Even though rationally it shouldn't make a \ndifference one way or the other it's how I've learned to cope with living \nin an irrational world. Most people complain where foods list ingredients \nthat they don't know what the hell it is. They'd rather have something \norganic than the chemicals some scientist created. I prefer the things I \ndon't know what they are because the organic stuff is all disgusting. I'm \nsure the chemicals would be disgusting too if we actually knew what they \nwere but I bet it's better than dead flesh and plants that feed on animal \nshit. I guess technically you could say that plants are also an animal \nbyproduct as they are fertilized by animal shit. Though vegans don't seem \nto acknowledge this fact. At least vegetarians realize this and will use \nanimal based products so long as it's not made from the flesh of the animal \nitself. Milk, eggs, cheese, honey, ect. can all be gathered without harming \nany animals. Everyone's opinions regarding food are somewhat irrational and \nstupid. Personally I think I'm the only one who actually admits it. If you \nwant to go without any animal products or byproducts you would have to \nstarve yourself. If you're only going to not eat animals then there \nshouldn't be anything wrong with dairy products unless you're lactose \nintolerant. And if your reasoning is that it grosses you out... then it's \nback to either starving to death or irrationally picking and choosing what \nyou can personally tolerate to keep yourself alive.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13pxt3zhlvaxzui404cibk5dve0fd0rtv40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2bPJsJCoNHUTbgx22omSw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EZCDrLgfTIc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/Xva1SzF4pJU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Knuckle Dragger", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-07T18:40:56.137Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCp2bPJsJCoNHUTbgx22omSw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.40522999999999998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-07T18:40:56.137Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111593166793185931176", "textDisplay": "Oh so you'll eat me if I don't have a memory spam of higher than 3 !\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13oszypkyukutins22ujnqrsynfc1wyi04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCETST7TxZ6mDTHgWTN2CouQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kJaNncbWV5s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADQ/Mely9GQExjM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Lisa winn", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-25T00:17:26.993Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCETST7TxZ6mDTHgWTN2CouQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0081160000000000121, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-11-25T00:17:26.993Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116857912115357835961", "textDisplay": "Vegans are great, but you have to make sure to soak em for 3 days in salt \nwater first to get rid of the gamy taste. make sure their properly bones \nand sliced very thin before cooking hehehe.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13scbn5ksmhzxntp232u1qpeuinz3ngt04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKdz4fanGgvxluPCq_sE4OA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wzR2zObuXM4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/uBwBGw-cTOU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Adrian Mol", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-05T20:12:31.726Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKdz4fanGgvxluPCq_sE4OA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.98719804, "formal_score": 98, "updatedAt": "2014-11-05T20:12:31.726Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116502955934789016834", "textDisplay": "info@gr4rent.com For more information about rental homes!!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ovn25kt3cz3tgx04chtf5ppapzlxoa1g": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkZyduzOIVxmkAQadtfPxg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mV9eIFWtMw0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACU/mRsqW4UBRrE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 3.5087719298245612, "authorDisplayName": "Kyero", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-08T00:25:21.352Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnkZyduzOIVxmkAQadtfPxg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.53861000000000003, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-07-08T00:25:21.352Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112133943075037077363", "textDisplay": "Did you know you're perfect because you're a Vegan?

Why? Vegans, amongst other reasons, don't \neat animal products to avoid the death of animals. But agriculture destroys \nmore animals and the environment more than any other method. Growing \ntropical fruits destroys rain forests, shipped from across the planet. Is \nthis really sustainable? A single cow can feed a family for a year if \nfrozen correctly. Vegan ruins the environment more than ANY OTHER DIET! \n\n2) Guess what? Over 70% of the foods we eat today did not exist before the \nindustrial revolution. From an evolutionary perspective, there is simply no \nway for our bodies to know what to do with these \u201cfoods\u201d (which, as we all \nknow, aren\u2019t real food at all) If you're from Europe, is it preferable in \nyour genetic makeup to eat bananas that grow in the rainforest???? \n\n3) Broken down by nutrient ratios, what we feed cattle (that isn't grass \nfed/pasteurised) to \u201cfatten them up\u201d is almost identical to the \ngovernment-sanctioned food pyramid for a \u201chealthy\u201d diet! Is it any wonder \nwe are in the middle of an obesity epidemic?? \n\n4) It was only when we started eating animal foods/fish that our brains \ndoubled in size, this is a proven scientific fact, allowing for the modern \nhuman and all our advances. Interesting irony that the very capacity for \nmaking an argument for a plant-based diet comes from our ancestors\u2019 move \naway from a plant-based diet! Ah, evolution wins EVERY time!!!!!!!!!\n\n5) A recent Australian study was done with a group of aborigine who had \ngrown up in a traditional hunter gatherer environments, and then moved into \nurban environments where they adopted modern diets. Alas, lifestyles and \n(unsurprisingly) health concerns such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and \nheart disease arose. They returned to the outback & their hunter gatherer \nways for a seven week period. They lost 25 pounds each and all their health \nmarkers (insulin resistance, blood pressure, cholesterol levels ect) \nnormalised. Red meat, poultry, vegetables and seasonal fruits where \nplentiful for these men, I wonder what this study proves???\n\n6) Another interesting point, are humans digestive tracts designed to eat \nmeat?? Vegans say no, other people with working brains say YES - it turns \nout that much differs among animals, the markers lay in the composition of \nthe digestive tract! Animals have evolved digestive tracts and livers to \ntransform diverse food inputs into the uniform set of nutrients that they \nneed for optimal health. Herbivores have foregut organs such as rumens or \nhindgut chambers for fermenting carbohydrates, turning them into fats and \nvolatile acids that can be used to manufacture fats. Carnivores have livers \ncapable of turning protein into glucose and fat.The truth is that humans \nare omnivores, despite what some vegan proponents would have you believe. \nWe function best eating BOTH animals and plant together!!!! (Great study - \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10702160) \n\n7) Guess what? Meat/fish is VERY nutritious!! Did you know, that high \nquality, unprocessed meat is among the most nutritious foods in the world?! \nA 100 gram portion (3.5 ounces) of raw ground beef contains large amounts \nof Vitamin B12, B3 (Niacin), B6, Iron, Zinc, Selenium and plenty of other \nvitamins and minerals (\nhttp://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beef-products/6193/2) Vitamin B12 is \nparticularly important because it can not be obtained in ANY amount from \nplants (arguably some sea veggies contain small traces) Studies show that \nmost vegans who don\u2019t supplement with B12, 92% are deficient in this \ncritical nutrient (http://www.nutritionj.com/content/9/1/10)\nUnprocessed meat is also loaded with healthy fats, but meat from grass-fed \nanimals contains up to 5 times as much Omega-3 as meat from grain-fed \nanimals!!!! (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641180) But the nutrient \ncomposition of meat goes WAY beyond all the macro- and micronutrients that \nwe are all familiar with! - CREATINE forms an energy reserve in the muscles \nand brain and is found only in animal foods. Vegetarians are deficient in \ncreatine, leading to reduced physical and mental performance (\nhttp://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8207518) \nCARNOSINE functions as a powerful anti-oxidant and provides protection \nagainst many degenerative processes. Carnosine is only found in animal \nfoods (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15872311) DHA and EPA are the \nactive forms of Omega-3 in the human body and found primarily in animal \nfoods. The body is inefficient at converting ALA (the plant form of \nOmega-3) to the active forms (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11083485)\n\n8) Humans have been eating fish for millions of years, some cultures \nSURVIVE solely on fish and have zero disease. Studies show that regular \nconsumption of fish fights\n\nAlzheimer's \nPolyunsaturated fatty acids found in many fish may prevent damage to brain \ncells. Eating fish can also dramatically reduce the risk of high blood \npressure, which is linked with dementia. A French study of 2000 people \nshowed that those who ate seafood at least once a week had a significantly \nlower risk of dementia over a seven-year period than those who didn't.\n\nCancer\nA Swedish study of 6000 men over a 30-year period showed that those who \ndidn't eat any fish had between double and treble the risk of developing \nprostate cancer, compared to those who ate moderate or large amounts. \nShellfish, such as crab and lobster, also contains selenium, thought to \nhave cancer-fighting properties.\n\nDepression\nIt's been reported that fish can help to ease depression. Again, it's down \nto omega-3 fatty acids, which are believed to raise levels of the brain \nchemical serotonin.\n\nArthritis\nPopulation groups that eat a lot of fish - Inuits in Greenland, for example \n- have low rates of inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. Studies have \nalso shown fish oils to be useful in relieving the symptoms of rheumatoid \narthritis.\n\nSocial benefits\nAccording to research carried out in Mauritius, children given lots of fish \nfrom the age of three are less likely to have criminal records by the time \nthey reach 23.\n\nEVEN Skin\nAccording to dermatologist Nicholas Perricone, author of The Perricone \nPrescription, a salmon-packed diet can help smooth out age lines.\n\n9) TESTING - The Vegan diet is rather new in terms of modern human diets. \nWe haven't tested the vegan diet long term, I would bet all the money in \nthe world in 10 years we will not be eating vegan. We will know the dangers \n& this stupid method of eating will be obsolete.\n\n10) This idiot does not know anything about nutrition. Eating 50 bananas a \nday like some vegans do is VERY bad for you, thats a lot of \nfructose/potassium and your organs will suffer. They come from a eating \ndisorder background and obviously sits around all day obsessing over diet \nand body, that alone is not healthy. You may argue some vegans look in good \nshape, so would you if you worked out all day like most do?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQNu9uWJ1e-8WLNo5hz5hvw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheVeganAtheist", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nuxshjlqhepucd22ihbcpcnf5ixwcm", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-29T18:13:28.832Z", "likeCount": 139, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQNu9uWJ1e-8WLNo5hz5hvw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.148256, "formal_score": 74, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-29T18:13:28.832Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JE4R0kLpXqk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA44/59x3Kq5dab8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110270561766491844717", "textDisplay": "+Graham Frost you are full of crap.

I have and the responses \nwill make you understand just how irrationally speciesist the general \npopulation is.\n\nEither way, the human population is going to require a paradigm shift, \nregardless of synthetic meat or not, if they're going to give up on \nneedlessly using nonhuman animals. With synthetic meats, the justification \nfor killing them becomes all that much weaker, but then again most of those \nsame people already go to the grocery store, notice affordable vegan meats, \nand still go for the \"real\" stuff anyway. Think of all the entertainment we \nhave in our lives today that we never had before, yet for some reason, \nhumans still line up to see bears being whipped while they ride bicycles, \nelephants stabbed so they do a headstand, bulls stabbed to death in a ring, \nand any number of other animals confined in cages so we can gawk at them. \nSynthetic meat won't change any of that, it'll just give animal rights \nactivists one more reason to show how humans don't need to hurt animals to \nlive happy, healthy lives."}}]}, "z13nuxmjjqffi3m0222mghdabqyex5qon04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yHGtWvmtVz5VGb9sAzMWw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ImpendingDeathProd", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-22T14:05:01.370Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1yHGtWvmtVz5VGb9sAzMWw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29285600000000001, "formal_score": 56, "updatedAt": "2014-09-22T14:05:01.370Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117930779757733115748", "textDisplay": "There are two statements in your response to the first comment, which I \nfind not to be wholly convincing. \nThe first one is the notion that there are no differences in the potential \nto suffer. This is something that is clearly tied to neurology, as pretty \nmuch anyone has to admit who concedes that there is a difference between \nsquashing a fly and a puppy. While the extent may be debatable, it is clear \nthat differences exist and should thus be reflected in our moral approach.\nThe second problem I have, is with the question of how to legislate \nsensible animal rights laws. The fact that this may be difficult in detail \nand that there will never be a 100% adherence rate to the laws does not in \nany way diminish the point of the comment. This is simply a point that \ncould be raised to attack any legislation, because many are problematic in \ndetail, none are perfect and there is never a 100% adherence rate. ( One \ncould for example say: But how do you enforce laws against murder in a \nspecies which is, to a good degree, motivated by aggression?)\n\nOver all, I believe your moral argument to rest heavily upon the idea that \nthe production of plants for human consumption does not  entail any animal \nsuffering or death. This is not true and a common byproduct of lopsided \nresearch. Plant production, especially in mono-cultures, has quite a high \nrate of animal casualties due to destruction of habitat, dietary needs of \nthe animals and the use of harvesting machines. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13pzrbqevjscxtlw22eezlzvpnbzlvog04": {"main_comment": "", "replied_comment": []}, "z130jduqlnbdudhoo04cjvvxqozoznyp44c": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNN6cvvYowB8tzdmHAz-3g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g8OJ0hzF52M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/yRO2AWJH6nY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.32362459546925565, "authorDisplayName": "Sax Panther", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-09T03:31:58.028Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMNN6cvvYowB8tzdmHAz-3g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.20682800000000001, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-07-09T03:31:58.028Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117735253135126870792", "textDisplay": "Okay...

Alternative can\u2019t solve- Anti-anthropocentrism is circular and can never \ntruly be achieved; it requires rejecting all values and preferences so much \nso that we cannot flourish\n[Cite]\nGrey 93(William is professor at the University of Queensland, Australian \nNational University, Temple University, and the University of New England, \n\u201cAnthropocentrism and Deep Ecology,\u201d Australiasian Journal of Philosophy, \nVol 71, No 4 (1993), pp. 463-475, \nhttp://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html) \n[Warrant]\nThe attempt to provide a genuinely non-anthropocentric set of values, or \npreferences seems to be a hopeless quest. Once we eschew all human values, \ninterests and preferences we are confronted with just too many \nalternatives, as we can see when we consider biological history over a \nbillion year time scale. The problem with the various non-anthropocentric \nbases for value which have been proposed is that they permit too many \ndifferent possibilities, not all of which are at all congenial to us. And \nthat matters. We should be concerned to promote a rich, diverse and vibrant \nbiosphere. Human flourishing may certainly be included as a legitimate part \nof such a flourishing.The preoccupations of deep ecology arise as a result \nof human activities which impoverish and degrade the quality of the \nplanet's living systems. But these judgements are possible only if we \nassume a set of values (that is, preference rankings), based on human \npreferences. We need to reject not anthropocentrism, but a particularly \nshort term and narrow conception of human interests and concerns. What's \nwrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of \nhumans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being \nconsists. We need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropo-centric notion \nof human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and \nself-regarding conception.  Our sort of world, with our sort of fellow \noccupants is an interesting and engaging place. There is every reason for \nus to try to keep it, and ourselves, going for a few more cosmic seconds \n[10] \n\nI would follow by arguing that to be alive is to be a biological machine. \nAs machines we cannot reprogram ourselves out of our anthropocentrism, that \nany attempt is automatically anthropocentric. In a world that this the case \nhow can we humans really be sure that we can do what is best for (other) \nanimals? How can we as humans (a part of the animal kingdom) decide for all \nanimals what their rights are...Our need to draw the line at sentience is \nalso very anthropocentric, why do we have an outlook on the world that \nimportance or moral worth comes from things that we humans deem important. \nI think that considering these things would give us better answers as to \nhow we should treat non-human animals? How should non-human animals treat \nnon-human animals? Would humans and just humans be the enforcers? Is it \npossible to have a say on animal matters without being anthropocentric? \n\nThe way that we should treat animals is in the way animals (and plants) \ntreat eachother. Generally animals of the same species take care of \neachother, but would prey on those outside. There are rare instances where \nsome animals can work in synergy. I think the best framework that doesn't \nfeed into anthropocentrism is to admit that we are humans, and to act as we \nhumans do: generally love \"cute\" animals, and kill for food as we need. \nThough like this we cannot stop all suffering and pain what we need to keep \nin mind is that veganism doesn't try to solve for pain and suffering it \ntries to solve for the pain and suffering that vegans/ dog lovers get when \nthey see animals in what looks like pain. The reason why we don't care \nabout plants is because of this... we perceive that plants don't suffer or \nhave fun, therefore, because we humans deem what to care about, we \nshouldn't care about plants. And then they justify it by saying plants \ndon't have brains (we care about brains), they don't have feelings (we care \nabout feelings),etc. This means the reason we come to care for cute animals \n(or for vegans animals in general) is because they have some similarities \nwith us so our sympathy goes to them. So how do we approach this dilemma, \nwhere our sympathy has become an extension of anthropocentrism, that which \nmade the plights of the vegans to begin with? Should we no longer criticize \nanthropocentrism because vegans have arrived to a logic where they can \ndisconnect themselves from people who eat animals and say animals are not \nas smart as me, and then the vegans saying, I can eat vegetables because \nthey lack brains? I say no. We should criticize anthropocentrism further \nand notice that there is no escape from the anthropocentrism. We are humans \nso we are going to look at the world through a human's lens. This means \nthat our quest for saving all living things is moot and has no impact in \nthe framework where we must accept as humans. Within the correct \nanthropocentric framework we must do what is best for humans long term. \nWhich does not mean saving animals, it can mean it (dogs can help people \nwith stress so we should keep them alive and happy), but generally no ( \ncows have essentially co-evolved with humans to be eaten). So we must think \nof the long term for humans, not think for non-human animals. This doesn't \nmean that vegans shouldn't be vegans because perhaps pretending to care for \nnon-human animals (instead of knowing that they just care because it pains \nthem in particular) could be useful for them could give them confidence or \nsomething...What I do want to make clear is that vegans shouldn't impose \ntheir ideas on animal rights (even though they are anthropocentric) on \nothers under the facade of being righteous (when in reality they're \nsympathy extends out of their anthropocentrism), and those who prefer this \nquest before saving/ helping their own species from institutional racism, \nblatant disregards to issues unique to each sex (including the new and rare \nsexes). Not to say that you Vegan Atheist does so...I don't see much of \nyour videos...but from the impression of this one you seem to have  a sense \nof being morally superior to meat eaters coming from your need to defend \nanimals because you have enough sympathy for them. If that is the case you \nare morally inferior because I feel like someone like TJ is more interested \nin helping people out than you. Most animals would agree on protecting \ntheir own, why does your framework not include an analysis on a human to \nhuman relation?\n\nIn the event that you have talked about this and I happened to missed it in \nyour channel, I have a few things to say. The first piece of evidence shows \nthat a prerequisite for veganism is solving the problems of our species, I \nimplore you to explore some literature base that argues that the way we \norient ourselves towards the non-human constitutes how we orient ourselves \nto eachother, and if you already have such argument please share it with \nme. Please PM or reply me. \n\nIf you wish to feature this comment in a  Stupid Meat Eater Video please PM \nme. I have no qualms in being criticized... I just wish you wouldn't call \nme stupid. I think it is unfair and that a lot of the people you have \npreviously called stupid had very valid though in some cases underdeveloped \narguments. But that is just me I know I cannot control you and you probably \nhave your own logic for this but I can't help asking. Also, this is \nprobably not the most fleshed criticism of veganism considering I made it \nup just now...but I hope you can appreciate my attempt at engaging you in \nthis topic.\n\nLooking forward to a discussion,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014Andr\u00e9s Monclut \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13bhndgfkj4xvntn23twhgwlkbssv1fh": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKOoOC59fD6TR6NsfW4bnEg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6F6rO_Ih6qQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABw/eRcXtHrobCQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MathCubes", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-21T04:12:44.517Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKOoOC59fD6TR6NsfW4bnEg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2014-03-21T04:12:44.517Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100061325216453637055", "textDisplay": "5th\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12pzvjr0tfzdrjtg23dz3ygrra3sjs4n04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSM-VdLHRokkr-8ip0ZgdZA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "George Young", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-20T22:35:37.218Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCSM-VdLHRokkr-8ip0ZgdZA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.12145800000000001, "formal_score": 25, "updatedAt": "2015-09-20T22:35:37.218Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117001976414783361681", "textDisplay": "I find the vegan lifestyle laughable.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13oezwpzzaed3vwt04cdj3q0oiaw5ugcqo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnYk04gjBwihpdFGMWn7Ysw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fBGsrJKgVPk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJA/pIelTddRqFY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.1764705882352942, "authorDisplayName": "Cybermat47", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-07T20:04:08.560Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnYk04gjBwihpdFGMWn7Ysw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.024909999999999988, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-12-07T20:04:08.560Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106087709605555408838", "textDisplay": "I like eating meat.

I believe it \nbecause I like it.\" It's why every argument of this type with Christians \nends in \"Well, you just have to have faith.\" If we had STARTED with that, \nwe could have saved us both a lot of time.\n\nI didn't bring up the \"What about plants?\" argument to hide the real issue. \nI was trying to determine if that was the ONLY issue beyond personal taste. \nI again point out that many vegans I meet use rational arguments to elude \nthe most important reason they don't eat meat.

Why? Vegans, amongst other reasons, don't \neat animal products to avoid the death of animals. But agriculture destroys \nmore animals and the environment more than any other method. Growing \ntropical fruits destroys rain forests, shipped from across the planet. Is \nthis really sustainable? A single cow can feed a family for a year if \nfrozen correctly. Vegan ruins the environment more than ANY OTHER DIET! \n\n2) Guess what? Over 70% of the foods we eat today did not exist before the \nindustrial revolution. From an evolutionary perspective, there is simply no \nway for our bodies to know what to do with these \u201cfoods\u201d (which, as we all \nknow, aren\u2019t real food at all) If you're from Europe, is it preferable in \nyour genetic makeup to eat bananas that grow in the rainforest???? \n\n3) Broken down by nutrient ratios, what we feed cattle (that isn't grass \nfed/pasteurised) to \u201cfatten them up\u201d is almost identical to the \ngovernment-sanctioned food pyramid for a \u201chealthy\u201d diet! Is it any wonder \nwe are in the middle of an obesity epidemic?? \n\n4) It was only when we started eating animal foods/fish that our brains \ndoubled in size, this is a proven scientific fact, allowing for the modern \nhuman and all our advances. Interesting irony that the very capacity for \nmaking an argument for a plant-based diet comes from our ancestors\u2019 move \naway from a plant-based diet! Ah, evolution wins EVERY time!!!!!!!!!\n\n5) A recent Australian study was done with a group of aborigine who had \ngrown up in a traditional hunter gatherer environments, and then moved into \nurban environments where they adopted modern diets. Alas, lifestyles and \n(unsurprisingly) health concerns such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and \nheart disease arose. They returned to the outback & their hunter gatherer \nways for a seven week period. They lost 25 pounds each and all their health \nmarkers (insulin resistance, blood pressure, cholesterol levels ect) \nnormalised. Red meat, poultry, vegetables and seasonal fruits where \nplentiful for these men, I wonder what this study proves???\n\n6) Another interesting point, are humans digestive tracts designed to eat \nmeat?? Vegans say no, other people with working brains say YES - it turns \nout that much differs among animals, the markers lay in the composition of \nthe digestive tract! Animals have evolved digestive tracts and livers to \ntransform diverse food inputs into the uniform set of nutrients that they \nneed for optimal health. Herbivores have foregut organs such as rumens or \nhindgut chambers for fermenting carbohydrates, turning them into fats and \nvolatile acids that can be used to manufacture fats. Carnivores have livers \ncapable of turning protein into glucose and fat.The truth is that humans \nare omnivores, despite what some vegan proponents would have you believe. \nWe function best eating BOTH animals and plant together!!!! (Great study - \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10702160) \n\n7) Guess what? Meat/fish is VERY nutritious!! Did you know, that high \nquality, unprocessed meat is among the most nutritious foods in the world?! \nA 100 gram portion (3.5 ounces) of raw ground beef contains large amounts \nof Vitamin B12, B3 (Niacin), B6, Iron, Zinc, Selenium and plenty of other \nvitamins and minerals (\nhttp://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beef-products/6193/2) Vitamin B12 is \nparticularly important because it can not be obtained in ANY amount from \nplants (arguably some sea veggies contain small traces) Studies show that \nmost vegans who don\u2019t supplement with B12, 92% are deficient in this \ncritical nutrient (http://www.nutritionj.com/content/9/1/10)\nUnprocessed meat is also loaded with healthy fats, but meat from grass-fed \nanimals contains up to 5 times as much Omega-3 as meat from grain-fed \nanimals!!!! (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641180) But the nutrient \ncomposition of meat goes WAY beyond all the macro- and micronutrients that \nwe are all familiar with! - CREATINE forms an energy reserve in the muscles \nand brain and is found only in animal foods. Vegetarians are deficient in \ncreatine, leading to reduced physical and mental performance (\nhttp://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8207518) \nCARNOSINE functions as a powerful anti-oxidant and provides protection \nagainst many degenerative processes. Carnosine is only found in animal \nfoods (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15872311) DHA and EPA are the \nactive forms of Omega-3 in the human body and found primarily in animal \nfoods. The body is inefficient at converting ALA (the plant form of \nOmega-3) to the active forms (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11083485)\n\n8) Humans have been eating fish for millions of years, some cultures \nSURVIVE solely on fish and have zero disease. Studies show that regular \nconsumption of fish fights\n\nAlzheimer's \nPolyunsaturated fatty acids found in many fish may prevent damage to brain \ncells. Eating fish can also dramatically reduce the risk of high blood \npressure, which is linked with dementia. A French study of 2000 people \nshowed that those who ate seafood at least once a week had a significantly \nlower risk of dementia over a seven-year period than those who didn't.\n\nCancer\nA Swedish study of 6000 men over a 30-year period showed that those who \ndidn't eat any fish had between double and treble the risk of developing \nprostate cancer, compared to those who ate moderate or large amounts. \nShellfish, such as crab and lobster, also contains selenium, thought to \nhave cancer-fighting properties.\n\nDepression\nIt's been reported that fish can help to ease depression. Again, it's down \nto omega-3 fatty acids, which are believed to raise levels of the brain \nchemical serotonin.\n\nArthritis\nPopulation groups that eat a lot of fish - Inuits in Greenland, for example \n- have low rates of inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. Studies have \nalso shown fish oils to be useful in relieving the symptoms of rheumatoid \narthritis.\n\nSocial benefits\nAccording to research carried out in Mauritius, children given lots of fish \nfrom the age of three are less likely to have criminal records by the time \nthey reach 23.\n\nEVEN Skin\nAccording to dermatologist Nicholas Perricone, author of The Perricone \nPrescription, a salmon-packed diet can help smooth out age lines.\n\n9) TESTING - The Vegan diet is rather new in terms of modern human diets. \nWe haven't tested the vegan diet long term, I would bet all the money in \nthe world in 10 years we will not be eating vegan. We will know the dangers \n& this stupid method of eating will be obsolete.\n\n10) This idiot does not know anything about nutrition.

And well..it \nbasically says ...honey is not vegan because it exploits bees....\n\nim sorry but thats not good enough.... aside from the pain and being \nsentient and all that stuff.. humans steal as a form of survival.....from \nnature...from others.... if we shouldn't \"steel\" from bees for their hard \nwork...then we should stop steeling from other \"hives\" of humans.....\n\nthats effectively saying its a crime to steel from nature..... then our \nentire civilization shuts down.....  sure im over dramatizing it but if we \nforce the prevention of steeling from bees. that opens up a slippery slope.\n\nIMO steeling honey from bees and steeling sap from Maple trees are \nequivalent... Both organisms work hard to make that product and yet 1 is \nsupposedly valued more than the other because of the issue of pain and \nsentience?\n\nIMO that is rather arbitrary and is equative to Racism, with in the context \nthat both the bees and the Maple trees produce a product we want but 1 is \nsupposedly a taboo based on ones Feelings of emotion based on genetic \nsimilarity?...\n\n(i say racism as denoting that the similaritys are in fact equal (steeling \na manufactured product) but one is supposed to ought to be treated \ndifferently as if they were 2 different races)\n\nAll im saying is, if you protest the theft of honey based on the principle \nof exploitation, then you also should protest the theft of ALL products of \nbiological organisms...including plants.......that would leave you dead....\n\n(and to get more absurd the theft of human milk from human mothers by their \nbabys because 1 is clearly exploiting another organism... and if you rattle \noff a list of what the mother and baby get from this transaction than you \nhave no choice but to accept the equivalent list from bees and humans, and \none does exist)\n\nand just for context, Define: exploitation\nthe action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from \ntheir work.\n\nthe bees get something from us in return for their honey, its an unspoken \ndeal but thats how evolution works. i would hardly call it an unfair \ntrade.... you try trading with a species not your own...humans by nature \ntry to make the most of it and give back as little as possible...because we \nplace value in things that other species don't and when it comes to their \nstuff VS their lives.... each organism has their own answer.... and when \npeople say we shouldn't steel from nature they are projecting their ideas \nof value to the side of the less well off...this IMO is why we have \nVeganism, they are not exactly wrong...they are just adding extra moral \nconstraints on their lives. unnecessarily IMO.\n\nAnd its because morality is subjective that you cant always reason someone \nout of meat eating if they dont think its morally wrong.... to the point \nthat it being unhealthy...its like any unhealthy option, alcohol... \ndrugs...whatever....its ones choice to take part... the value of life is \nnot equal to the context of the valuer ....there is no objective morality.\n\nVeganism is based on the emotion card....not something i excel at being \nsomeone who thinks in terms of scientism.\n\neven though i enjoy most of VA's vids it is...(dare i say) radical Veganism \nthat i disagree with.\n\n(i say radical because VA goes so far as to say people shouldn't use zoos \nand that even the lesser of 2 evils is not good enough, he wants no evil, \nadmirable... but not feasible, im not gonna say he shouldn't try... but he \nshould accept what he can get when its able to be taken, this paragraph is \nin part somewhat a continuation of the last time we had a conversation.)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQETNrnGyopz6XVu9oVrFQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ben Shabtai", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12yglmizpfbj5k1c23yhhlazviqy5wni", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-21T07:13:42.455Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkQETNrnGyopz6XVu9oVrFQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.51546800000000004, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-21T07:13:42.455Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BDBoLpB7aF4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC4/xSdtYqylBuk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106269080319000184656", "textDisplay": "He also said you should check out wether bees feel pain, are sentient, and \nso on, you know.\nI recommend googling the exact page he specifically said for people to go \nto: \"Why honey isn't Vegan\"."}}]}, "z13uzt4yeyyocdseb233gh2rdvasut4ew": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEUmiTvwsoVqPHSUpOSYPw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Bhr5WxCzTsM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHs/Ribn3FZugjc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "J Mc", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-03T23:39:09.108Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJEUmiTvwsoVqPHSUpOSYPw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.83684960000000008, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-12-03T23:39:09.108Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114436276409408671104", "textDisplay": "I eat meat because i like meat, thats the thing.

Should we just \nkeep taking care of all the farm animals until they die of natural causes \nwhile carelessly wasting billions of dollars ?\n\nWhat is \"moral\" or \"not moral\" is only a matter of  opinion based on the \nmost popular ideas of the time.\nWhat is moral is also based where you live , and what  time period you live \nin.\n\nSo are you o.k. killing BUGS that get in crops, and eat your PLANTS ? I'm \nsure you would have no problem KILLLING a cockroach infestation in your \nhouse. Also bacteria is living and I'm sure you have NO problem with \nbacteria experimentation where billions of bacteria are killed in labs. You \nsaid it best when you said \" If you make good money , and live in a first \nworld country than you can afford to be vegan \" . It's clear the act of \nbeing vegan is a smug \"first world problem\" !!!\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic - First World Problems\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12uwdub1um3udplr22cw5njim2zubahy04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwm9qAt1eIKTAZ6Rw-R_wQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zAd7-DkL8yw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB0/bMS9Pw61aBM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "RabbidOwl", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-27T06:39:11.929Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLwm9qAt1eIKTAZ6Rw-R_wQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.47873800000000005, "formal_score": 9, "updatedAt": "2015-11-27T06:39:11.929Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100844224144965940431", "textDisplay": "i thought being sentient was knowing you exist and know you can think, what \nis this called then?, like when i say sentient i mean the thought process \nhumans can have that like cats can't what is that? im curious.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwm9qAt1eIKTAZ6Rw-R_wQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "RabbidOwl", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12uwdub1um3udplr22cw5njim2zubahy04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-12-05T06:48:35.828Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLwm9qAt1eIKTAZ6Rw-R_wQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99999979083799995, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-12-05T06:48:35.828Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zAd7-DkL8yw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB0/bMS9Pw61aBM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100844224144965940431", "textDisplay": "thanks"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEew8oyf2Wh4i6qwk-L-wcQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Vegan Secularist", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12uwdub1um3udplr22cw5njim2zubahy04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-12-04T11:38:01.774Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEew8oyf2Wh4i6qwk-L-wcQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.33277599999999996, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-12-04T11:38:54.717Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107015888257498828507", "textDisplay": "+RabbidOwl What you are describing is self-awareness.

It is either consistent, or it is \nnot. My moral code is consistent. Yours is not.\n\n\"you can't present a reason why the values you deem relevant are indeed \nrelevant\"\n\nAgain you are using repetition as an attempt at giving a basis to a \nbaseless statement. If you yourself can recognize the internal value of \nyour own interests, and actively desire to conduct your existence around \nthose interests, and can recognize that other things possess those \ninterests also, then you can recognize that their interests are no more or \nless externally valuable than your own.\n\nThe emotional term for this is empathy. The logical term... is logic.\n\nSomething does not need to be tangible to be objective. Consciousness \nobjectively exists. Interests objectively exist. Infringement upon your \ninterests is objectively unpleasant regardless of placing value on it \nbeforehand, and if you want to effectively argue this I challenge you to \nget a knife, stab yourself in foot, and then try to use your powers of \narbitrariness and subjectivity to prevent it from being unpleasant.\n\nPain doesn't matter? There's no distinction between pain and pleasure that \nmatters? Again, stab yourself in the foot and prove it to all of us who are \nnothing but weak-willed slaves to our arbitrary pain receptors.\n\nNot once have I claimed that pain has any more value than the simple fact \nthat it feels painful. Having the capacity to feel pain yourself and the \ninterests to avoid it, you can understand the validity of those interests. \nAvoiding pain is a valid concern because our physiology and neurology are \nboth structured and geared together to process certain things as unpleasant \nand painful. There is a clear, objective value in sentience in that \nsentient things do not want to have painful experiences and prefer to have \npleasant ones. If there is no need to disrupt the interests of an innocent \nsentient being who was simply unfortunate enough to be burdened with them, \nthen the only logical thing to do is to not disrupt them. You conduct your \nlife by (I hope) mostly innocent behaviour, in the knowledge that innocence \nis a valid factor in determining whether your interests should be infringed \nupon. If you unnecessarily infringe upon a living being that did not choose \nto have the interests it has but must live with them anyway, then yes, you \nare illogical and unethical.\n\nNow, please address every single point I have made above. If you address \nany of them with the arbitrary remark, then I expect conclusive logical \nevidence to support it. If you fall back on circular statements again, I \nwill simply respond with a single-sentence comment and stop the discussion \nthere.\n\nMorality is a subjective construct but I have shown it can have an \nobjective basis in reality. Address this, with logical, conclusive \nevidence, or I will end the discussion.\n\n\"I value human life, well-being and progress. This is the basis of my moral \nsystem. There is nothing logical nor illogical about this\"\n\nTo be logical you must be consistent. Please list the absolute foundations \nas to why you value human life, wellbeing and progress. There is always a \nfoundation even if you aren't fully aware of it. List the foundations, and \nwe will illuminate your inconsistencies from there.\n\n\"the basis of a moral system is always subjective and has nothing to do \nwith logic.\"\n\nThat is completely untrue. I have explained aplenty that my basis is simply \ntreating things in accordance with their interests. This is subjective \nsince it is not exclusive to everyone, yet it is logical (interests \nobjectively exist and objectively don't want to be infringed upon) and it \nis consistent (I value all things in accordance with the interests and \ncapacities they possess).\n\nIt's just as possible that someone can form their subjective basis on their \nbelief that no interests, including their own, are worth pursuing. \nUnfortunately, this person would soon be dead from lack of food and water. \nThey would, however, be logical and consistent from the foundation of their \nperspective of reality.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are picking out of both baskets to suit your own \nconvenience. That is neither logical nor consistent. To determine whether \nyou are logical you must identify the foundation of your perspective and \nassess whether your actions and ethics are concordant.\n\n\"Don't expect people to value the same things as you do.\"\n\nI'm not. I'm simply pointing out the illogicality in identifying an \nobjective basis for your values and then only assigning value to some of \nthe things that possess that basis.\n\nI am expecting a logical, conclusive, substantial response with compliances \nto all of my requests. If you have the answers, this should not be a \nproblem for you. But I have made my rules very clear. This conversation has \nbeen spinning its wheels for a while now, and if you are unwilling to \nprogress it further, I will gladly cease to participate."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBwPbKPThyDfgv6BeuQUSTg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "David Fischer", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qvp4xlsmmgfutc23dt5bi5tnofxvun", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-24T02:49:01.255Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBwPbKPThyDfgv6BeuQUSTg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.66218599999999994, "formal_score": 93, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-24T02:49:01.255Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZpZB2SAHjwY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACs/O6dd5Hw8_7c/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109734222728993850482", "textDisplay": "+Bib Green\nYou are right in one thing.

The only valid \nargument (I'm not saying it's not important) in their favor is the moral \naspect of animal welfare. They should focus solely on that, because nobody \ncan possibly take the nutritionist argument seriously, not even \"dumb meat \neaters\". In short you can certainly say eating meat is immoral (it's hard \nto argue against that), but you can't say under no circumstances that \ncarnivorous diet is unhealthy. Or even preposterously suggest that humans \nhave evolved as vegetarians. It puts people off.\n\nMeat based or at least meat containing diet is much easier to fit the needs \nof the human body (a typical omnivore, like most animals including pigs and \nchicken). That is not to say it's impossible to have an entirely vegan \ndiet, but it's certainly not easy and requires a lot of knowledge about \nnutrients, essential amino acids etc. It would also require a variety of \ndifferent crops to be consumed daily to ensure enough protein and to \ninclude all essential amino acids. Not to mention that a lot of people have \nallergies to different plant proteins and most people don't digest all \nplant proteins easily (a clear relic of our evolution). It's impossible for \nall people to be vegetarians or vegan. This misleading and misrepresenting \nof what being a vegetarian (or vegan) is repulses even the people that take \nthe real moral problem of killing animals seriously. It's an insult.\n\nRuminants and equids as \"perfect\" vegetarians basically consume bacterias \nof their intestines at least as much as the plant material itself. That is \nwhy they are even able to be vegetarian or should I say \"prokaryoterian\". \nHumans can't do it directly (well we do but we can't do it exclusively), we \ndon't have the intestines for it. To solve the moral problem of killing \nanimals without pretending to be vegetarian, we could use biotechnology and \nharvest the bacterial biomass (not unlike \"vegetarian\" animals). It would \neven be scalable, since huge bioreactors are already widely used, not to \nmention cheap as well as a lot more environmentally friendly.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13vgzrpmujqdnnab04cc3fz0k3cyz3zn0g": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmxvcUJRK7b7T7P4xKBcNPw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-iIEZhYzjrz0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/VmgwFgYjTTM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Moraco Mole", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-12-02T14:36:03.403Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmxvcUJRK7b7T7P4xKBcNPw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.10130599999999995, "formal_score": 92, "updatedAt": "2015-12-02T14:36:03.403Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101505733961306357429", "textDisplay": "Plants, no capacity to feel?\nas an gardener I strong hardly disagree\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ogrohuv3ruveoj04ci1k4wzrnvfy5vek": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMAkNaKXmciN7oWJjMYuI4w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Misc.2", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-17T20:56:07.468Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMAkNaKXmciN7oWJjMYuI4w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.28293999999999997, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2015-05-17T20:56:07.468Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103317950425116864464", "textDisplay": "I recently heard that there was a study done that found plants are able to \nfeel pain.

First, a simple \nbiological note that with the existence of canine teeth in our bodies and \nthe fact that our digestive tracts directly represent that of an omnivore \nshows that we are tuned toward an equally meat/plant diet. Added to this \nfact is the evidence presented by concerns in space travel. Defecation in \nspace is... well... a sticky subject. In order to try and solve this, a \nminimum diet of meat was tried because it produced less waste as the body \neasily used up all the nutrients while plant matter takes longer to digest \nand this inefficiency obviously produces more waste product. Meat in a \nminimal - so, you know, not the usual US quantity - amount is an easy and \nefficient source of nutrients, proteins - milk especially has some \nimportant proteins - and calories.\n\nNow, I do agree with the issue of sentient beings needing to be taken out \nof the equation, but with the possible perfection of stem cell use, insect \nproteins, and 3D printing, there is a possible source of meat that could be \ncompletely killing free and industrialized to support a large user base. \nAdd education of appropriate diet including more plant life and I see no \nreason why meat eating and ethics couldn't coexist.\n\nThe real concern with this is that the hunting clans won't want to embrace \nthis, kind of like car fanatics who need to speed and rev their engines not \nwanting the quiet alternative of ecological vehicles. We can have our cake \nand eat it too if the macho pricks of the world could detract from their \nego. I wish I could be more political about that... but no.

However, the truth is that by purchasing and eating \nmeat you are just as, if not more responsible for the harm that is \ninflicted on animals. The industries and the people who work in them are \ndisgustingly unethical, and I certainly judge them as worse people than the \naverage consumer; but none of those industries would exist if consumers \nweren't paying them to keep doing what they do. The supply only exists \nbecause of the demand. It can be hard to see things for how they really are \nbecause society is good at manipulating and conditioning people, but you're \nalready more aware than most.\n\nAs for your meat cravings, this is often due to a poor transition into a \nmeat-free diet. Meat is dense in protein and often fat, so if you aren't \nproperly satiated you are wired to crave things that provide immediate \nenergy for survival. If you structure your diet a bit more carefully to \nmake up for the removal of meat your temptations will likely be suppressed \nsignificantly. There are also meat substitutes available which many \nvegetarians and vegans enjoy, so these would be an ideal way to transition \ninto the lifestyle.\n\nAnd of course, meat is an addiction. It can be hard to give up initially \nbecause it is often such a large part of your lifestyle and radical change \nis often daunting. You really need to make the veg*n mindset YOUR mindset, \nin that whenever you see meat you think about how it used to be part of an \ninnocent creature that was brought into this world to suffer. Then you need \nto ask yourself if your taste buds are more important than that.\n\nHumanely raised beef is simply an oxymoron, especially in retail \nsupermarkets and butchers. This is a billion dollar industry and there will \nalways be compromises to animal welfare made in the name of profit. There \nis nothing humane about raising an innocent sentient creature with the sole \nintent of killing it to make money.\n\nA vegan diet is usually no more expensive than a meat-based one, assuming \nyou shop smart and don't buy too much processed vegan foods (vegan ice \ncreams and chocolates are more expensive, but if anything this just \nencourages you to cut back on junk food). And veggies by themselves can be \nrather bland, but there are so many great recipes available online. I'm not \nsure how your parents are in the kitchen, but vegan recipes can often have \nless ingredients than their meat-based counterparts.\n\nLiving at home could be an issue, but you said you've tried to eliminate \nmeat in the past so I'm assuming they accommodated you during those times. \nIf you decide to give it another go, just be very clear on your reasons and \nperhaps request that they try to refrain from consuming meat so openly \naround you during your initial phases of trying to kick the habit. \nHopefully they will be understanding to this. \n\nI do hope you try again. I think you want to by posting about it here, but \njust needed a bit of advice to make the attempt less daunting than it may \nhave been last time. I hope I was helpful, and good luck."}}]}, "z13jtxrg4wb1glwhg04cfxeaml25fjz4xos0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP3E1B20R3VcOOg34q2ZblA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ZerqTM", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-18T23:30:14.255Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCP3E1B20R3VcOOg34q2ZblA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.96964760000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-12-18T23:30:14.255Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105989404982025260604", "textDisplay": "How about doing a stupid TheVeganAtheist comments video lol\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13rylk4rqjxub2kd23adlvyvtzthbkmw": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcApXb5kXFli80sXmJAECwQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lZZoKy-8gT4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEw/cKKpj8gnPGY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 3.7037037037037037, "authorDisplayName": "Peter Hechtsuppe", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-01T07:24:30.385Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCcApXb5kXFli80sXmJAECwQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.7703580000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-08-01T07:24:30.385Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114976236633349506275", "textDisplay": "I like meat and thats about it. dont have to explain to u fag ^^\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12hdh3gwnmzyzfbj04cgjjjzvbis5hozo40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5VtavMnQWHkml6x0suz2w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sZzHKoOudx8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADo/yX-XlwYBgdg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Lemon Creature", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-03T05:06:08.285Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc5VtavMnQWHkml6x0suz2w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.35904399999999997, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-05-03T05:06:08.285Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109000800668095159388", "textDisplay": "I want to be a vegan my self but.........

It doesn't matter what stage the animal is.... fetus, baby, or adult. \nAnimals , are not food, whether our society made it that way or not. and is \npart of evolution once we reach an understanding for the pain and injustice \nwe are causing. It is a chain reaction, and all of this will change \nsomeday. \n\n2. You cant compare a fetus with a Fruit. You simple can't. and if we are \ngoing that path.. a fetus, is at the same level as a Plant, or a growing \nTree... not the fruit, even trees drop their fruits , so all livings can \neat them.. and the tree remains alive. \n\nA tree, or a plant, is an alive being. and we must respect it.. just as we \nmust respect an animal being. such a human or a pig or a cow, doesn't \nmatter if is at fetus, baby or adult stage... there is no difference... A \nfruit, is part of a tree.. but does not contain the complexity of our own \norganisms... not even close to the same Tree/Plant which produced the fruit \nitself. \n\nAll this arguments are simply lack of knowledge and understanding. But we \nshould focus, again... on the fact that there is obvious pain caused. We \ncant ignore that.... and as I said. that's the first step. Compassion to \nthose who we know, can feel pain and suffering,. that's the first step... \n\nis it so hard to connect ? is it that hard to understand? If you kick or \nhit a pig.. he will hide, cry, and try to run away from you...just like \nyour son, daughter, mother, brother, sister or friend would do... only \ndifference is that they cant tell you, please don't hit me, don't kill \nme..... cant we make that connection? \n\nWe must be protectors, for those who have No voice. Is outstandingly \nsimple. If there is any possibility of peace, love and respect in our \nworld... starts with that. \n\nKeep in mind.. all of this changes, comes with sacrifices. Is not easy. \nSadly thats what we don't like to do nor hear.... Sacrifice our commodities \non behalf of others beings.

People are \nultimately rational and if we give them reliable information in a \nnon-threatening format they will incorporate it into their worldview.\n\nYes, there are some people that will avoid data no matter what - the people \nwhose minds are warped so far that their death is closer than a recovery \ndate. Yet, I insist this group is smaller than it appears. Often people \npresent data along with a subtle insult causing the other party to become \nhostile and not listen.

I \nhave read over these points and was interested in learning more.\nI will address these in the same order:\n\n1) While it is true the agriculture destroys land, often habitats of \nanimals, this is a necessary thing the human species must do to survive. I \ndo strongly believe we have a responsibility to reduce the destruction of \nthe world for out needs. It should be noted that most agriculture \ndevelopment in the world (around 65%) is used for animal productions. it \nshould also be noted that production of animals accounts for more CO2 \nproduction than transport WORLDWIDE. It also contributes a significant 37% \nof methane production, a gas that has more than 10 times the potency on \nclimate change than CO2. Livestock\u2019s share in nitrous oxide emissions is \n65%. Livestock are also responsible for almost two-thirds (64 percent) of \nanthropogenic ammonia emissions, which contribute significantly to acid \nrain and acidification of ecosystems. Truth is that it takes more land to \nproduce the same amount of protein for meat than compared to plant matter.\nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm\n\n2) I'm not sure if this is correct, but I'll assume it is anyhow. While if \nit is true that such foods did not exist, they make up the same basic \nelement of fruit. The body has a universal way of dealing with food, it \nbreaks it down into its constituent parts and ultimately sees no difference \nof how this food was originally formulated. So, say for example I have \nnever eaten a durian, my body breaks it down and sees amino acids, vitamins \nand minerals and many familiar molecules and can use these to fuel the body.\n\n3) While if this is true, not sure if it is. It is deeply concerning, but \nnones the less does not affect how vegans should see their diet.\n\n4) This is one of the most common misconceptions on the planet of our \nevolution. It was not meat as a foundation that *caused* us to evolve, but \nthe compact energy and nutrients it contained. Our brains were already \nevolving in our species due to our language capabilities and communication \namong our community. Meat was simply a tool to which we used to allow for \nthe extra energy we needed to allow further development that the vegetation \ncould not do. However, today we have a modern agriculture and worldwide \ncommunication structure that allows us to get the same nutrients without \nthis meat, unlike back then. You could also argue that if meat is \nresponsible for our advance brain capacity, why have the carnivores not \nevolved to such as stage? \n\n5) Again, this does not really affect any reason to not become vegan. We \nhave the capacity to get the same nutrients without animal products. Also, \nit should be noted that a vegan diet also has many of the lowering health \nbenefits as you mentioned. Studies have shown that while similar indigenous \npopulations live on mostly meat products and little veggies, an in depth \nstudy on their diets concluded \"The totality of reviewed evidence leads us \nto the conclusion that Eskimos have a prevalence of CAD similar to \nnon-Eskimo populations, and they have excessive mortality due to \ncerebrovascular strokes, and their overall mortality is twice as high as \nthat of non-Eskimo populations, and their life expectancy is approximately \n10 years shorter than the Danish population.\"\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X14002372\ufeff\n\nThis can be seen across a wide range of similar populations such as the \nEskimos.\n\n6) What's similar about humans and herbivores is as follows:\n- Broad, flattened and spade shaped\n- Short and blunt canines/none\n- Flattened molars with nodular cusps\n- Long and complex colons\n- Flattened nails\n- length of small intestine is about 10-11 times body\n- Saliva has digestive enzymes\nIt is also indicted that humans digest plant matter easier than meat and \nwill much less adverse effects. Also, while it may be convenient to eat \nmeat to get your nutrients, you can get the same nutrients on a vegan diet \nwith not as much effort as everyone says.\n\n7) While fish and meat both have great sources of nutrients, like omega 3s, \nthe highest source of omega 3 in in flax seed oil, 3rd highest (just below \nsalmon) is chia seeds. The highest foods in omega 6s are no. 1 Vegetable \noil, 3rd sunflower seeds. While it is convenient to have many vitamins in a \nsteak, these can be found in many vegan sources in large amounts and easily \nplaced into a convenient diet. Firstly, creatine is made within the body \nfrom its constituents which all come from plant matter. Secondly, your \nstudy states the following \"The major finding was that after \nsupplementation, the memory of vegetarians was better than that of \nmeat-eaters (Fig. 1). However, at baseline, *memory did not differ \ndepending on dietary style, so any hypothesised creatine deficiency in \nvegetarians did not influence memory, rather it was found that vegetarians \nwere more sensitive to supplementation with creatine.*\" Also they noted \nthat \"To date, the findings are too preliminary to allow the role of \ncreatine in the brain and the impact of its supplementation on cognition to \nbe established.\"\nNow, your carnosine argument states that it's a powerful antioxidant. This \nis true, but truer is that carosine is also made within our bodies from its \nconstituents, all readily available in the vegan diet. Now you DHA and EPA \nargument is also flawed because while the body is said to be 'inefficient' \nat making these amino acid chain from AHA, studies indicate that deficiency \nin these amino acids to not affect a person. \"There is no evidence of \nadverse effects on health or cognitive function with lower DHA intake in \nvegetarians.\" http://www.plefa.com/article/S0952-3278(09)00086-6/abstract\n\n8) 'Studies show' mmmm yes, like all the ones you're providing. Studies \nthat I show such as ones seen in 5) say different.\n\n9) Testing long term a vegan diet to my knowledge has not been done \nscientifically. However, find it anywhere, that vegan populations \npercentages have lower rates of many of the leading causes of death. I \nwould bet my money that people will one day wake up to the terrible cruelty \nthey're inflicting upon animals and change. Now that the bets are place, \nyou can easily find that a vegan diets is gaining momentum in many \ncountries. \n\n10) This is a subjective point and thus does not require rebuttal.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfdfCzxjw8zuOxPj-8LxJXA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MinuteVegan", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ozbfbgn3auffnn23kjzwgfufctxmof04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-19T07:32:17.940Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfdfCzxjw8zuOxPj-8LxJXA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.88401010000000002, "formal_score": 11, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-01-19T07:32:17.940Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HD_itzXN24M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEs/5L-2yZ2iF6U/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113607733543633100168", "textDisplay": "That's great that somebody know what they're talking about.

That \naside, i say, eat healthy, eat happy and do NOT let anyone dictate your \ndiet for you just because they THINK they know better."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIX4yAAcRvnOk6GEwnK1zLg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "andres iglesias moradiellos", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z124drqxkmauutetk22ujnqrsynfc1wyi04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-12-09T00:21:30.362Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCIX4yAAcRvnOk6GEwnK1zLg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.13492600000000005, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-12-09T00:21:30.362Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115111230224663325080", "textDisplay": "but what can be done about it? i'm a \"vegan\" because the poor variety of \nfood at my country (Venezuela) is a joke worlwide so after i walked 15 \ndifferent places of food with meat-chicken mixed and cheese i eat what ican \nget i make the effort to be a vegan because any non vegan diet requires so \nmany resources from the planet to obtain so few amounts of meat and milk \nthat is a mayor factor in the extincion of species and climate change \npeople now days think that the only way to be hot and healthy is eating \nlike five portions of meat every day and IS JUST NOT WORTH IT. thousands of \nfood sources for humans and yet the only thing i see is meat-chicken mix \nand cheese"}}]}, "z131trxolqncdxrc4220inkgqyytx5xts": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCibCF5Ns9_cqrVzaLMW8wag", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-g4rNQwlJD6o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIU/ZJ_OESxUr-E/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.408450704225352, "authorDisplayName": "whitemisa", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-23T06:56:42.687Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCibCF5Ns9_cqrVzaLMW8wag"}, "sentiment_score": 0.49798999999999999, "formal_score": 92, "updatedAt": "2014-03-23T06:56:42.687Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101013939307983169371", "textDisplay": "first I thought # 1 was the winner ....such a super extreme bad \ncomment...just WOW,...lol...but after I heard # 4...I will have to say \ndefinitely #4....wow what an sarcastic, narcissistic idiot and asshole!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12oyx0gywrbhlhkv22jzlkykkjksl3qg04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrsQhh8z9ZkP5Bl_8TGdJGQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IqAaAT_CGAs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADw/WnhvZ8cbwBg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.0695187165775402, "authorDisplayName": "sirawesome hat", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-21T04:17:49.052Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrsQhh8z9ZkP5Bl_8TGdJGQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.076765999999999945, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-04-21T04:17:49.052Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111756098251472982536", "textDisplay": "Okay vegans, if I don't eat a steak, it won't make it alive. \"but you guys \nkilled the animal to eat it in the first place\" no I didn't.

Because of these \nrelationships, I see that all meats eaten by living beings are of their own \nrelatives.

Bhagavan, \nfrom now on we stop meat eating, and will never allow my relatives to eat \nmeat. If any disciple of Tathagatas does not eat meat, we will guard and \nsupport him day and night. For anyone who eats meat, we will do great bad \nthings to them.\"\n\n   The Buddha said: \"Mahamati, the Raksas are ferocious ghosts who \nconstantly eat meat. Having heard my words, even they can arouse the \nmerciful heart and give up meat eating, so how could my disciples who \npractice virtuous Dharmas be allowed to eat meat? If anyone eats meat, we \nshould know that he is the big enemy of living beings and is destroying his \nholy seed.\"\n\nQuote from the Lankavatara Sutra (not from google)\n\nActually meat is not beneficial to your health.

for directly addressing the sentience question in \nthis video.  Unfortunately, I still feel as though your position on \nsentience is not well represented.\n\nI just read the full text of the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness. \n It gives no clear delineation between sentient and non-sentient animals, \nexcept for the portion that you quoted:\n\n\"Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other \ncreatures including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.\"\n\nThe phrase \"many other creatures\" is extraordinarily vague.  How are we \nsupposed to interpret it?  You apparently interpret it be far more \ninclusive than I would.  Earlier in this video you stated that most animals \nare considered sentient, then went on to specifically refer to fish as \nsentient.  I don't think you have presented adequate information to justify \nthis claim.\n\nI feel as though you're misrepresenting Darwin and evolution when you bring \nup differences in degree rather than kind.  While it applies in many cases, \nit clearly does not apply in others.  You would not say that reptiles \npossess mammary glands to a lesser degree than mammals, you would say that \nreptiles do not possess mammary glands.  You would not say that mollusks \npossess feathers to a lesser degree than birds, you would say that mollusks \ndo not possess feathers.  For certain characteristics, there must be a \npoint at which you can demonstrate that it either exists or does not.  I \nfeel as though sentience is one of those characteristics, and that many \nanimals operate on instinct and stimulus response alone.\n\nI'm not saying your position is wrong.  There are many valid arguments in \nfavor of being vegan, however the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness \nonly specifically addresses mammals, birds, and octopuses.  I think it is \ndishonest to apply it to all animals and use animal sentience as an \nargument in favor of strict veganism.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7C0bYOMLp77qZfJmE_24Uw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "dovregubben78", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cy5thrlaejr4an04cf51a0liagp3bie4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-23T10:32:22.782Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7C0bYOMLp77qZfJmE_24Uw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.49318799999999996, "formal_score": 17, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-23T10:32:22.782Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YNYf5vlcoVk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/woT5VQGOTT0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111836179561006722934", "textDisplay": "You're apparently not seeing my point, +Bib Green.

All animals in the farming industries, except for seafood, are mammals \nor birds.

In regards to fish, there are vast bodies of evidence that suggest fish \nare in fact more intelligent than some land animals and their cognitive \nability in terms of memory can even exceed primates. They practice very \nsophisticated social structures and advanced scouting techniques indicative \nof conscious thought.\n\nAs for their ability to feel pain, the consensus can be conflicting. Fish \npossess nociceptors that permit response to painful stimuli. Whether this \nis a reflex or a conscious experience is hard to verify. However, studies \nin Edinburgh on rainbow trout showed that after being subjected to injuries \nsome of the fish displayed symptoms identical to post traumatic stress \ndisorder in humans, such as refusing to eat and rocking back and forth as \nsurvivors of train accidents and earthquakes often do.\n\nFurthermore, fish that have been captured before tend to avoid the bodies \nof water where they were caught, and angler fishing has been shown to cause \ndecreases in catchability. Many fish tend to avoid places where they have \nbeen attacked by predators which indicates that they have interests in \navoiding being prey.\n\nIt's possible that some animals are not conscious, however the animal \nproduce industries deal exclusively with animals that have vast evidence \nfor their consciousness."}}]}, "z12relpbupnzxj43h22udrsqypextnrhq04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCAl3IYodj8TNhSFDZ8LY4g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "jordan young (thewaytothewoods)", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-04T23:44:26.311Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCAl3IYodj8TNhSFDZ8LY4g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99983599709999993, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-04T23:44:26.311Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101509998751627970526", "textDisplay": "Them miss spelt words :(\n\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13nhtfyrvydelf2k22gdbozxwn2wxv4304": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeMfixk3JOlb0FP3K-6uJPA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QYM0UfpyA2M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEY/eBExC78yT34/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Aborysa", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-13T20:20:18.799Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeMfixk3JOlb0FP3K-6uJPA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.14860199999999996, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-07-13T20:20:18.799Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109801843337515946392", "textDisplay": "Do you know why we can make \"moral\" choices while many predators can't.

As it seems, \nyour answer to many of these criticisms about how animals with less \nintelligence not deserving rights is simply to state that if an animal has \na vested interest in itself, then it deserves rights, assuming I have \nassumed your position correctly. I cannot simply agree with a standard this \nlow.\n\nLet us take the law that govern humans to illustrate a point: the law, \ngenerally, is made to protect the people from otherwise immoral action, \nsuch as protection of rights. The reason that a power might wish to enact a \nlaw based on morals, the thing that would discern right actions from wrong \nactions, would be, once again, for protection. Protection from what? From \nsomeone who has either not considered the moral ramifications of their \nactions when committing a crime, or someone who has decided that the self \nbenefit from committing the crime out weighs the moral wrong attached to it.\n\nSure, we can say that someone who does not judge the moral weight of their \nactions but who has also not committed any crime should still have rights, \njust as we might say a sociopath shouldn't be condemned for nothing. On the \nother hand, someone who does not have full mental faculties is usually \nconsidered to be either less than human, or someone who requires certain \namount of care. What's more, is that when a human doesn't have empathy, we \ncould consider curing that as an alternative.\n\nWhen you take an entire species not designed to have certain mental \nfaculties such as discerning right from wrong, there is no such alternative \nto stripping their rights that will not be fruitless. It's not to say that \nthey cannot be trusted to stop themselves from committing a heinous act, \nbut by giving them rights that would otherwise allow them to do such \nthings, we are endangering ourselves and doing very little to advance \nsociety as a whole.\n\ntl;dr : if animals can't into moral and we lock up people who can't into \nmoral, why do animals deserve rights?\n\nI have also noticed that this was from a year ago and I apologize if you \nhave heard this argument a thousand times over.\n\nOn a side note, it is very childish of you to use \"bee vomit\" to try and \nconvince someone not to eat honey.

If you believe that the consumption of honey is \nimmoral and damaging to the ecosystem then I must say that is an ignorant \ncomment. I already know how honey was made and no it does not disgust me \none bit (what that even has to do with the ethics of consuming honey I \ndon't know, seems like a big red herring that non sequitur to me). How \ncould caring for bees in order to consume left over honey and use their wax \npossibly be immoral? Insects have basically no mental capacity whatsoever  \nto experience emotion and unlike higher order animals are pretty much \nbiological machines. Even if they were arguably treated poorly (in the \nobjective sense that their treatment is not conducive to their \nprosperity) their lack of capacity to understand their maltreatment makes \nthe issue of moral treatment dicey at best.\n\nAs far as cow's milk: I assume your argument is that cows can be treated \npoorly on some farms and that is unethical. Well, sure, but it is a \ncomplete non sequitur argument to then say that the consumption of milk is \nimmoral unless it is the rule that cows are treated poorly and not the \nexception. And even if it were the rule that cows were treated poorly it \nwould only be immoral to facilitate their treatment by keeping the farmers \nin business through buying their products and would not make the \nconsumption itself immoral. The issue would be how the farmers treat the \ncows.\n\nTo the issue as a whole: since not everyone is capable of becoming a vegan \ndue to lack of resources (whether that be monetary or being unable to \nreplace the nutrients) it can not be said that it is immoral to consume \nanimals. Morality is subjective and therefore subject to the consensus of \nothers. Since the overwhelming majority of people find it perfectly \nacceptable to kill an animal for sustenance it can not be said that it is \nimmoral. You can say that you don't agree with it but you it wrong to call \ninto question the ethics of those who have a different opinion. No one in \ntheir right mind would argue that it is ok to treat animals poorly or that \nthey should not have rights. But on the same token I don't believe that \nanyone in their right mind could be so sententious to accuse others of \ndiffering beliefs to be immoral or unethical. If I keep chickens well and \ntreat them with respect, how could one possibly call into question my \nvirtues for eating their eggs (which are not alive by any objective or \nsubjective definition)?\n\nPerhaps I don't understand properly your beliefs because you have not been \nperspicuous enough, but from what I've heard it sounds like you believe any \nconsumption of animal products to be immoral, which following basic logic \nmeans that anyone who consumes animal products is immoral. That is just so \nridiculously fallacious that you should win your own award.\n\nAddendum: I also don't believe you fully understand the ramifications of \nfarming: all over the US wild boar populations desolate farms and require \ntheir mass execution in order for you to eat your vegetables. Is it then \nimmoral to eat those executed boar? Of course not, and so that is just \nanother point that refutes your argument that the simple consumption of \nflesh is immoral.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12xdrm4vpz2hzgnh222ejezzxvqzztde": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTvOSLBXkcm5ZcEcLX_ANUg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3vF0ICfeos8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADV8/SeSB8lx4Cjs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dan Hiebert", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-24T22:58:43.143Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTvOSLBXkcm5ZcEcLX_ANUg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.83926029999999996, "formal_score": 5, "updatedAt": "2014-03-24T22:58:43.143Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102272524374245742722", "textDisplay": "This is tough...\n\n#1 because he does try hard to be intellectual with his comment but fails \nto see his own contradictions.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12yhvwpominvnbgn04ccrfygv2wcdjircs": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe8zAwxgdcvEb8kG32ZI6Dg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Steve L", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-20T20:39:04.905Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCe8zAwxgdcvEb8kG32ZI6Dg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.18759400000000004, "formal_score": 35, "updatedAt": "2014-11-20T20:39:04.905Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100530452422224505900", "textDisplay": "Why can't I reply to Graham Frost's last comment (essay)?  There is so much \nwrong with it.  From a claim that he can disprove a vegan diet in one \nsentence to a 118-line comment - that's one long sentence!  I love how he \nmakes it seem like only vegans eat mass-farmed fruit and veg.  And how can \nan industry that, by its very nature, requires the killing of animals be \nless destructive than growing fruits and vegetables?  Plus, rain forests \nare destroyed for the benefit of many industries, which are in no way \nvegan-related.\n\nMost of his arguments do not contest a vegan diet, they merely highlight \nsome of the benefits of eating meat.  Sure, meat is a good source of B12 \nand other vital nutrients, but this does not mean that these can only be \nobtained from meat.  From my research, the only risk I can find worth be \nconcerned with is B12 deficiency.  However, the human body needs so little, \nand stores it for so long, that ensuring an adequate intake is easy with \neither supplements or B12-fortified foods.  A simple blood test from time \nto time will also help keep track of B12 levels.  Also, for the record, \nanimals get their B12 from the soil when they eat grass or other plants.\n\nI would just like to point out that any claim that a vegan diet is \ndetrimental to one's health is unjustified.  Anyone who does not obtain \nenough vital nutrients through their diet, or consumes too much unhealthy \nfood (highly sugary and fatty ones, for example) runs the risk of health \nproblems.  This goes for any type of diet, meat or no meat.\n\nI think it's fair to assume that most vegans choose such a diet mainly \nbecause they don't agree with the physical and mental suffering of other \nlife forms.

We don't fully understand plants but yeah I agree I don't think they \nwell have the sensation of pain that we experience, come to think about it \nother species might not feel pain like us (not denying that they can't \nsuffer) for instance fish/invertebrates might feel pain in a completely \ndifferent way! Who knows in the future we might find out that plants \nactually feel \"Pain\".

Maybe in \na million years from now we will become herbivores or carnivores but NOW we \nare omnivores. It is a fact that our ancestors hunted animals many \nthousands of years ago. Many tribes that to this day life secluded from \nmodern civilisation still hunt animals. It is in their and our nature to \neat meat. I agree that perhaps today we have the science and technology to \nget most if not all meat nutrients from other sources, but that doesn't \nchange the fact that we are omnivores. Talking about our teeth or nails or \nother individual body parts as a way of trying to prove that humans are \nherbivores is ridiculous. I respect vegetarians and vegans that are \nconcerned with preventing cruelly to animals and i too think that there are \nfarms and slaughter houses out there that out to be eradicated, but i laugh \nat people who stubbornly deny our nature as a species. There is nothing \nwrong with eating meat or using an animal product if it has been humanly \nand respectfully procured from an animal. It is the circle of life. Even \nfriggin Mufasa knew that. There is also nothing wrong with being vegan if \nyour cause is raising awareness about animal cruelty which is a noble \ncause, but vegans need to accept that they are not being the humans that \nmother nature intended us to be diet wise.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0CX99QvjCKclzE6l0QMRQQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.33726812816188873, "authorDisplayName": "Nova Borealis", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ncjybvtvrjbxl223gxfvwzzb2v5lm2", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-16T12:40:01.940Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0CX99QvjCKclzE6l0QMRQQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.32536199999999998, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-16T12:40:31.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VT1TW5b0SC8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABQg/U3IoV1z160s/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117289468953396845024", "textDisplay": "+PedanticCreeper | a.k.a BritishCritic actually we can't eat raw meat.\n\nthe reason is because a raw meat rots much faster than a cooked one, which \nresults in stomach poisoning, which gonna make you die.\n\n\nwith your logic that ''we can eat raw meat'' then i can back it up with \nsimple stuff like, even a cow can eat meat and still stay alive lmao.\n\nour intesticles are long not short like a carnivores or an omnivores \ninstesties, \ndon't come up with Bullshit like our stomach can expand x7 times of it's \nsize lmao.\nsame shit happens with every animals stomach, it's OWN ABILITY TO EXPAND \ndoesn't matter what you eat.\n\nLong intesticles = effective for carbs to be digested, Short intesticles = \neffective for meat to be digested, the whole point is meat has to leave the \nbody as soon as possible cuz toxins gather because it ROTS faster than a \nvegetable.\n\nnow for the last thing to shut your mouth completely, Our calves moron, yes \nit's for long distance but not running but *WALKING*\n\nwe are animals that switch places and travel long distances, ask yourself \nhow people went to asia then to amerika? they traveled by walking, a human \ncan walk longer distance than running that distance, if we were long \ndistance runners then we would look like marathon runners you dickface, \nwhich we don't for a REASON.\n\nour body is not meant to hunt, no sharp nails,teeth,no ability to catch \nanimals, we are just smart, and that is not cuz nature made us smart lmfao, \ntake a look at history and go research stuff before you even open your \nstinky mouth.\n\nyour excuses are debunked easily.\ndone!\n\n~Nova Borealis\n~Your Proffesional anti-close mind badass."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2838rpNogDJMZVsyHEQRSA", "inappropriate_score": 0.14903129657228018, "authorDisplayName": "PedanticCreeper", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ncjybvtvrjbxl223gxfvwzzb2v5lm2", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-15T20:19:49.481Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC2838rpNogDJMZVsyHEQRSA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.12160400000000005, "formal_score": 18, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-15T20:19:49.481Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pa-zaFWhO1s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALE/U_x_Ajuqwss/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101648205991908881674", "textDisplay": "+Nova Borealis\nActually, we can eat raw meat.

Many herbivores are slow or sneaky, as they don't need to \nrun for food. Those that do run are *fast*. *Extremely fast*. They are \nsupposed to be fast enough to outrun their predators. Yet the human body is \nnot fast. In a situation where you are chased by a cheetah, humans are \nsimply not fast enough to win. But in a situation where humans chase \nsomething fast, we win. We have the ability to keep going for a long time \ndue to heat regulation and many other systems inside the human body. The \nhuman stomach expanding to over 7x its size is another example. Animals \nthat hunt eat more rarely than herbivores, so an expanding stomach to \nprevent food waste is perfect. Why would a system perfect for hunting prey \nover long distances evolve in a herbivore species, along with many others \nperfect for a carnivorous species? It wouldn't. We are not herbivores. We \nare adapted specifically to be omnivores. Not carnivores, definitely not \ncarnivores.

And even if not apparent through behavior, if we know a species' \nbrain is not reasonably capable of this (or if it has no brain at all), we \ncan conclude that it is not conscious or at least not comparable to humans. \n\nMeaning I'd say Descartes and Einstein are both wrong via \novergeneralization. But it is very interesting debate on what consciousness \neven is. You might be interested in the Turing Test, which asserts that if \na computer output behaves like a human, it *is* conscious as well. Highly \ndebatable and interesting for the same reasons as animal rights.

Modern studies done with the Inuit in the \nnorth and the Aborigines in Australia have shown this to be true. Only when \nthese groups were introduced to the western diet did their health decline \nand cholesterol skyrocket. A study done in Australia followed a group of \nAborigines who had become westernized and asked them to live in the bush \nagain. After just merely 7 weeks back in the bush, on a diet consisting of \nabout 74%(my numbers may be a bit off but not much) meat their health \nimproved dramatically and cholesterol levels plummeted.

It's a controversial issue between animal rights activists. To \nme, I try to look at my relationship with other animals in the same way \nthat I do with human animals. Would I ever buy a human slave at a store so \nthat I could have a friend? Probably not. Would I ever stop my car to pick \nup a homeless human who was crying and starving, bring him to my house, \npick the ticks off of him, give him a free meal, then gradually keep that \nup if he seemed to really enjoy living with me? Sure. \n\nSanctuaries operate as a better-than-the-worst option. Ideally, none of \nthose animals would need a sanctuary, but unfortunately many do.

But other animals can still do quite \nwell on their own, and some animals have learned that a great way to \nsurvive in this world is to become friends with a human. While it may not \nalways be the best thing for us to look for nonhumans to bring into our \nhome, it may be much worse to turn our backs on nonhumans that genuinely \nneed and want help from another being, regardless of species.\n\nGauging all of this is tricky since many scenarios look the same from a \ndistance.

I saw one of your vegan presentations and a debate. I'm \ntrying to give yiur vegan points serious thought. But this meat-eater name \ncalling is Rediculous. You might as well call me an air breather. We've \nbeen eating meat long before we pretty much dominated the planet as a \nspecies and started handling animals this way.\nAnyway, aside from calling the animals machines and resources, I agree with \nthe first stupid meat eater comment so far. \nA. If we treat the animals well. (Happy life). And kill them clean. (Quick \nand painless). Then I'm all for it.\nWe aren't hunter gatherers any more but humans have been eating meat \nforever.\n\nAnyway, as far as health and resources go, the vegan arguement makes sense \nand the meat eating argument seems like more of an emotional attatchment to \nthe meat we've been eating forever. Such as...I just can't imagine a world \nwhere we don't eat meat. Seriously, you could make a sci-fi movie where \npeople think eating meat is a laughable thing of the past.\n\nSo, I've got like two things left to say. Calling \"meat eaters\" such a \nsilly name and calling us stupid or evil is very dumb. I frown upon this \nretardism. And, rather tha telling people they have to stop eating meat, I \nthink alternatives to meat should be made. I don't know of any meat \nalternatives but if there's stuff that's not meat but tastes like meat then \nwhy should people care. I don't particularly lay attention to how we get \nmeat from animals. So if I couldn't notice the difference in taste of some \nkind of fake meat. Then that's fine by me. To ahead and stop farming \nanimals if you can come up with a good alternative to eggs, cheese, milk, \nand of course, MEAT!\nI couldn't live without eggs man, I eat eggs daily and I have chocolate \nmilk often. I also like cake. Can you make that without eggs?\nWork with us! The world would have to change gradually. It's not gonna \nhappen just by saying, \"take meat off the menu! Everybody become vegan!\" \nAnd certainly not by calling meat eaters evil because I can stomache \nkilling of an animal. Though I would prefer they didn't do the de horning \nand hanging of cows by the feet and such. That's unesessisary. We already \ndominate the species and eat them.

Almost because, as an example: \n(as in 18:24)\n1.humans do not need to eat other animals to live healthy lives.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but it would be more accurate to say: \n\n[Today] humans [in a fairly developed community (or society)] do not need \nto eat other animals [, specially if they take B12 supplements,] to live \nhealthy lives.\n\nI know that in this video and others you address some of the points I'm \nregarding here. But the thing I find interesting with summaries is that \nusually they can be understood in a wrong way if they do not address some \nnecessary requirements. Some times I think it is better for a summary or \npoint to be a little more convoluted, but more precise, than to be simple \nand inaccurate. It is a dilemma, because we can't explain everything and \nevery word to communicate, but still with a little more like the above \nexample I think it will save you time with misunderstandings and \nmisrepresentation of your point of view.\n\nThe other reason I almost agree with the points above is also related to \nthis intentional inaccuracy when simplifying ideas. By simplifying this \nsentence it doesn't become apparent that the more you think about the \nsubject the more explanations you need to put in the sentence to become an \naccurate description of reality, and why this is a problem? The more \nconditions are needed to link HUMAN DIET and HEALTHY lives, the more it \nbecomes clear that this is not an easy business as many people make it to \nbe by simplifying it. It is not that easy to have a healthy diet for one.\n\nOther points I made as explanation in the phrase, and many more could be \nmade (some were even explained in this video like point 4 regarding the \nenvironment), are conditions that usually will favor the easiest or most \nrewarding outcome when considering a short period of time. So, for \ninstance, many poor communities have eating disorders because unhealthy \nproducts are more abundant, cheaper, addictive, and propagated through \ncommercials. One of the reasons it is easy to wrongly exploit this for \nprofit is because humans are not so much about reason when it comes to \neating, but more about reward and satisfaction just like the other animals.\nSo when you say HUMANS DONT NEED it looks like you are trying \ncompartmentalize humans as being very reasonable when it comes to diet, \nwhen they are not. With all those conditions as I mentioned, which are not \nso easy to comply, they don't need in theory (in did not find a better term \nto use here), but even then it would be possible for still feeling the \nnecessity.\n\nI think we could evolve in a better society by drastically diminishing the \nculture of what (and who) we eat. We could be much more efficient, but we \nstill need a much more equal and healthy society in other larger and \nprecedent problems to be able to deal with that. For example, many people \nwith a good education and social environment can understand the importance \nof developing clean energy (which I think it is a much more pressing \nmatter), but look how few really take action in this regard and how much \nour capitalist society has evolved in a way to block any attempts to change \nthat reality. Sometimes even that, which is much less integrated in to our \nemotional needs as food, it is difficult to argue with people.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12rszsyztvcttghj04cg5yzpyvugxrbp4w": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp4lTJ4ksKXzI418sdBOYcg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z-_6au7BcwI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIs/G3iY_Cu5vVE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MMArtist141", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-12-09T10:45:40.232Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCp4lTJ4ksKXzI418sdBOYcg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9626842000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-12-09T10:45:40.232Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114320300374562041059", "textDisplay": "Oh my god, retarded vegans.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13rs3z5guzyhdz2j231g5b41kmjtvzq204": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 22, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCWlhFkKWvNUzDYjqwv3n6A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fswzmyY0OKk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADQ/qxKBVgfoy3A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Anthony Rizzo", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-28T16:05:42.111Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCWlhFkKWvNUzDYjqwv3n6A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.072063999999999961, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-11-28T16:05:42.111Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105405687791430801900", "textDisplay": "Did you know the Bible says that God gave Adam and Eve a raw vegan fruit \nand grain based diet in the garden of Eden?

It is completely false that \nall sentient animals have an interest in their own lives let alone their \nown liberty, by definition of the word sentience.  \n\nSentience is defined as the \"ability to perceive subjectively\".  It is not \njust any sense of feeling, it has to be subjective.   If were any feeling \nthen plants would be sentient, no questions asked.  Does there exist a \nplant species that is more sentient than sponges?  Sponges are often not \nconsidered vegan (grey area).\n\nHow much can you perceive subjectively when you are asleep?  How sentient \nare you when you are asleep?  Can sentience and consciousness be \ninterchanged as if they are the same thing?  Which animal species are \nconsciousness?  When you are unconsciousness is there any changes to your \nrights?\n\nThe problem with the word sentience is that is tends to be a very \"top \ndown\" rather than \"bottom up\" characteristic.  Top down is where we give a \nhuman characteristic, in this case sentience, and then work our way \nbackwards until we find and organism that doesn't have that trait.  If you \ntake it from the bottom up you would expect that you should arrive at the \nsame conclusions about what life is sentient but instead you end up with \nhaving to give plants sentience or end up with having to give neurons \n\"magical\" significance. \n\nToo make it worse, neurons aren't even what senses damage tissue.  Those \nare nociceptors and while they are often called pain receptors this usage \nis not consistent with the modern definition of pain as a subjective \nexperience.

That is \njust the way nature is, no matter how horrible that sounds.  While I may \nagree with you that some of the meat-eater comments here were particularly \nstupid, I found it funny that your reasoning for being vegan was basically \nthat you shouldn't eat anything that can feel pain or displays awareness of \nits own mortality.\n\nI wonder if you are aware that plants can also feel pain?  They are aware \nof their surroundings, neighbors, and react when something nearby is \ninjured or dies.  They all have mechanisms that function, like animals, to \npreserve their own lives.  I have an article that I think you should read, \ncomplete with an interesting video at the bottom:  \nhttp://www.pri.org/stories/2014-01-09/new-research-plant-intelligence-may-forever-change-how-you-think-about-plants\n\nI won't get into the scientific problems I have with vegan diets, or the \nimpracticality of trying to live a vegan lifestyle for those of us who \ndon't live in fancy communities or have disposable cash to blow on a broad \nrange of crops which need to be imported from distant locales (Also that \nGraham Frost guy who posted here makes all of the points regarding that \nsubject that I could have wanted to make and more).  I just wanted to point \nout to you that the idea of not eating animals because they can feel pain \nand fear is outdated, as many of us know today that plants also feel pain \n(and very likely fear), and if you were to continue this thought train, you \nmay as well sit still and starve to death.  And if you don't believe me, I \ninvite you to do some research outside of your vegan websites and circle of \nfriends.\n\nTheoretically speaking, eating vegetables causes more pain and suffering \nover longer periods of time than not.  1 cow/chicken/pig/deer feeds many \npeople and dies quickly, but to feed a single person, potentially hundreds \nof plants must be uprooted and left to slowly die while they await being \nchewed to death.  At least the animal is dead when we eat its flesh. \n Tomorrow may be the harvest day for you, but to the plants and vegetables, \nits the holocaust.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13iep5hqyyzux0ot04cjlhg0wm5stbhuo40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD4v6NyjJJ2xmz-nftpVuwg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Answers721", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-21T04:35:28.059Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCD4v6NyjJJ2xmz-nftpVuwg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.55821999999999994, "formal_score": 90, "updatedAt": "2014-03-21T04:35:28.059Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116270998314751954544", "textDisplay": "Just wondering, what is your college degree in?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z125trtj3vqfetoso23iszj4wqrsyjaq304": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 33, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6ExcioKezufEJRX5bu_0w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CUcQHuy-ITA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/TQ78T3ItAD8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ozboybrian", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-05T22:04:58.882Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc6ExcioKezufEJRX5bu_0w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.39214199999999999, "formal_score": 42, "updatedAt": "2015-03-05T22:04:58.882Z", "likeCount": 44, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103348947332927647924", "textDisplay": "People actually think animals are Machines? wtf?

Your argument is whoever \ndoesn't do exactly what you tell them to do is a \"one-sided thinker\". \nThat's the dumbest thing ever.

You know, up there with \nevolution... or maybe I need to prove evolution as well. Because fuck high \nschool, it's my job to teach you all the basics of biology. \n\nI just linked to Webster's dictionary using animals as part of the official \ndefinition of the word. But, he didn't watch Earthlings blah blah blah. \nWhat's funny is, although I didn't have to watch Earthlings, out of \ncuriosity I did. And you know what I had realized 5 minutes into it... that \nI had seen it before. That movie is actually a big part of why I hold my \ncurrent opinions. \n\n0% of the meat I eat was processed in this way. I even told you the farm I \nbuy my beef from so you could see for yourself the process. So your \nargument isn't that we need to not torture animals, it's that we shouldn't \nkill them at all. And that's something I simply don't think makes any \nsense. I explained why I'm team human above all else. And your dumb ass \nresponse was, I love the Starfishes the same that I love my family... \nknowing you don't. And when I called you on that broken piece of logic then \nhere comes the name-calling. \n\nIdiots like you are why people like me have a hard time even hearing this \nside of the fences arguments. Just nonsensical drivel, and group think, and \nif you don't agree then we'll resort to high school tactics. Guess what... \ndoesn't work on me. I eat probably a pound of meat a day and I will \ncontinue to. Why, because I'm selfish, just like you are. I put my family \nfirst, my country second, my species next, and other animals fourth. So if \na dog is biting a human, I don't ask why I shoot the dog in the face. If \nthe US wants to go conquer China, I don't say \"but they are people too\" I \nsay, make sure all Americans are going to benefit from this war. And if my \nneighbor disrespects my mother, I'm beating him bloody. This is the chain \nof logic that we both most likely live by, but that you don't claim. It's \nno different than arguing with a Christian about morality.\n\n\"I love all animals equally\" is the equivalent of saying \"God is good\". \nNonsensical drivel that sounds good to dummies, but that's it."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_GEAac1gJxB9E3--iUgdPg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Herr X", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125trtj3vqfetoso23iszj4wqrsyjaq304", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-06T16:03:07.399Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_GEAac1gJxB9E3--iUgdPg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.027088000000000001, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-06T16:42:07.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-F7u8E7Movlw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMk/plce4FnGxNA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115316592065839564167", "textDisplay": "+ozboybrian I see"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6ExcioKezufEJRX5bu_0w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ozboybrian", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125trtj3vqfetoso23iszj4wqrsyjaq304", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-06T15:23:44.576Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc6ExcioKezufEJRX5bu_0w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.89818819999999999, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-06T15:23:44.576Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CUcQHuy-ITA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/TQ78T3ItAD8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103348947332927647924", "textDisplay": "+Mr X Don't feed the troll mate.

So \nI'll just stick with two.\nFirst, nutritional requirements. I could go on at length, but I'm sure \nyou've heard it all. The mere fact that we have to go to such great lengths \nto obtain animal-based nutrients (manufacturing B-12 from bacteria, \ncombining many non-native plant based foods for complete proteins, etc.) \nonly reinforces the necessity for meat. If we are to accept that humans are \nanimals, we must also accept that regardless of intellect and morality, we \nare still part of the food chain. Which leads me to my second point.\n\nMorality of eating meat. There is an obvious conflict here. I will agree \nthat animals are sentient and they do experience a wide range of emotions. \nI will agree that doing something \"just because you like it,\" is \nwrong...although equating eating meat with rape is ludicrous. I don't think \nany rape victim has ever been quoted as saying, \"You know when you buy a \nsteak from the grocery store? Well, it was just like that.\" I will also \nagree that most livestock are kept in deplorable conditions. Actually, \nthere's nothing to agree with...it's just a fact.\n\nBut although animals may feel similar emotions to humans, they aren't \nhumans. A sheep does not contemplate its own mortality, a cow does not feel \ndisappointment, and a rabbit does not wonder about life after death. \nKilling an animal may seem inhumane, but again, we're part of the food \nchain. It's a necessity. Decapitating a chicken may sound cruel, but I've \nseen what a raccoon does to one. \n\nHumans may eat meat largely because \"we just like it.\" But we like it \nbecause we need it. We are animals, no different than a big fish who eats a \nlittle fish, or a wolf who eats a deer. The difference is that we have the \noption of not tearing an animal apart while it's still alive.\n\nAnd if you want to point fingers about the horrible livestock conditions, \npoint at marketing and advertising. At least here in the U.S., we are \nconstantly bombarded with ads telling us to eat more, eat bigger, consume, \nconsume, consume. I'd hazard a guess that the typical American (my \nhypocritical self included) eats more meat in a day than they need in a \nweek. But as long as there is a demand, there will be a large corporation \ncapitalizing on it, ethics be damned.\n\nBut what if we did switch to a plant-based diet, en masse? Well of course \nthe big corporations would shift from livestock to agriculture. The fields \nused for animal feed could then be used to grow food for humans. Livestock \nrelated pollution would diminish. And once-domesticated animals could \nreturn to a broader part of the ecosystem. But would the big corporations \npractice responsible, sustainable farming? Would the advertisers still push \nus to eat more and more of the higher-profit crops? How would the \nmega-farms keep up with demands for higher yields? Genetic modification? \nMore aggressive pesticides?

I \ndo not doubt that animals have consciousness and the nervous system in \nanimals confirms that. However, there are degrees of consciousness, sort of \nlike a light on a dimmer switch. You can have consciousness that is capable \nof momentary emotion, but not sustained emotion. You can have consciousness \ncapable of sustained emotion, but not comparative emotion. You can have \nconsciousness capable of comparative emotion, but not abstract emotion, \netc. (And this is simply in the category of emotions.) The more capable the \nmind, the more types of thoughts it can entertain. That heightened level of \nintelligence (which you conceded in your first response to me) and \nreasoning of each human and their cultural sensibilities and complex \nemotions, etc. that make every human life worth saving to a degree superior \nto that of animals.\n\nAs for the kill-counter, we can ask the reverse question. How many of those \nanimals would have lived if not for the meat industry? Again, I think you \ncan have a serious ethical debate about whether it would be better if fewer \nanimals lived than more animals lived and died. A second issue is that a \nkill-counter will naturally skew towards the type of animals that we \ndomesticate because they live short lives naturally. Cows, pigs, chickens, \netc. live for around a decade or less, so naturally, their life-cycle will \nend more quickly. That it is being expedited increases the number only \nslightly.\n\nAs for the vegan diet, I was never worried that such a diet is impossible; \nI am sure there is a way to make the diet work with new and inventive plant \ncombinations and supplements. However, you are of the view that it is a \nmoral imperative to abstain from animal meat and, up to this point, I do \nnot hold that you have adequately addressed the intelligence issue save to \nnote that the choice of intelligence is arbitrary. I would say that it is \nnot since intelligence is a direct indicator of the value of a life being \nlived, in most circumstances, and of its value to society."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI_KL8ACRvuGfl9oXlepkw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Christopher \u201cChris\u201d Martin", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12fjf5xyzvicvcbs04ci3vyaoj5htb4v1c", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-15T19:06:25.767Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZI_KL8ACRvuGfl9oXlepkw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.20840600000000004, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-15T19:06:25.767Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8Z2i3Hud72w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAmU/DmvqpzTCifw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112778347975655653962", "textDisplay": "What if we bread an animal thatwas lliterally physiologically incapable of \npain and suffering, would any of you eat it then?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnLIG1_uFcZSX1eHq-XGhyA", "inappropriate_score": 0.78431372549019607, "authorDisplayName": "julkkis666", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12fjf5xyzvicvcbs04ci3vyaoj5htb4v1c", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-15T19:03:33.514Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnLIG1_uFcZSX1eHq-XGhyA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.046051999999999982, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-15T19:03:33.514Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4RcT1qKdkTw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPY/lOE6Jscz6yA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117523475665484753942", "textDisplay": "+Dani Mu\u00f1oz Guardiola i agree with what you copypasted. but the thing is, \nit says nothing about \"and thus we should not eat meat.\" you know?\n\nthe reason people still eat meat today in western society, is that people \nare not willing to lower their own life standards for the reasons one would \nstop eating meat. ether add something to one side, or take something away \nfrom the other and more people will become vegans. i myself don't hunt down \nmeat like \"OH FUCK I NEED MEAT IM SO  FUCKING BLOOD THIRSTY RIGTH NOW!

A lack of intelligence is something \nthat we have historically, and I would argue rightly, discriminated for. \nFor example, we do not let children enter contracts because we claim that \nthey are not intelligent enough to understand the consequences.

are animals, nothing more, and nothing less. Some animals \neat plants like horses, deer, and giraffes.They are known as herbivores. \nOthers eat meat like lions, sharks, and crocodiles. They are known as \ncarnivores. While others eat both meat, and plants like bear, monkeys, and \nhumans. We are in a group called omnivores. \n\n(Remember when you learned that stuff back in grade school?...Now just keep \nthat thought cooking in that grey matter you call a brain for a moment)\n\nNow, you've also acknowledged that we are nothing more than animals sharing \na space on this blue speck that we lovingly call Earth. As a fellow \nmammal/primate on this planet, we tend to do things just like our fellow \nrelated creatures do (ie: we bleed, eat, shit, fuck, and die just like the \nrest of our distant cousins do).\n\n We are not better than the other animals, we are just smarter than them. \nSo, why do you have this huge superiority complex that your veganism is \nsomehow more dynamic, and more moral than someone who chooses to do what's \nnatural, and eat both meat and vegetable. I'm sure your aware that the \nhuman body is anatomically designed to eat both meat, and vegetables right?\n\nYou made a choice in not eating meat. Good for you, way to not eat meat!! \nOther's made a choice to eat both; it's human nature, so get over it. \nAgain, if we were not meant to eat meat, then we would not be biologically \ndesigned to do so. \n\nIf we could keep the Christians out of Politics, and Schools....and keep \nthe Vegans out of our refrigerators, then life would be even more amazing!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true},

It is therefore \nabsolutely possible to keep chicken (in species-appropriate conditions of \ncourse) without exploiting them especially if you don't keep an \nindustrialized breed (so that their bodies are not destroyed by the large \nquantities of eggs they have to pump out). It should go without saying that \nindustrial farming of hens isn't only an environmental hazard but also \nanimal cruelty of the highest degree and should be abolished. I don't see a \ngood argument against keeping them in good conditions (only for their eggs).\n\nInsects like honey bees are not able to suffer in any meaningful way (as \nfar as we know). It is save to say they don't have any concept of liberty, \nself determination or anything resembling a capability for emotional \nresponses. It is therefore completely ridiculous to call the farming of \nbees \"exploitation\". The ridiculousness of this comment and your own \nignorance on the topic seems obvious when we consider that honey is \nsubstituted by a solution of sugar and nutrients for the bees, so that they \ndon't feel a meaningful impact on the hives health. Honey bees are also \nmuch more industrious than their wild counterparts and thereby able to \ndistribute pollen much more significantly (but they are also more fragile \nand therefore sometimes require human support). The argument for symbiosis \nbetween the species is also not as facile as you would like it to be, since \nhumans provide their bees with shelter, food and medicine in return for \ntheir labor (I have already explained why its not like slavery). The link \nyou provided is just another example of such fallacious arguments and whole \nunscientific. What can not suffer (and will never be able to) and isn't \neven really scentient is not worthy of moral considerations.\n\nThe often repeated argument that honey is \"bee vomit\" (and eggs are chicken \nmenstruation) and should therefore not be eaten is nothing but a red \nherring fallacy called the argument from disgust (coined by the YouTuber \nTMM; something is morally wrong because I find it to be repulsive. often \nused by Christians and Muslims to argue against gay marriage).\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ngb55nkqefjvhj04cet2rznzli1jhkjk": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 26, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1J6nOnTXnBiXNK15mmu-A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-coOeWRIZ5Bg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEU/DZXFaUXBXEI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Muddy Fudger", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-20T22:02:44.048Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCN1J6nOnTXnBiXNK15mmu-A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.60158800000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-09-20T22:02:44.048Z", "likeCount": 8, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101901891642736222710", "textDisplay": "Oh great, another channel trying to shove their own shittastic beliefs down \npeople's throats.

You can even make your own. I personally \ndon't eat yogurt, but the coconut one I have tried was good. \nClothing: Keep in mind that there are many vegan who shop at thrift stores \nand would rather buy stuff that was made in those factories than throw it \naway. Some people still have the same clothes they had before they were \nvegan and choose to keep it rather than waste it by throwing it out. There \nis also lack of accessibility since, unfortunately, over 90% of clothes out \nthere are from sweatshops. Lastly, there is the fact that some cannot \nafford the cost of non-sweatshop clothing or some may have been given \nthings as gifts. As you can see there are many different reasons. For me, I \nhave a lot of the same old clothes from years ago because I maintain my \nweight and I also shop for some clothes as thrift shores.\nDiet: Simply eat more fruits and vegetables. I'm on a cleanse right now of \njust raw fruits and vegetables and it is amazing. Many people do it as a \nlifestyle. Just make sure you are eating a variety of whole food and not \npackaged foods. Learn to cook and get creative; there are so many recipes \nout there. You don't need any more than 5% protein. Not only is that the \nrecommended amount by the World Health Organization (they found only 2.5% \nwas needed, but doubled it for good measure), but also it makes sense that \nwe don't need more than that because when you are a baby, you are \ndeveloping the fastest and human breast milk has about 5% so we never need \nmore than that. No vegan has every had a protein deficiency. Kwashiorkor is \nonly found in poor countries where there is not enough food or people who \nare anorexic. I used Cronometer to measure my macros on this raw fruit and \nveg diet and I am actually getting 5% each day just eating mostly fruit. Of \ncourse, if that isn't good enough (if you want to body build or something) \nthere is always beans, tofu, lentils, nuts, peas, brown rice, ect. Watch \nout though because there is actually a huge problem right now with people \nhaving too much protein; we only need a little bit.\nB12: B12 is actually a bacteria found in soil. If it weren't for soil \ndepletion from use of pesticides, we would have enough B12 on our organic \nplants that we consume. The B12 that's needed is a very small amount and \ncan easily be supplemented. I've heard injections are the best way to do \nthat. I use a tablet, but I'm thinking of switching. Unfortunately, because \nof modern agriculture, that's the only option. Also note that many of the \nlivestock now is being supplemented because they are not being feed organic \ngrass anyway. We also have a storage of B12 in our body and I've heard \nthat, unless you become really sick, it should stay at a constant supply.\nBenefit to humans: Animals products to not benefit humans. It makes them \nsick. Look at people around you. They are overweight, tired, need caffeine \njust to get anything done, they're grumpy/moody, they can't think straight \nand they are consumed by society's standards. What you put in is what you \nget out. You put in death, torture and abuse and you don't get out anything \ngood.\nCheers!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcrDq8icHICHywUvTDMwSBQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Raffaella Ciavatta", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12mebpaqrfvznvsc22gfth5funntn1k1", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-21T19:13:35.073Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCcrDq8icHICHywUvTDMwSBQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.97638200000000008, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-21T19:13:35.073Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4c12eSXjw3E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABLM/mp12PrxRgsg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107122969472750341463", "textDisplay": "coconut or almond yogurt!\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=almond+yogurt&client=firefox-a&hs=CER&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&tbm=isch&imgil=SpaNzDOlIzbWyM%253A%253Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fencrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com%252Fimages%253Fq%253Dtbn%253AANd9GcTg7juhs2UTTam82rNODSSKI3ubiuvdjw-BbMo48PMoqwcF3Xku%253B422%253B281%253B9YVRgbpUz17QDM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.refrigeratedfrozenfood.com%25252Fkeywords%25252F3171-almond-dream-yogurt&source=iu&usg=__4esgPOmXEa8hj6tFqWMqCtUQ8CU%3D&sa=X&ei=TY8sU4-8NMfKrQGdjYH4Dw&ved=0CEgQ9QEwAg#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=SpaNzDOlIzbWyM%253A%3B9YVRgbpUz17QDM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.refrigeratedfrozenfood.com%252Fext%252Fresources%252Fimages%252FAlmond-Dream-yogurt-422.jpg%253F1346429738%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.refrigeratedfrozenfood.com%252Fkeywords%252F3171-almond-dream-yogurt%3B422%3B281\nSO GOOD"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTjWBzr5O_plnIFaGekOwow", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Darth Elvis", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12mebpaqrfvznvsc22gfth5funntn1k1", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-21T08:05:02.024Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTjWBzr5O_plnIFaGekOwow"}, "sentiment_score": -0.57180000000000009, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-21T08:05:02.024Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8z61iceDfyY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFM/1tUGPurUm6k/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114184810003806805074", "textDisplay": "Morals are subjective if you really want to be honest about it."}}]}, "z133zrk5onqzifxds22tcddwatjrjl5yr04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 6, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf6C3OBzgr4JCXzm7ZZQqkg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sL7BAal9b2k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/ai91z21Y2dY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "PrimitivePatri0t", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-15T16:23:49.237Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCf6C3OBzgr4JCXzm7ZZQqkg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.71257999999999999, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-09-15T16:23:49.237Z", "likeCount": 6, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101569916141567311217", "textDisplay": "You have the most dry, humorless personality I've ever come across.

Processed meat and food with additives and excess sugar intake is \nresponsible for a lot of health issues. Also, the more educated a person \nis, in my opinion, the more likely they are to consider dropping meat. \nUnfortunately this demographic is still small relative to the larger \npopulation. Although I think it's beneficial to continue to put the word \nout there, there does need to be a compromise. Yes, slaughtering an animal \nfor food is not a good thing. Yes, meat producers treat animals poorly \nbefore they are killed. However, I personally do support programs like \nthose implemented by Whole Foods that grade suppliers on their practices. \nUnfortunately again, Whole Foods is a place that targets the wealthier \ndemographic rather than those consumers that actively support the large \nscale meat suppliers.

I see no reason to torture or abuse animals in just about \nany circumstance. I see no reason not to make sure their harvest is swift \nand as painless as possible.  There are reasons to be or not to be vegan. \n Its really a dubious idea. And for many, an impossible and likely harmful \none as the resource for food maybe limited.\nSometimes reason reveals we have biases, at the heart of those biases there \nisn't any meaning, that we just define the undefined equation arbitrarily. \n I think the entire vegan thing is like religion. Its a way to see meaning \nin the meaningless using argument of ignorance (we don't know if plants \nactually suffer or not), reductio ad absurdum (extreme nature of avoiding \nall meat), circular argument (there really isn't any actual value assigned \nto biology), and potentially special pleading (if it does happen that we \nfind plants to suffer).  \nVegans have a dubious position only to projecting their egos just as the \nposition of religions do for other people.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12fcflg4oe3chx5q04chv4yiln3s5myi2k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdJZQsuTYWYmi17PD-BcLRg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Z0RyZFJSE3g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFf8/8UqHHKR6BvA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Xavier Glover", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-09T17:29:02.712Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdJZQsuTYWYmi17PD-BcLRg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2014-08-09T17:29:02.712Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110154175355724604367", "textDisplay": "4\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13dd5hrjly3ttfhl04cdjn5vtyetnhrrr40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUjeZ0ZUnTGfn3pgQXgWUKQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-j0Rh40tb720/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/Kl0pKc7OmSs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Slayedjudas666", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-21T17:41:18.150Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUjeZ0ZUnTGfn3pgQXgWUKQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.74842800000000009, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-03-21T17:41:18.150Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104190900061940722337", "textDisplay": "Youre religion bashing videos are pretty good but this ist just ridiculous. \nHumans are omnivores not herbivores.

It is argued that only \ncreatures with a central nervous system can suffer.\n\nOysters are essentially the plant equivalent of the animal kingdom. They \nbasically stick to a rock and stay there. They may not have any of the five \nsenses. They have no eyes, no nose, no ears, no tongue, and possibly are \nunable to feel temperature, pleasure, or pain.\nUnlike clams who are able to pump water (flap their shells) to escape \npossible harm, oysters do not. They seem to have no desire or make no \nattempt to escape from harm.\n\n\nThe debate on pain is there. \nThey say if you pour lemon juice on oysters they may twitch. But the \ntwitching could be from being able to sense chemicals. \nOr to create a pearl a grain of sand must be inserted inside the oyster. \nThe sand turns into a pearl to prevent irritation. But I can't imagine that \nfrom being any different than our own body's reactions to foreign bodies.\n\nThere are highly sustainable methods of raising farmed oysters that \nactually benefit the ecosystem.\n\nThough there is no sufficient proof that oysters can feel pain, there is \nalso no proof they can't. I cannot compare an animal's capacity of pain and \njustify eating something such as a fish because their severity of pain is \nperceived to be lesser than a pig's severity of pain.\n\nI do not eat oysters and I don't particularly plan to.\n\nIt is not necessary for me to eat oysters, though they seem to be high in \nB12, which is something I cant get from plants alone but only through \nsupplements and fortified foods. B12 is a bacteria and technically isn't \nproduced by plants or animals but breed in animal flesh and secretions. \n\nI cannot argue against others eating oysters effectively. So if someone \nwere to drop every animal product with the exception of responsibly raised \noysters I wouldn't find it necessary to persuade them to drop oysters from \ntheir diet too. \n\n\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12dhrnyyx23jjhkf221wxjzfmbzdp2be04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLPmC1AQv1qACSiz2iyFujQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UZBFp-xBXhY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABw/iN2FBcqSSPE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.66225165562913912, "authorDisplayName": "Mustache Guy", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-03T19:08:21.323Z", "videoId": "N6RkrbrCzbg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLPmC1AQv1qACSiz2iyFujQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.26120600000000005, "formal_score": 15, "updatedAt": "2015-01-03T19:08:21.323Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117960004808012606497", "textDisplay": "First comment: \"Animals aren't conscious\" HOW FUCKING OBNOXIOUS!
