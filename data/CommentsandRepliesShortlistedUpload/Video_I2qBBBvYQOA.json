But,  he still considers himself basically a virgin \nbecause he didn't \"enjoy\" it. People like this have severe mental issues \nand nothing will ever be good enough for them. If women weren't the issue, \nthey would find something else to blame their unhappiness on. It's a shame \nbecause besides Elliot's narcissitic personality, he seemed like a very \nnice, polite, and cool guy. Pretty funny too. You could tell their was also \na very great side to him too. He had the abillity to really appreciate the \nbeautiful world we live in (clearly excluding his personal life with \nfriends, women, and any aspect of his social life). You can also tell he \nwas very smart by the way he spoke. Waste of talent. He could have a been a \ngreat comedian, honestly he had me cracking up about how into himself he \nwas.  Or, could have been a successful businessman who knows. The one thing \nI would like to know is did he ever actually approach women? Did he ever \ntry to hit on girls, or hang out with peers at college parties? He says he \ndid, but clearly his perception on his life was far from reality.

Women are definitely playing with fire in society, though. They \nkeep playing the good and evil game; goes way back into history. In other \nwords, its justified of cause and affect of life. This kingdom forces men \nin poverty or low standing as military options as the only escape. Thus \nthen its legal to kill and be trained to kill for a kingdom/empire. God \nreally. Every nation is against god, every nation has a standing army. Who \nbuilds all this stuff? Who invents it. With social engineering removing \nformal training of civility and ethics, for a forced \"multicultural \nsociety\", one is bound to have some conflicts arise and more. Lots of men \nare angry because women seem to be over protected and given strange rights \nin society. Social system has caused the system to be out of balance. In \nthe correct manner it could work well but it is far from being utilized in \na manner that is apt for a society. Thus we have the cattle (women) \nendangering the breeding of the species because of money and other \nstipulations. Socrates said it best, majority of women are petty. Men are \nforced to build for whore of society that breed out of control; no order or \nhi MAT. It is a organic chaos. Holy ghost, motherhood training, calm, \nbalanced and slow approach is seemingly missing from society, as it is a \nburning mind of fire, never settling. Divorce and all these congealing \nideals in opposition to the self of the self to the selfless nature of \nthings that give. Nazis got children to breed out of control for building \nan army and they found that it created, humans that were like ghosts in a \nway. Not at all what they expected.\n\nA nation that accepts and forces one to kill, while putting imbecilic \nbehavior in high places deserves whatever comes its way. Cruelty befalls \ncruelty and mortifying a heart is a crime that one is not supposed to do. \nThe current make-up of the society dependent on monetary ratio forces one \not be a whore in that manner. It seems the courting habits has adopted NAzi \nsocial engineering for dating. In this regard you have accident families. \nThus a plethora of single useless mothers, because they have not learnt \nanything to raise a family. The public school system is a complete failure. \nRemoving family training and teaching strange things. I could go around abd \nbe a womanizer, a whore, serve myself but I mean what values does one \noperate. What the generation of people are doing I would find their \nbehavior unsuitable and their conduct a danger to the future of society. \nThe goals people have is, make money, fornicate and serve oneself. hardly \nachieving any great works towards anything on this earth. As prince Philip \ncan be quoted, Useless consumers.\n\nA devious women tries to hard her lawless ness, but if a word exists it \nthen too also can exist. f morality was at its height I guarantee you, \nthere would be more and more wars still. Because in my opinion logical \npeople protect the logical and reasonable foundations of life and the true \nliberty's. Moving and changing and arguing about laws and creating biases \nare tricks of the enemy and grant no freedom, but bondage and chaos. It \nchanges a just standard to a standard of governance to a puppetry game. \nWhile that is going on real things behind the scenes happen. Explore the 15 \ncentury in what people considered the liberties. The real arts. Instead \nthis is just a genocide and extermination against a certain sect and \npeople, somewhat well crafted, but not that well. I will say it again. \nCause and affect. Don't take that apple(fruit) for surely you will taste \ndeath. There is always that wrath. Nature has its programed checks and \nbalances, when injustice meets injustice. Its on both sides. A den of \nthieves becomes a brood of vipers. If one thinks about it, the world is \nmissing something, yet they cannot see it. funny really. If money didn't \nexist, balance and civility of another order would exist. Cities are just \nharvest nodes for resources that sell or play on the sin of the city to \nreap mountains of illusions. I at times wish I really was unscrupulous.\n\nI forced the poor man to dig his grave, I forced him to build my ships of \nand chariots of war. I forced him still again to take the lie. Then there \nwas that time a puzzling fellow came and left. he said if men could live \nalone by their hearts what marvels they could create. So as it were in a \nthief of a night the kingdom was taken away. What fruit does one fornicate \nwith now. What perverse or pervasive means do they damage the human psyche? \nThere is a war brewing, but a war unlike any other wars.\n\nNot all women are like that. My advice to men.\nHere is poor adive, just use women that give it away to easy and always \nwrap.\n\nHere is better advice. Go to school in a need profession. Ignore women and \ntheir lies and nonsense and childish schemes. They will have their day. \nThen when you want to settle down, just find one, since there are not many \nladies these days or virgins. Basically they just a bunch of protected \nwhores by a corrupt governing body. They make agreements and then get an \noffspring. Then divorce and protect your children and re-educate them away \nfrom this society, under the guise of modernization. That's imo. since this \nsocial engineering of happiness and fun, is worse then a hundred sword \nbrandishing drunks in its destructiveness. Should one write lude and \nprovocative statements to get attention to earn illicit money. They are \ncasting fire unto the world with the things they say and do. However, do \nnot listen or take anything I say with any truth. The world is a strange \nplace. Right now it is forcefully dictating over all nations and against \nall cultures. In fact people don't even know what culture is anymore. \nIllegal entities marked are the IMF, UN, NAFTA, FREE TRADE, Globalization. \nSeriously murdering and transgressions going on. Funny though. My life \nwould be completely different if by one simple act was changed. Thus I \nWould have never had the opportunity to analyze the earth in its functions. \nOne could say I was asleep until an act had occurred. What sadness it \nbrings to see the earth as such. It's like love is being erased in a \nstrange way, for the guise of lawless love, lust or carnal nature of love. \nIn some regard babies are needed, but cities would not have been made in \nsuch debasement if built on the real principles of love. What exactly are \nthe actions one is doing? What are they really \"serving\" Who is this \nshadowy master? Funny how the enemy gloats in the front page. Stating now \nMigrant workers are needed! Because the self autonomy has been lost. \nMeaning the community can no longer self support itself because of the \ninflux of people driven by the box stores, as an extermination process. A \njust man or a rational persons would not breed or copulate in an \nenvironment ofa bunch of deranged fornicators. Nice and kindness are over \nrated when subjected to reality. These are civilties, but its like a fire \nsale. people literally stealing the labours of the men by seducing there \nwives and or using the social system and immediately having children. This \nis quite a silly paradox. How this effects the earth. The earth is far from \nover populated, The condensed ratio is at dangerous levels for creating a \nbalanced community. I don't mind traveling the world, but wy move else \nwhere and screw it up just as much. Funny they (corporate) entities de \nmoralized the parliament and sound structures for short temporary gain to \ncreate a class or empire based society. Father of lies is up to his no good \nagain.  SOUND GOOD MAN IS ALWAYS FREE. Just seems to be always so many \nobstacles of lost souls, looking for only ever earthly directions and \ncarnal things. If but they ever gazed and held heavenly or godly things in \ntheir sight, perhaps they would not behave as they do, as swine. Which is \nthe worst of worst places ot be subjected. Burns and toils the mind and \nonly strengthen the resolves of ones laws to that of which is in comparison \nagainst civility. It sounds  cruel, but at what mark to we ourselves \nsubject out minds to such debauchery? Should not one have freedom to act \nand be civil with cleanliness of mind. That pristine though. What is \nnormal? What is good.\n\nBack to this. I feel sorry for him. I attract lots of women. I deny \neveryone of them. Disgusting things they do all of them over and over. \nprogrammed nature to deceive, so a man waits until they grow up and are \nreal. Rather then children, rebelling and do naughty thigns as rebellious \nacts, in reality they debase and put the species at risk and themselves. \nIts like a short sighted selfish mind. Definitely a lot of something \nmissing in the minds of a lot of the women I have come across. Serial \nliars, abusers, narcists, agreers (these ones are empty no thoughts just \nyes to everything)... etc.. My goodness I need something real, LMAO. \nAnyways with my rant aside. The Little Prince is my recommended book for \nall the world ot read. it is so deep and tearful. Maybe I need to go talk \nto a snake and return to whence I came.\n\nFinding a GF is not hard. Finding a women that has mother attributes, that \nhas the correct stubborn will in a good natured spirit, with well developed \nvirtues for family building is tough. Anything else is temporally \nirrelevant, toward the end resolve.  Most people are completely devoid of \nthe end resolve., they never seen what society is being underlined and \ngrafted towards.

Thus now we have the most injust rising to \nthe apparent societal reigns; persuading people out of their labours, works \nand homes nad libraries of knowledge they worked and procured, through the \njust means; terribly dishearting. imo. Who cares, its TL;dr. That's the \nnormalcy of what you get when you interbreed disgusting slave stock to free \nstock. A savage that serves its master without thought but for the \nallowances of reward. An unrealistic position of reality. When someone \nlike, \" David S. Says white supremacy stills exists.

Thus, then I can not myself develop any land, Simply \nbecause that which I should have has been stolen and take nor given away \nwithout right of principle. In that regard it is most unholy who are thee \napparent most high. What and who fell the beasts. This all goes back to \nwars upon wars. twenty years the migration of these third world indiciuals \nstole all the labours and manipulated the wealth away from the women \nthrough seduction and basically become dead cities, dead places. Dirty and \ndisgusting. Feel the heat of death upon them, life sapped from its roots. \nIn my rationalization, all I see from the years of proghanda is constant \nadvertising saying, that we must give them what we have. What good does \nthat do? With a bunch of non doers orworkers ,but thieves. Just as the \nthieves that stole a kingdom, the Rothschild and their murdeious family \nways, no different then the Manchurian dynasty's or bankers. They force and \ncommand over people and steal. Distrust? Well yeah, when there this organic \nsubmissive society programmed towards fiat currency that is adopting a \npractice of thievery. Funny, one would think if one hails from al ine of \npeople that built part of the foundation of the beginning that they would \nhave something, instad, justa bunch of drunker, bandits and murderious \nthieves, that are only nice if they are fed and consuming new trinkets on a \ndaily basis. Too me that is complete madness and an act of cunning. One \nshould then look upon what is built and then build it them selves and in \nproper oder one can do it quite quickly and efficiently. Instead... This \nworld is, quite something else; planet of the apes. That is my opinion. \nWithout leadership and proper... apparent parental type leaders because the \nherd behaves like children and or behaves in nasty ways of mule or abusive \nexploitation... it deserves what it gets.

Even though one of them, a guy called Stan, he got \nalong with very well. Elliot was the kind of person who can never be \nsatisfied. He said he wanted friends, then he got some. But he wanted to be \nfriends with 'the beautiful people' as he called them: the jocks and pretty \nblondes. He saw himself as 'beautiful' and therefore 'worthy' of joining \nthem, but at the same time was terrified of their apparent ease and \nconfidence and felt they'd all reject him (which, let's face it, they would \nhave), yet at the same time as this, he actually despised these 'beautiful \npeople'. He wanted to go to parties, yet considered hip-hop 'annoying \nmusic' and beer pong to be 'a crude drinking game\".  \n\n\nSo anyway, eventually, even the Andi friends got fed up of him and couldnt \nbear hanging out with him, but Elliot didnt mourn their loss, because 'they \nwerent popular and their friendship was benefiting me\". Unfortunately, \nautistic disorders seem to render people devoid of empathy and they just \nsee people to be used. You can check out a forum called Love-shy:its full \nof these people talking about how they are going to 'use fat chicks as \npractice\": so, date a 'fat ugly chick' (their words) move in with her and \npractise being with a woman until confident, then ditch her and move onto \nbetter-looking girls....as if carrying some extra weight means you have no \nfeelings..or, more likely, those feelings dont matter because all that \ncounts is their horrible selves. \n\n\nSometimes Elliot sounds, like so many Aspies, to be middle-aged. Its like \nthey are never young. So even if he had got into such a group, he'd never \nhave been happy and if he'd got the hot blonde party girl, he'd have wanted \nher to stay home all the time.

I introduced my buddy who was fucking \nlingering by the trees and well he finally had the balls to say \"Hi\" in a \nmumbling manner to the girl (Girl 1) I set him up with. Long-story short, I \nleave him alone with the girl (Girl 1) and I end up converting with \nKelly(Girl 2) (We've been together for 3 years now with no regret) and well \nit oddly turns out that Kelly wanted to crack the shell that (Girl 1) was \nin by introducing her to a nice guy. I was obviously excited by what she \nsaid! By the end of the day... I looked back at my buddy from afar and I \nsee him sitting down on a hill with the girl ...That was the first time I \never saw him laugh and smile. I don't know how this bastard did it ,but he \nends up kissing her before we leave and he also receives her phone #. David \nand Emily are their names and I swear they do the weirdest shit that \ncouples do lol! I'm just happy I was there for David... I don't know what \nlife would have been for him if we never went on this trip or MET! I feel \nfor E.Roger ,but what he did was unforgivable. Damn! He just needed a \nfucking WINGMAN! A true BRO!      \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOypjqO0NgPqV-m3avgMGLg", "inappropriate_score": 1.5075376884422111, "authorDisplayName": "Matthew H", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z130hpvanyiucpy5204cepsynk2zv5njiz40k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-16T06:03:21.056Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOypjqO0NgPqV-m3avgMGLg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.394484, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-16T06:03:21.056Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--0K0beYcK9c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPc/gLWPYMbdJ1w/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109324029203394566544", "textDisplay": "Exactly!

Imagine that he never had any friends, he was BY \nHIMSELF for 22 years, noone never gave him a good example, noone explained \nhim how life works, noone told him what is bad and what is good and again- \nnoone raised him!

I said that it DOESN'T JUST \nhappen in California. \n\nResearch, bring it on.  As a nurse I have been writing research papers for \n20 years.\n\nIn a study done in 2010 the states with higher gun violence (the top 10 \nbeing Louisiana, Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi, So. Carolina, New \nMexico, Missouri, Arkansas & Georgia) had much less stringent gun laws \n(i.e. no permit required to purchase a handgun) than other states with less \nviolence like New Jersey, Connecticut and Hawaii. In the 10 states with the \nlowest gun violence, seven had this requirement, including all six states \nwith the lowest levels of gun violence. \n\nSo, how does gun ownership relate to homicide rates? It's not simple. For \ninstance, the United States has over 12 times as many guns per person as \nHonduras, but the 2012 US gun homicide rate per 100,000 people (2.97) is \n1/22 of Honduras' (68.43). That's because, while guns make murder easier, \nwealthy industrialized countries generally have significantly lower rates \nof violent crime than comparatively impoverished ones.\n\nBut when you compare the United States to nations like Britain and Japan, \nit becomes clear that firearm ownership contributes to America's murder \nproblem. The American firearm homicide rate is about 20 times the average \namong Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries \n(excluding Mexico).\"   \nhttp://www.vox.com/2014/6/11/5797892/us-world-firearm-ownership-map\n\nHere's a link you should read if you think that more gun ownership will \ndecrease death by gun.  (it's peer reviewed, unlike Fox news):\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/09/13/2617131/largest-gun-study-guns-murder/\n\nSaying EVERY mass shooting happens in gun free zones where people are not \nallowed to have guns, well that is just pure b.s. Yes most of these \nshooters target places where people feel safe.  Schools, shopping malls, \nchurches, places of work....  but not all are gun free zones, here's a few \nexamples.\n\nArmy Specialist Ivan Lopez opened fire at the Fort Hood Army base killing 3 \npeople and injuring 16 before turning the gun on himself. \n\nArmy psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, opened fire at the Fort Hood army post \nkills 13 and injures 29.  This guy was suffering from PTSD.\n\nNavy reservist Aaron Alexis, 34, killed 12 people at the Washington Navy \nYard, near the U.S. Capitol.\n\n(Please don't tell me you think that an Army or Navy base is a gun free \nzone.)\n\nMaurice Clemmons, a felon, entered a coffee shop and shot 4 police \nofficers, all 4 officers were armed.\n\nA Virginia Tech police officer was shot and killed by a 22-year old student \nof Radford University (and yes he had his gun with him)\n\nThe political debate over gun rights has made it appear impossible to \nregulate firearms without sacrificing the Second Amendment. And the \nconnection between guns and violence is not as simple as \u201cguns cause crime\u201d \nor \u201cguns make us safer.\u201d There is scientific evidence, however, that some \npolicies, such as restricting high risk individuals (such as felons and \nspouse abusers) from access to firearms, will reduce (but not eliminate) \nrates of violent crime.\n\nPlease note - I did all of that without calling you names.

I normally don't post on youtube channels. But all the \nbickering & insults pertaining to Elliot Roger and one's personal diagnosis \nof his mental conditions inspired me to reply. I will try to break this \ndown- Elliot Roger was an extreme form of narcissistic personality \ndisorder- which at its extremes over time taps into borderline personality \ndisorder. His narcissism spanned throughout his own life with extremities \nof emotions from incredible highs to incredible lows- and no in-between's. \nHis self-reflection and worth in the World was solely derived upon how \nother's would perceive him.  In most cases with extreme narcissism- \neverything going on around the subject is directed being done for, to or \nagainst them personally. The World completely revolves around their \npresence only.  Examples are pretty much validated throughout his saga of a \nmanifesto he left behind. When a couple was innocently out showing intimacy \nin a public venue- he immediately became volatile and enraged that they \ndoing this TO him. When his father made poor financial investments in his \ncareer- he was doing this TO him. When his mother failed to marry a wealthy \nbenefactor for HIS needs she was being selfish and doing this TO him.  If \nsomeone he was acquainted with had a sexual experience or simply garnered \nthe attention of a female this was being done TO and AGAINST him.  Even \nwhen his younger sibling starting growing taller in height & adapted better \nsocial skills early on- this was being done yet again- To & AGAINST him. A \ntrue narcissist feels subjected to all outside actions of other's around \nthem as a personally-directed relevance to their own individual gain or \ndemise when a healthy mind would never make that unrealistic connection. \n His grandiosity surged in a feeling of being \"owed\" everything- from \nwinning the lottery in all his failed attempts, having the girls he wanted \nand idealized as \"perfect mates\" beside other men, etc. He firmly believed \nit was all owed to him and if he did not substantiate by it or receive it \nthen the World itself was standing against him- hence his \nself-victimization by it.  He could not fit into any element of a normal \nsociety due to his distorted and over-absorptive self-importance.  He never \nworked a normal job in his life because anything out there he felt was \n\"beneath him\". He never kept or made healthy friendships in his adult life \nor had the attention of a girl because in his extreme narcissistic state he \njust expected to sit back and have it all come to him.

His \nself-reflection and worth in the World was solely derived upon how other's \nwould perceive him.  In most cases with extreme narcissism- everything \ngoing on around the subject is directed being done for, to or against them \npersonally. The World completely revolves around their presence only. \n Examples are pretty much validated throughout his saga of a manifesto he \nleft behind. When a couple was innocently out showing intimacy in a public \nvenue- he immediately became volatile and enraged that they doing this TO \nhim. When his father made poor financial investments in his career- he was \ndoing this TO him. When his mother failed to marry a wealthy benefactor for \nHIS needs she was being selfish and doing this TO him.  If someone he was \nacquainted with had a sexual experience or simply garnered the attention of \na female this was being done TO and AGAINST him.  Even when his younger \nsibling starting growing taller in height & adapted better social skills \nearly on- this was being done yet again- To & AGAINST him. A true \nnarcissist feels subjected to all outside actions of other's around them as \na personally-directed relevance to their own individual gain or demise when \na healthy mind would never make that unrealistic connection.  His \ngrandiosity surged in a feeling of being \"owed\" everything- from winning \nthe lottery in all his failed attempts, having the girls he wanted and \nidealized as \"perfect mates\" beside other men, etc. He firmly believed it \nwas all owed to him and if he did not substantiate by it or receive it then \nthe World itself was standing against him- hence his self-victimization by \nit.  He could not fit into any element of a normal society due to his \ndistorted and over-absorptive self-importance.  He never worked a normal \njob in his life because anything out there he felt was \"beneath him\". He \nnever kept or made healthy friendships in his adult life or had the \nattention of a girl because in his extreme narcissistic state he just \nexpected to sit back and have it all come to him.  All his attempts of \ngoing out and just sitting in a coffee shop or cafe he expected in his \ntempered self-entitlement and egocentricity would just grace him without \nneeding to put in any effort or objective for it himself. With the flawed \noutlook of \"Well, my magnificence is here, everyone will notice it & \ninevitably come to me\"  As was all his failed conquests & dreams in life- \nHe demanded it, expected it but had no clear understanding or desire in \nactually knowing how to work for it or earn it.   And for those that had it \n& what he wanted were the \"enemy\" and the perpetrators that were robbing it \nfrom him. This is all normal behaviors seen by someone with NPD. He was not \na bad looking guy, but when you have a botched outlook, a detached \npersonality and narcissistic \"everything is owed to me\" perspective it just \ndrives people away- so he sabotaged all his attempts of keeping or finding \ninterpersonal relationships in his life by his psychological ailment that \nfueled such distorted outlooks with other's around him.  Even when very \nattractive people come off as displaced, awkward or maladjusted it tends to \ndrive other's away from them and not toward them.  So as the older Elliot \nRoger became- the worse his narcissism grew in his self-regression fringing \ninto a borderline-personality disorder.  In BPD- this is where the impulse \ncontrols & coping mechanisms are completely lost.  This is where the \nemotional instability & already impaired self image really cracked.  And \nthis is exactly when he started lashing out by throwing his drinks on \nother's, having public tantrums in restaurants, and going as far as \nstalking & following strangers & attacking them with orange-juice filled \nwater-guns. This was the make or break point for him in his state of mental \nhealth.  If he was not to receive help at that critical point then that \n\"threshold\" even he talked about in his manifesto would be crossed & never \nreturned back from.  There are many behavioral patterns that were \ncompletely ignored. But that's pretty much his psychopathy in a \nchronological decline over the years. The warning signs were there early \non.
