My dad hasn't been a part of my life, \nreally ever, short of a few pairs of school shoes and my first CPU ( I got \nmy first CPU at 24 years old), and my mother is a recovering drug addict, \ncancer survivor, and lives in one bedroom with her boyfriend. \n\nI live with my GF, cannot find a job, and I do landscaping and construction \nwhen I can find work. Unfortunately, my field is now dominated by illegal \nimmigrants who will work 75 hr work weeks for 8$/hr. In comparison, when I \nwas 16, I was making 12$/hr for a 40-50 hr work week. Same jobs, same area, \nexcept now there are greater expectations for less pay. I even had a \ncompany tell me flat out \"Why would we hire white people? They want to go \nhome after 8 hrs (of HARD labor, we aren't talking air conditioned offices \nhere, we are talking 100 degree heat, or freezing cold). These Mexicans (or \nimmigrants from South America) will work for as long as we demand for \nminimum wage\"\n\nSo, I used to be a Liberal. Then I hit 25 and moved to a black \nneighborhood.

Under, \nor uneducated, and what we have left is regurgitated ignorance... over and \nover. How many people actually know their Constitutional rights? How many \npeople know the articles in the Bill of Rights? You'd be surprised how many \npeople just don't know, so the \"street\" version of ignorance takes over, \nand people believe it. For example, the right to bear arms was meant for \nnot only the protection of your person, your family; but yes... out \nforefathers KNEW that one day future leaders would be corrupt. Think about \nit.... America was founded upon the principal to defend against tyranny; \nforeign and DOMESTIC. You're talking about people who were well educated, \nand understood corruption, so they grabbed their intestinal fortitude and \nfought against it. Our leaders today are so corrupt, that even they \nthemselves break the very laws they passed.... take for example drugs, \nprostitution, perjury, and yes... MURDER. Most of what the Constitution \nonce stood for in this day and age is null and void. The people of the \nRevolutionary War had the balls to fight for the idea, or moreover the \nrepresentation of freedom, no taxation without representation, and no foot \nsoldiers storming our private homes. Homeland Gestapo/Security is able to \ndo that. Fear and submission used by King George is yet again in plain view \nwith the government of the United States that our Constitution once stood \nfor. Call me unpatriotic.... Patriotism is for the country and what it's \nsupposed to stand for... not blind loyalty to corruption, and bought and \npayed for corporately sponsored politicians who sold out their own people \nthrough The Patriot Act, and N.A.F.T.A. America's economy is pissed away, \nand some how corporations profit from it. The Patriot Act is passed, and \ndisregard, paranoia, and violence towards law enforcement erupts, thereby \ngiving the Feds the excuse they needed to bypass the people's \nConstitutional rights.

I was in Walter Reed Army \nHospital during the scandal back when Bushy Boy Jr. was supposedly leading \nthe country. There was an entire floor dedicated to victims of Agent \nOrange, and it wasn't a pretty picture. I certainly understand what you are \nsaying about the VA facilities, but what I can say is that just recently \nthere was a new facility built for out patients where I live. It's actually \nreally nice. The wait times are shorter, there's more available doctors and \npsychiatrists, and the med lines are pretty much maybe five minutes \ncompared to the 1 hour mark at the old facility. They do hope they start \ndoing that in more areas that need it. As for the private contractors, \ntheir business is war, and to make money. As a capitalist society, American \ncorporations will profit from such events. Remember, war brings an \nabundance of wealth, power, and yes.... death and destruction. That's what \nwar is. Believe me when I tell you, unless it dwells in the mind of an \ninsane person, killing another human being isn't gleeful, and it certainly \nisn't something a sane mind would justify, especially the killing of \ninnocent people. I refuse to believe in the comic book villain living in \ntheir underground layers rubbing their hands diabolically with smiles on \ntheir faces pondering the thought of how to screw things up. Most people \nact on violence because they believe that what they are doing is right, \nwhere the sane mind becomes insane. The radical Muslim groups, like \nAl-Queda for example, truly believe what they are doing is right, just as \nthe Catholics hundreds of years ago with the inquisition, and the Dark \nAges. If you've noticed throughout human history, which in the end is why \nsocieties, great empires and civilizations have fallen, the people in power \ndo believe in the one insane ruling principal, and that is that might makes \nright, until rebellion or war overturns that said group of people.

I was an asshole, but my \nmen were always taken care of, and they knew I would NEVER leave them to \nthe wolves, so to speak. You have to understand; I had every shit bag, 'ate \nup', pathological, soup sandwich, hypocritical NCO the Army could muster \nfor whatever reason by the chance of bad luck alone, and I swore to myself \nI would NEVER behave or turn into that kind of human being, and I didn't. I \nthink also those same shit bags forgot that \"Leaders lead from the \nfront..... Friendly fire comes from the rear\". Pathological leaders should \nremember that, if not simply for their own safety."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXjuwDneWUJcJ-SMkHhZXKA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ollie Phelan", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z122f51w0ty2xjceo23ez104zuqngdckh", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-28T12:16:25.720Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXjuwDneWUJcJ-SMkHhZXKA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.71875200000000006, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-28T12:16:25.720Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-y73tpiPlH50/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXI/gncCJOuxJgw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111952349493851812640", "textDisplay": "+The Rant\n\nWhat wouldve happened to those soldiers if you did go to your sargent  for \nhaving doubts about 911 ?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXjuwDneWUJcJ-SMkHhZXKA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ollie Phelan", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z122f51w0ty2xjceo23ez104zuqngdckh", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-28T12:10:19.925Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXjuwDneWUJcJ-SMkHhZXKA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.39704600000000001, "formal_score": 20, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-28T12:19:00.645Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-y73tpiPlH50/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXI/gncCJOuxJgw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111952349493851812640", "textDisplay": "+Alexandria Garnand\n\nDo you believe that ?\nOr do you just *not* want to believe the opposite .\n\nNot one soldier ?\nWell , theres plenty have appeared publicly to say the opposite .\n\nThe whole History of Vietnam from 1954 - 1974  shows the opposite .\n( 4 million dead  Viets / Free Fire Zones /  5 gallons of Chemicals  \nsprayed for every  *one*  Viet )\n\n2000  Iraqis were killed at US checkpoints in 2003 .\n63  were insurgents .\n\nThe RAF  said  (quote)  \"There are no more viable targets left to bomb in \nAfghanistan \"\nThey kept bombing though .\nIncluding SHEEP ,  Weddings , Fishing boats , and water towers .\n\nWhen they were asked  \"Why they were bombing sheep ?\"    the answer was   \n\"We reserve the right to defend ourselves\" .\n--------------------------------------\n\nAnd why would Exxon Mobil  want to criticise the Invasions and  *hostile*  \noccupations  that benefit  *only*  *THEM* ?\n---------------------------------------\n\n A Soldiers  *JOB* is  Death and Destruction.\nThats what theyre trained to do .\n\nHence the big machine guns .\nThey fire bullets , not  bags of rice to starving children ."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-vctIz-s-s5zabg492iaA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Alexandria Garnand", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z122f51w0ty2xjceo23ez104zuqngdckh", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-27T23:45:02.071Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc-vctIz-s-s5zabg492iaA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99999793039999996, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-27T23:45:02.071Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k_V80wSn1fQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAp3A/cNkT_mflsMI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103167870733733510332", "textDisplay": "Thank you."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yRizdd6KiarH9gLQ_XvKQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.18281535648994515, "authorDisplayName": "The Rant", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z122f51w0ty2xjceo23ez104zuqngdckh", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-27T23:34:19.082Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-yRizdd6KiarH9gLQ_XvKQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.03695200000000004, "formal_score": 15, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-27T23:34:19.082Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MdSl0EMCBtY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADw/mxxTlaQeAOw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101350463848637806800", "textDisplay": "+Alexandria Garnand No, your right.

Fahrenheit 911 set the record for highest grossing documentary of \nall time when it earned $230 million in theaters worldwide. Fahrenheit \neventually earned an additional $3 million from DVD sales. How much of that \nmoney goes into Michael Moore's pockets? Prior to the release of Fahrenheit \n911, Michael signed a deal with movie distributor which would entitle him \nto 27% of his film's net revenues.\nWith Fahrenheit, after the theaters took their standard 50% cut of box \noffice receipts, roughly $130 million in revenue was left over. When you \ntake away marketing, production and distribution expenses, Miramax and \nMoore were left with an estimated $80 million payday. Moore's 27% cut on \nthis film alone would eventually work out to roughly $21.6 million. He was \nactually entitled to 50% of the profits of Sicko which reportedly generated \nan additional $17 million payday for Michael. Moore is the author of eight \nbooks to date, several of which have gone on to be New York Time best \nsellers. Michael received a reported $1 million advance for \"Dude Where's \nMy Country\" plus a generous percentage of the book sales.  His net worth is \nestimated at $50 million.....Good for you Michael, another free market \ncapitalist success story!

I've watched \nthe documentaries, and I've moderately dug into the references, and I am \nsatisfied thus far that me is basically on the level. And while on this \nsite, I kept seeing this on the recommended videos, but hadn't watched it \nyet, because I like Michael Moore, and was a little afraid to see what this \nvideo might say. But then I decided that I needed to see all of the \nmaterial, good and bad, and make my own decision. After all, if there's \nevidence that will help me better understand someone, I should watch it. \nAnd if it says things I don't want to hear, but are true, then I'll change \nmy views and opinions.\n\nSo....here goes. I checked into the people shown in this video, and their \nbackgrounds, and if possible, what, in particular, they had to say. Also, I \nused my critical thinking to judge every little thing about this video, as \nI would with anything I watch (Michael Moore included). And I determined \nthat this video is horse_shit (my apologies to horses). This is clearly an \nattempt to bring down Michael Moore. It was made in such a way to try to \nfool his fans, in particular, into thinking this is actually legitimate and \nfair. In other words, it's meant to make people think \"they tried to give \nhim the benefit of the doubt, but the evidence just was against him....he's \na bad person\". But anyone with a well-functioning brain will see thru this \nin short order. \n\nSo if you're a Moore fan, definitely watch it, but it won't take long to \nsee what I'm talking about. This is very deceptive...using the same \ntechniques of propaganda that they accuse Moore of using. It is more clever \nin its deception than other videos I have seen, but nonetheless it is \nhorse_shit (sorry again, horses!).

You \nhave to ask yourself why would anybody be against human rights, due \nprocess, justice, health care, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? \nThe answer of course is it eliminates a class system where the wealthiest \none percent own 95 percent of all the wealth in the world.\n\nWhy do we tax income? - money that is EARNED and WORKED FOR up to 39 \npercent ? Yet we hardly tax money that WAS NOT EARNED and NOT WORKED FOR \nlike inheritance, trusts, gifts, interest income, dividends and all forms \nof capital gains? It's bad enough that the wealthy think they are entitled \nto FREE MONEY for the simple reason that they were ripped out of the right \ncrotch at birth, but to also demand that it all be tax free is outrageous \nand contemptible. We need to eliminate the deduction on inheritance and tax \nall WELFARE inheritance at 50 percent. And I don't buy the double taxation \nargument as federal employees are the only ones truly taxed twice yet I \ndon't see any support for allowing them to pay no taxes. It is income for \nthe person receiving it and they did nothing to earn it so they should be \nhappy to pay taxes on it.\n\nWe need to take the contribution cap off social security so the wealthy pay \ntheir fair share. It would also save social security for the next 500 years.\n\nWe have spent over 100 years offering incentives and tax breaks to \nbusinesses that have used them to automate factories and put people out of \nwork. The Bush tax cuts resulted in businesses closing plants in America \nand moving jobs overseas. Well it's time to stop using the CARROT and start \nusing the STICK. We need to severely PUNISH businesses who automate and \nmove jobs overseas. We need some massive disincentives for bad behavior. \nTax cuts should only go to employers who can prove that they created good \njobs and should be tied directly to how many good high paying permanent \njobs they create. The STICK is the answer to whip these traitors into \nacting like patriotic leaders.\n\nThe SCOTUS has declared Corporations are \"people\". It only follows that we \nneed SCOTUS suits involving factory automation (robots) that replaced human \nemployees being ruled as \"people\" too and each robot subject to paying \ntaxes, medicare, social security and having to apply for citizenship.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13tettjlomtyrrue22jg5lodsepshyyf04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjEzvsDlIv9DeFlZWd3mqQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hqJ-NJeZflE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACU/gMQIJhhwfuw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Michael Gunderson", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-11T01:42:32.141Z", "videoId": "DIY_kktWJlg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOjEzvsDlIv9DeFlZWd3mqQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.83879819999999994, "formal_score": 65, "updatedAt": "2015-03-11T01:42:32.141Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100364054930983768744", "textDisplay": "That's the best way to sum Michael Moore up.

Indian death toll under the British rule a Non communist Govt.\nThese stats are hidden to a large extent to the Anglo eyes because presents \na questionable motiff when pointing fingers at other regimes (murderous as \nthey maybe)\n\n2) 1776 to present - 1,321,612 including 618,222  from the American civil \nwar. Not sure what the exact stats are though if you take into account the \nnumerous tribes that were wiped out to form the American union.

These deaths are \ntaken into account along with the un-represented figures during the \ncolonization of the African Continent carried out by imperialistic nations \nlooking to further their territorial expanse.\n\nNon-Communist Govts\n\n4) Russian Civil War death toll pre Stalin era (1917-22): 9,000,000 deaths\n\nNon-Communist Govt\n\n5) Total death toll contributed by Anglo-American Allies during world war 2 \n( yes it was started by a fascist Germany, i'll give you that) . But the \nreasons why both the world wars were started are muddled up and believers \nwill believe what they want. Several historians have been shut out because \ntheir writings based on facts that were not in line with the conventional \nbeliefs that were forced on people. You know the - 'History will be written \nby Victors' thing. I urge you to research and  think and make comparisons \non what were the salient parameters for the outbreak of both the world wars \nand the Iraq wars.\n\n\nBombing of Germany:\n\n499,750\n\nBombing of Japan:\n\nConventional bombing:\n260,000 \n\nNuclear bombing:\n175,000 outright, 140,000 later\n\nAnd a lot more (i was getting late and i had to drop the research here)\n\nYes you can argue that # 5 cites deaths that are collateral in war - a \nreason. \n\nNothing was or is as media portrays it as (this goes both ways) \nThere were lines to acquire rationed consumables, but that was during times \nof need and not always as otherwise portrayed. \n\nDemocratic or non-communist countries have made their citizens believe in \nthe false freedoms that we think we enjoy( trust me i know, I am from \nIndia, the so called largest democratic country in the world population \nwise) The freedoms that we think we have, have elevated our levels of \ndesire to such an extent that we do not have a limit of what we want or how \nwe choose to get what we want. This often, actually always leads to \nsomeones line of respect and dignity being violated, if you know what i \nmean.\n\nIf you do an introspection of yourself and the country you live in, you \nthink you have it all, but do you really know how much you loose at the end \nof the day by way of taxes paid to the govt that we never see again? Th US \nis known to have the worst health care in the world closely followed by \nIndia. This is not the case in socialist countries.\n\nToday's communist giant, China has progressed far beyond what you and i can \nfathom. The US owes China somewhere in the region of 1.4 trillion ( not \nbillion, not million) in debt. China practically owns a certain percentage \nof the US.\n\nYes communist countries have had murderous beginnings, but taking China as \nan example, (i am not going to say its worth it, nothing is worth anything \nover a human life) you see where communism can get you.\n\nThe beginnings of almost every democratic or non-communist country was by \nthe same savagery and brutal nature, as is suggested by easily available \nstats on the web\n\nThe story that you own nothing in communist / socialistic countries is a \nmyth. You will need to travel to these countries to take a look for your \nself. The per capita income of these countries is far higher than what you \ncan even begin to imagine. Do not take my words as fact, travel to these \nplaces and take a look for yourself.\n\nYes i agree there are failed communist states, just like failed democratic \nor non-communist countries."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFMVaAY6i0ovM8NLPHYSxg", "inappropriate_score": 0.2484472049689441, "authorDisplayName": "Houdini", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12yc1aqawjocpm1022edxfr4te0crn5m04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-29T01:31:53.600Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeFMVaAY6i0ovM8NLPHYSxg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29724200000000001, "formal_score": 38, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-29T01:33:33.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IXnXYZwhopA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADU/GrrIBkUnJEQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100551826118748114987", "textDisplay": "+Saveen Sadanand\nHow long do you got?

My father \nworked hard, learned various trades, Mastered a couple trades, then took \nthat knowledge, along with the money he had saved, and now runs a \nsuccessful business. He has money, but it's not mine. I have had too work \nfor every single thing I have. I had my grandfathers 1981 F100 as my first \ntruck, I followed in my fathers footsteps. I now drive a 2008 Laramie Mega \ncab, have a 2013 F450, 3 different trailers, and I operate a hotshot \ncompany. I started at Food Giant when I was 15 yrs old, I learned trades, \nbecause there will always be a demand for them. Working hard and making \nsure your name is associated with said work, will absolutely give you \nplenty of opportunity. It takes 6 years too become a Master Electrician, \nand it isn't some simple trade, I know plenty of \"university\" students that \ncan't make heads or tails of some of the formulas we use in the field, let \nalone could they do the actual physical labor. I got my Journeyman to fall \nback on, he has a Masters to fall back on, not too mention my other \ncertifications in the EMS field. Don't blindly assume that people are \nstupid that didn't attend college, that pisses me off, even more so because \nof how many mistakes I have seen \"University\" Electrical Engineers make on \nsets of Engineered plans. Every single electrician I know can calcuate and \ncorrect those errors on a piece of plywood sitting on top of some saw \nhorses in the field. Also, we broke away from the crown for a reason, the \nlast the we care to do is emulate any country in Europe, we fought to be \nthe oppposite for a reason. There is no such thing as equality in a \nsocialism either, you have way more of a chance in a a true capitalist \nsociety, we have become a shitty corporate structure though, which is not \ncapitalist, I'm sick of that being confused. One other thing, every year \nmore prisons are becoming privately owned, with stock in the market, that's \npart of this shitty corporate structure we are in, even so, no one goes to \nprison for Jay walking, most prisoners are actually non violent drug \noffenders, most of whom I can agree should be released. However, when a \nbunch of greedy assholes start infiltrating a government, then turn it into \na damn business, that's what you get. So don't confuse corporatism with \ncapitalism, the US was built by Capitalism and is being destroyed by \nCorporatism, but just as we broke from from that shit crown, the American \npeople will eventually prevail over this horse shit.

It was \"The Awful \nTruth\", being aired on Australia's \"Special Broadcasting Service\" (SBS).  \nComing from a country where \"stunt politics\" were often coming from \ngenuinely good politicians (yes, we actually do have a few left in our \nnation), particularly those who ran as 3rd parties or independents, I had \nno problem with the type of \"stunt pseudo-politics\" that he used in his \nshow.  In fact, I was an avid fan.\n\nOver time it became apparent that rather than letting the facts and \nevidence speak for themselves, that his work was littered with examples of \nmisrepresentations and edit-room manipulations that ensured that his films \nwould conform to his preconceived notion of how the finished product should \nall play out.\n\nHe may be a great filmmaker (and again, I have no problems with stunts, per \nse), but Michael Moore certainly has issues with journalistic integrity.  \nTo truth-seekers everywhere, this should be a huge red-flag.\n\nIs it a matter of ego?  Controlled opposition? - These are things I don't \nhave an answer for.  Still, those who support him and his work \nunquestioningly are doing themselves and their fellow citizens a great \ndisservice.\n\nOne can respect a person for bringing certain issues to light...but that \ndoes not mean their work or journalistic integrity is beyond reproach...and \nMichael Moore certainly fits that category.\n\nNow more than ever, truth-seekers need to be aware of deceptions coming \nfrom people who claim to be on their side.  If one aligns themselves with \nsomeone who is later shown to be deceptive, it will ultimately be highly \ndetrimental to the cause of truth-seekers everywhere.\n\nI'm not here to spark a political debate or further polarize Michael \nMoore...but there are certain realities we must all face: The man we \nthought was bringing us \"The (whole) Awful Truth\", has not been...and to \nbury our heads in the sand because we once supported his work is not the \nway that genuine truth-seekers should operate.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13jtnea2vqwu3lsd23httegoqf4hhfq004": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDIWCWVECZ1XQadQAmHIkNg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2a3h1n5Lvyo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACk/OZf4Yhf-Gjk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tippersnore", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-03T01:11:32.581Z", "videoId": "DIY_kktWJlg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDIWCWVECZ1XQadQAmHIkNg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.33017800000000003, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-11-03T01:11:32.581Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101086267643997700125", "textDisplay": "Documentaries are novels based on some selection of facts.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13kevdrhsaqdzft523cuzfajovvjpsyr04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKTsy2UYYrEi0A04pasl4iQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Voice of Reason", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-03T11:57:07.228Z", "videoId": "DIY_kktWJlg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKTsy2UYYrEi0A04pasl4iQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.97393639999999992, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-03T11:57:07.228Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115420400077044487616", "textDisplay": "Thank you so very much for opening my eyes! \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12yxbyymvmyu5dz104cglco3zmfgtrgsfc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWxiN8qLiJEEO1k4o2FifLw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ID4xQYLQwLc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/CqwTI0vVTbw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.8867924528301887, "authorDisplayName": "Michael Stead", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-17T18:40:39.322Z", "videoId": "DIY_kktWJlg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCWxiN8qLiJEEO1k4o2FifLw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.76979200000000003, "formal_score": 18, "updatedAt": "2014-08-17T18:42:41.000Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117606384702336825173", "textDisplay": "What a piece of shit - The work of the extremely ignorant for the even more \nignorant - cause ending the war in Iraq is bad - Please kill yourselves.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z133hhloizvkfrezi04cgntg0rj5sxxgin00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxiVUsp6mMx70y4mNc7WqZw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.1560693641618498, "authorDisplayName": "scott kosterow", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-13T14:41:47.124Z", "videoId": "DIY_kktWJlg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxiVUsp6mMx70y4mNc7WqZw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.89470850000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-06-13T14:41:47.124Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104858106092081542087", "textDisplay": "this is BS!

It's okay for George Bush Jr. \nto abuse cocaine, pass unconstitutional, totalitarian laws like the very \nunpatriotic Patriot Act, and the start of Homeland Security/Gestapo, and \nallowing the NSA to spy on every phone call and internet site we visit, and \nto lie to the public about Cloud, which is nothing more than another way to \nmonitor us. It's okay for most members of the Federal Government to use \nillicit drugs, but not private citizens. It's okay for the Federal \nGovernment to lie, cheat and steal from American citizens. Isn't that a \nform of terrorism in itself? The decimation of our economy, and removing \nbasic rights of the citizens in this country isn't an act of terrorism from \nour own leaders? Where is the Supreme Court to defend us? They have the \npower to, but they do nothing, and you honestly believe the best course of \naction is the armament of corrupt law officers, and the disarmament of the \nprivate citizens so they can't defend themselves against tyranny? It \ndoesn't make much sense to disarm private citizens if terrorists are really \nlurking behind every corner like our leaders claim, does it? I'd say I was \nconfused by our leaders line of reasoning, if it wasn't obvious what they \nare attempting already, and if you have to ask after decades of deceit and \nand a government that tells us \"Do as we say, not as we do.\".... well... \nthere's only so much stupidity in this country people with a brain can \nstand.Do you want to know who the real terrorists are in this country, \naccording to our leaders with self proclaimed godhoodism; it you, it's me, \nand every free citizen in this country, according to The Patriot Act. All \nof us have the potential to be terrorists, because god forbid if we call \nthe Federal Government out like Snowden. It's because of him that we even \nknow what our filthy politicians are doing, and what was their response? \nFuck you citizens if you know or don't know, we want Snowdens head on a \nplatter. How dare he betray the Gods on Mount Olympus? You do realize that \nour Republican leaders have been using religion to justify their causes \noverseas, don't you? You do realize they are nothing more than Modern Day \nPharisees, don't you? To be Christ-like, or to behave like people who \nkilled Christ, and unfortunately, most people who don the cross around \ntheir necks and claim to walk in the footsteps of Christ are the biggest \nhypocrites of them all. Liars, hatred, separation, and blood shed isn't \nwalking in the footsteps of Christ, is it? Or did I miss something?????"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-vctIz-s-s5zabg492iaA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Alexandria Garnand", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xjh4wize1yxwpo04cfv14ekeniterly00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-29T00:32:35.497Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc-vctIz-s-s5zabg492iaA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.59262999999999999, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-29T00:32:35.497Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-k_V80wSn1fQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAp3A/cNkT_mflsMI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103167870733733510332", "textDisplay": "Your preaching to the choir!

He has called \nthe pro-life side \"uterus police...who hate women\" and \"creepy...wanting to \nbe the bossypants of everyone else's reproductive parts\", pushing the \nradical feminist canard that \"antichoice\" Republicans just resent women's \n\"sexual freedom\".  As with Bart Stupak- he threatened to vote against the \nACA over \"abortion funding\", and yes it wasnt in the bill so Stupak was \nwrong but Moore led the ultra-liberal base in recruiting his friend Connie \nSaltonstall & threatening to primary him for D-MI 1st district, along with \nKeith Olbermann and Feministing .com ...then went on DemocracyNow! to bash \nthe moderate Hyde Amendment, supported by Obama and 75% of the country as \n\"societal discrimination against women\" and demand federal funding for \nabortion, not for the first time. Back in 2000 when stumping for \nNader-LaDuke he thundered from the podium that Bill Clinton, a perfectly \nstraightforward prochoice Democrat had \"not done enough\" to protect access \nto abortion- when he had vetoed a popular partial-birth(D&X) ban, pushed \nthrough the FACE law federally banning blockades at clinics and ramped up \nFBI action against the terrorist/violent fringe of pro-lifers. What else is \na president supposed to do? You see- difference between just saying \n\"RoevWade should remain as law\" or \"trust women to make their own \ndecisions\" like most people I know on that side and being a \n\"culture-warrior\"\n\nParental rights- you know what he was up to in the 70s except for \nsupporting Sandinistas, Jesse Jackson, homosexuals, LSD addled new age \nfalse religion and the Mary Calderone/ Joseph Fletcher \"called to \nresponsible freedom\" sex peddlers in Flint Voice? Running the Davison \nHotline youth center, which took Catholic Church funds to \"help teenagers \nat risk\" but actually told them how they could sue schools into dropping \ndress codes or other rules, had a library of dirty textbooks, provided \nexplicit sex education, contraceptives, values clarification (i.e. \"develop \nyour own morals\" with no absolutes!), referrals for drug treatment, VD and \nErhard seminars & \"facilitated personal growth groups\" (i.e. sensitivity \ntraining encounter groups, kids encouraged to \"self-express\" in filthy \namoral ways, share secrets and touch each other in the dark. Of course it \nbegan in California...land of fruits and nuts). And parents were **NOT EVEN \nINFORMED** the kids has attended the center, let alone what for! That's \nextremism all right!\nThat is what the scene in this film means where you see \"we shall stay \nfree\" outside the Lapeer Road house. Pro family parents, churches and \nbusinessmen tried to shut the radical thing down and they saw that as an \naffront to their rights. What about parents' and responsible citizens' \nrights?\n\nEven in 2008 he used Bristol Palin's unfortunate situation to bash \nabstinence and complain the Supreme Court were not hard enough on parents, \nsaying it was \"child abuse\" to expect pregnant minors to let their mom know \nthat before ending the pregnancy. So- not better with age I suppose.\n\nI have evidence as far as the specific \"religious/political extremist\" \ncharge too.- no offence intended, as I say he has done good work but many \nwho appreciate his films are unaware he is way out there on \"social issues\"."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJw9MnCsO-nNo1NxV4I2WDQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.26666666666666666, "authorDisplayName": "Antonia Schlitt", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z121yzk5vumit5kdy23rd51yumq5uf0vr", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-08T12:40:42.988Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJw9MnCsO-nNo1NxV4I2WDQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.36656399999999995, "formal_score": 23, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-07-08T12:40:42.988Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NKmVM3M3iso/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/RxD3tIUhJMs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101658726818263504886", "textDisplay": "+Jonathan Kuperberg a german singer, named xavier naidoo, onds said, that \nhe still is a member of the catholic church, because this gives himself a \nright to speak up against them, not because he thinks atheists don 't have \nthe right to do so, but because if you are a member they will listen to \nyou. \nPro-abortion is not a militant thing, it's an opinion, he thinks that wlmen \nshould have the right to devide about what happens with their body and tgat \nwomen should have the right to decide if they are capable of the \nresponsibility.
