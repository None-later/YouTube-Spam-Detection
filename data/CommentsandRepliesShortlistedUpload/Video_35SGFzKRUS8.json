P. Purington Lets debunk this impersonating an office charge once and \nfor all: According to Mark Lane, everything Vince Bugliosi says of him is \nfalse. From being called a \"fraud\" to the most egregious\u2013Bugliosi's false \nclaim that Lane misrepresented himself as a police officer to get an \ninterview with an important witness. That last issue is easily debunked by \nLane since there is in existence, the original recording which was given to \nthe Warren Commission in 1964. In the recording Lane clearly does not \nrepresent Capt. Fitz and only identifies himself in questioning Helen \nMarkham's witnessing of the murder of Dallas police officer J. D. Tippet.\n\nBugliosi's criticisms of Lane, besides being apparently erroneous, are also \nslanderous as impersonating a police office is a crime. But, it won't be \nthe first time Bugliosi slandered someone. He was sued for slander by \nHerbert H. Weisel, his milkman, in the early 1970's and settled the case by \nagreeing to a $12,500 payment.\n\nMark Lane answered a question I have long wondered--why didn't he sue \nBugliosi for character assassination? Lane's answer is that he didn't want \nto bring any greater publicity to Bugliosi and his book that flopped in the \nmarketplace. I can understand that but winning a suit could also make a \npublic disgrace of Bugliosi's faulty research and show who the real fraud \nis.\n\nOn the other hand, Lane has sent fair warning of a lawsuit to Tom Hanks and \nthe producers are working with Bugliosi on a 10-part TV series for HBO to \nbe broadcast for the 50th anniversary in 2013 should Bugliosi repeat his \nattacks on Lane for that show."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7BvGa1oF9s4s9ZaOs5TeQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "D.

Are those people in very high positions ?\nA.  Yes\n\nSo the assertion that Ruby loved Kennedy and wanted to spare Jackie from \ntestifying at trial against Oswald is so much bull.\n\nEvery Parklands doctor and surgeon said there was large gaping evulsed \n(exit) wound at the right-rear of JFK's head.   Oswald certainly didn't \nfire that shot as it was impossible to create that wound from the southeast \ncorner of the TSBD.  \n\nWhat valid reason was there for basically snatching the body from Parkland \nhospital and transporting it to Bethesda hospital in Maryland for the \nautopsy to be conducted by a Dr. Humes who had never done an autopsy in his \nlife and supervised by an Admiral?    An Admiral?!!?    By law the autopsy \nshould have been performed in Dallas.   One has to conclude that in the \nhands of the military the autopsy could be controlled and the conclusions \ncontrolled.\nThe X rays are fake - why?  because they don't even make sense compared to \nthe faked autopsy photos!    Some of the Parklands doctors present on \n11/22/63  that have been shown them have stated so.   The X rays purport to \nshow damage to the front of JFK's head.   The autopsy photos show no such \ndamage. \n\nThe Zapruder film also shows signs of alteration.  The biggest 'goof ' of \nall in the film is the cut-out appearance of the lamp post (watch it frame \nby frame) which indicates that it's part of the lower half of a re-timed \ncomposite with the aim of hiding the fact that the limo stopped or very \nnearly stopped.  They knew the film would eventually been seen by the \npublic and the limo stopping would be just too suspicious.\ufeff\n\nFrazier who gave Oswald a ride in to work on that day has always maintained \nthat the package that Oswald was carrying was too small to accommodate a \ndisassembled Carcanno rifle.   Even if it had been a disassembled rifle, \nthe rifle would need to be 'zeroed in' again following reassembly which was \nnot practically possible.\nOn examination, the FBI concluded that the scope of the Carcanno rifle was \nmisaligned and had to be adjusted to make it accurate.   \n\nNew evidence has just emerged of Mrs. GERALDINE REID, a TSBD employee who \nconfirms she was giving Oswald change for a dollar (for the Coke machine) \nat the very moment they heard the shots.  It caused them to give each other \na look.  She was threatened while alive, but allowed her story to be \nreleased upon her death.    There was another Reid, Mrs. Robert (Delores) \nReid, but this was a different woman, not to be confused, even though the \n'lone-nutters' will tell you that you're mistaken and it was her.   \n Carolyn Arnold, V.P. of the TSBD, corroborates Reid's account, as she \nstates the Commission changed her testimony and she was with Oswald in the \nbreak room at 12:25 by the water cooler.  This, once and for all, destroys \nthe argument that Oswald did it and proves the Warren Commission and Warren \nReport were a total cover-up and lie.\nIn the 14 years following the JFK assassination there were 70 suspicious \nunnatural deaths among witnesses.   The probability of this happening by \nchance is -\n1 in  714,705,498,316,173,300,000,000,000,000,000   That number is greater \nthan the number of grains of sand on Earth.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13xjrfqxweotfsap04cjl3ictv5hxogu4s": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ9zsSrSF55WZD6ftqUX6IQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "David Jakstys", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-20T01:50:35.965Z", "videoId": "35SGFzKRUS8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZ9zsSrSF55WZD6ftqUX6IQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.72449600000000003, "formal_score": 90, "updatedAt": "2014-11-20T01:50:35.965Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117582368244681421827", "textDisplay": "I kept listening to these conspiracy guys.

They were the \nclosest thing to Royalty in America. ( I believe it was common to date \neach-other in the Post WWII area.) \nLBJ -----  was a Shady President and he knew how to control the press and \ncongress. The only good thing he did during his Presidency was to enforce \nthe Civil Rights to all Americans. LBJ was a lot worse than Nixon ever-was \nand the only thing that saved him being vilified in American History is the \nCivil Rights. \n1) Your right -- LBJ had as lot of MOB connections and a lot of supposed \ngangsters did work for him. But I don't think he would have appointed any \ncriminal element to lead the investigation on the Warren Commission.The \npalm print on the box was due to incompetency. If Malcolm Wallace's palm \nprint was on the box at the crows nest where Lee Harvey Oswald was and he \nreally had something to do with the assassination, the evidence would be \nnon-existent.\n2)   Gerry Patrick Hemming he was a mercenary which wasn't proven he was a \ntrue mercenary. He may have tried to work for the MOB and called himself a \nmercenary. He claims that Texas oil men offered money to him for the \nassassination of JFK? I am not sue --- but -- THINK-- this guy was in \nPrison claiming this to get a reduced sentence is that correct?\n3) I was reading something on Lee Harvey Oswald's cell mate claiming he \nconfessed something to him that he Shot JFK. -- That's only hear-say. There \nis no facts to back either of their stories up! In an investigation its \nputting together a puzzle of facts.\n****** Here's what I think but all I have -- only what I read in the past \nand I don't have all my facts on the table to make any kind of \ndetermination of what really happened. There have been many theories, books \nand movies written about the Kennedy Assassination. \nSo I welcome any corrections, new facts or any insight on what happened on \nNovember 22, 1963.\n A) Lee Harvey Oswald -- acted along because be he was ambitious and wanted \nto make a name for himself but he had no skill.\n B) He defected to Russia --- WHY? -- The Russians didn't want him at first \nand he attempted suicide. He had knowledge of the radar systems when he was \nin the Marines. That was outdated classified material from 1960. The \nRussians already knew the radar equipment to track U2 spy plains from other \nspies. They only needed Lee Harvey Oswald to verify what they already knew. \nThat's why they only gave him a year work permit. He spoke Russian well and \nfooled people thinking that he was born there. \n C) He had a dishonorable discharge from the Marines. \n D) He took a shot at General Walker and missed because he wanted to make a \nname for himself. Don't you think if he had the chance he would have done \nit to Kennedy? \n F) He was 24 years old when he shot the President with not much skill you \nthink LBJ, CIA or some Texas Oil Barron would take a chance on Oswald to \nincriminate themselves? That would be a big chance don't you think?\n G) If Oswald was a patsy why would they send Jack Ruby to assassinate Lee \nHarvey Oswald? Why not kill him in the Dallas Police Station and Claiming \nit was suicide? Jack Ruby died of Cancer in 1967. If LBJ, MOB, CIA or \nCastro had him kill Oswald it would take a greater chance to self \nincriminate themselves. \nI think there is a lot of coincidences that my look like there was a \nconspiracy. If there was why would anyone order something done in \nbroad-daylight and in-front of National Television for the whole world to \nsee?  That's a big risk for anyone to pull-off. To assassinate the most \npowerful person in the world granted a lot of people profited on his death. \nThere is intelligent crimes committed world wide and even in our own \ncountry. Criminologist usually catches the criminals. I was reading about a \nperson committed a crimes from 1959 he was prosecuted last year. \n Well 2020 The Warren Commissions findings about the Kennedy's \nAssassination will be available to the public. I think than the new \nfindings will prove my theory about the incompetency of the way the \ninvestigation was handled.  \n   Does anyone have anything to add? I could be wrong and we are in a free \ncountry all open for debate.     \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z130engj2o3xfznjx04cfpjpzyf2c1t4duw0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4_6_wmKaPgn_mMpe4qMsrg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "plums61", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2013-12-29T00:22:38.802Z", "videoId": "35SGFzKRUS8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4_6_wmKaPgn_mMpe4qMsrg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.57375200000000004, "formal_score": 75, "updatedAt": "2013-12-29T00:22:38.802Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102798144974275809826", "textDisplay": "to believe the warren commision report is to believe the magic bullet \n theory, need i say more!!!!!!!!!!!! oh and by the way the senate house \ncommitee started an investigation in 1976 and in 1978 published its \nfindings and i quote \" Kennedy was very likely assassinated as a result of \na conspiracy.

I simply don't believe it, from what \nwe know of Oswald. I don't believe such a creature was an FBI or CIA agent. \nSome people insist there are secret documents buried in the National \nArchives that will be released some day and prove he was a CIA guy. When \nthose documents are released, I'll believe it. Until then, in the absence \nof any evidence, I'll have to use my own judgement.\n\nBut let's grant for argument's sake that he WAS a CIA agent. That doesn't \nnecessarily mean the CIA was behind this particular assassination, and I'll \ngive you a for instance in history why I say this.\n\nIn 1934, King Alexander of Yugoslavia was assassinated in Marseille by \nVlado Czernozemski.Czernozemski was a ruthless professional killer and \nassassin. Possibly no man in history has ever been tied up with so many \npolitical conspiracies, in an area of the world (the Balkans) absolutely \nrife with conspiracies. Czernozemski was part of an earlier assassination \nconspiracy against Alexander which involved Bulgarian & Macedonian secret \norganizations and the Croatian Ustasi, about as grand a parlay of \nconspiracy groups as one can imagine This particular assassination attempt \nfizzled and the conspiracy broke up and scattered, but Czernozemski was \nstill absolutely determined to kill the King, which he eventually succeeded \nin doing. Though he was involved in an earlier conspiracy, in the attempt \nthat succeeded, he was actually acting alone (it is believed).\n\nSo just because Oswald may have been a CIA or FBI or a Pro or Anti Castro \nactivist, or a Mafia hit man, doesn't necessarily mean that IN THIS CASE he \ndidn't act alone. What I'm trying to say is that even seemingly damning \ncircumstances don't necessarily lead to an obvious conclusion. Or, in other \nwords, none of us really knows what happened. We might have ideas and \ntheories and think they are logical conclusions from a string of facts, but \neven logical conclusions aren't necessarily 100% correct. It is logical to \nassume that if Oswald was a CIA agent, the CIA was involved in the \nassassination\u2014but it ain't necessarily so."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNmUfGvWUgtkKydVl81h4eA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "marco calarco", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13zejqhzvi5wp2on04cflaa2vy0vtshnqc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-08T02:38:32.637Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNmUfGvWUgtkKydVl81h4eA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.87271239999999994, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-08T02:38:32.637Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uoMKkzOg57s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE8/AZTHH3pCluE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117794038107967247881", "textDisplay": "+RRaquello And there's no good evidence LHO did it.

I \nwasn't referring as much to the notion that the JFK conspiracy was an \ninside job or about how many people would've been involved in planning the \nactions leading to the point of motivating a person into taking the action \nof assassination regardless, but rather in a more general sense of what \nsort of \"conspiracy theories\" float around and that we actually know of. \nConspiracies like overthrowing foreign governments to plant leaders that \nare for your cause.\n\nPerhaps I ought to have used \"chemtrails\" as an example of scale that would \ninvolve more than just parties with personal interest, but watergate was \nactually realistic and has been uncovered exactly because someone wasn't \ncommitted enough to keep their mouth shut.\n\nTruly, many a scheme can be compartmentalized in such a covert way that the \npeople indirectly involved don't even realize that they're working towards \na larger conspiracy. Even if such people were found, or blew the whistle, \nthey wouldn't have any idea of the true motivations and likely have little \nevidence either. Considering how it took Snowden quite some effort to amass \nthe evidence he had, it's clear that some secrets are well kept and that \neven ordinary people can be weened into believing that what they're doing \nis right, no doubt about that.\n\nIt's not that I wouldn't be open to evidence, but evidence is the key, mere \npostulating may just as well misdirect as it may lead to the right \ndirection; It may still well be that Oswald was deliberately lead to taking \nthe action and that anything and everything done to paint him as the sole \nperpetrator was but a coverup, but it may also be that the likes of alien \nabductions are all but smoke and mirrors for something bigger as well, but \nthere are still those who are convinced that we're being visited by \nextraterrestrials.\n\nThere's really no telling what is set up by the government to mislead those \ninvolved or interested and without a shared personal agenda, willing to \nblow a whistle the moment they see something.

There \nis no doubt that the mafia hated the Kennedy brothers (not without reason), \nbut there is also no hard evidence that the mob in fact was involved. Both \nOswald and Ruby were far too unreliable and unstable to be entrusted with \nsuch an important assignment. We know that Oswald tried and failed to \ncommit one murder (Walker) and later successfully murdered Tippitt. We know \nthat he was an unhappy man with delusions of grandeur. And it's close to \ncertain that we'll never know more about the assassination than we know \ntoday.\n\nThat the Warren report was incomplete and inaccurate in certain particulars \ngoes without saying. LBJ should have given the commission all the time it \nneeded to issue a report, but due to geopolitical exigencies he felt the \nneed to have its findings ASAP to forestall public outrage against Cuba and \nUSSR. \n\nThere was a conspiracy however -- but it took place after the fact. Perhaps \nthe greatest travesty was committed by the Secret Service, which absconded \nwith the president's body, forcibly (and illegally) removing the corpse \nfrom Parkland and taking it to Bethesda Naval. What ensued was a true \ncomedy of errors. Had JFK's body remained at Parkland, where experienced \nforensic examiners could have precisely tracked the bullet wounds of the \npresident and Gov. Connally, much of the confusion that lingers to this day \nwould have been averted. Instead a rushed and woefully inaccurate autopsy \nwas performed by career officers who lacked the requisite expertise for the \njob. \n\nThe Kennedy family too bears much of the responsibility for the present \nconfusion. To this very day researchers must obtain permission from the \nfamily to access certain evidence that should have been public all along. \nNo doubt Bobby wanted to suppress evidence of the ongoing plot to kill \nCastro, not to mention the attempt to recruit the mob; revealing this \nevidence would've proved embarrassing. But the suppression of this evidence \n(and much else) has only stoked the conspiratorial fires.\n\nWe are pattern-seeking animals. There is more than enough anecdotal \nevidence to sustain a dozen theories of this tragic crime. But that doesn't \nmake them true. Indeed, the existence of so many theories (many of them \nmutually contradictory) should tell us that they can't all be true, that \nmost of them don't withstand scrutiny and ultimately none of them do.\n\nIt's deeply unsatisfying to think that a great man could be killed by a \nmalcontent, a loser. Yet history shows that assassinations have been \ncommitted by exactly such a man. Lincoln was killed by a racist actor; he \nindeed had co-conspirators but they ultimately failed or refused to \nparticipate. Garfield was shot by an unstable, disaffected office-seeker \nwhose family was marked by mental illness. (If not for utterly incompetent \nmedical care, Garfield would've lived.) McKinley was killed by an anarchist \nwho also suffered mental illness.

You're in dreamland little camper.  We will never know \nexactly who whacked JFK. No one has ever been convicted of it, and no one \never will be. But you can believe whatever you wish, free country and all. \nlol..\n\nIt's obvious you don't know the real side of the Kennedy's.  Mainly Papa \nJoe, JFK, RFK and Teddy.  So let's educate you shall we?\n\nLet's be honest here!  JFK was a hypocrite that thought Daddy's stolen \nmoney made him untouchable. Well, he got touched.\n \nPapa Joe:  Joe Kennedy was a Mafia connected Bootlegger, and one of the \nmanipulators of the 1929 stock market crash! That prick should have gone to \nprison!  He stole $millions from hard working people! \nThe family knew where all of that money came from as they grew older. They \nall went to the best colleges and had the best life styles with the money \nPapa Joe stole from hard working people that lost everything.. \nPapa Joe also rigged the 1960 election for JFK.  It's no secret that Papa \nJoe had Sam Giancana \"through Sinatra\" swing the vote in ILL. and TX., in \nexchange for JFK and RFK to back off of the Mafia.   JFK and RFK knew about \nthis too.  That's voter fraud for your beloved and honest JFK!  Papa Joe \nhad the press on his payroll also.  They would print anything he asked \nfor!  JFK and RFK knew about all of it!  How could they not? lol.. \n\nJFK:  JFK was a snake, just like his Father.\nHow come JFK didn\u2019t allow Sammy Davis Jr. to come to his inaugural party?  \nSammy campaigned for him too!   I wonder why JFK didn\u2019t invite Sammy? lol.  \nI also wonder why JFK voted against the 1957 Civil Rights act. What a \nmystery. lol ..  Vietnam:  Tell me?  Why under JFK was military personnel \nincreased in Vietnam from 900 (under IKE), to 16,000 under JFK?  JFK even \nsent helicopters there.  So much for not wanting war in Vietnam! lol.  The \nBay of Pigs: This was a total disaster caused by JFK himself!  Not the \nCIA!  JFK changed the original Bay of Pigs plan that IKE signed off on.  \nHad the Bay of Pigs original plan been left in place, Castro would have \nbeen eliminated!  Therefore NO Cuban Missile Crisis!  JFK almost got us \ninto a nuclear war because of his stupidity!\nAnd then we have the late great Norma Jeane Mortenson \u201cMarilyn Monroe\u201d.  \nShe was manipulated and lied to by both JFK and RFK! The preyed upon her \nweakness and used her for a piece of ass and tossed her out!  When she \nthreatened to expose both affairs with JFK and RFK she was silenced... RIP \nNorma Jeane. \n \nJFK and RFK knew Papa Joe used the Mafia to get them into The White House.  \nNow how stupid do you have to be to go after the people that got you \nelected? lol.  Not to mention threaten to dismantle the CIA?  Pretty \nfriggin stupid!  Your beloved JFK and his hack brother RFK played with fire \nand got burned!  They thought Papa Joe's stolen money would protect them. \nWell guess what?  They were wrong.  \n\nTeddy:  I guess Papa Joes stolen money saved his ass in 1969. That piece of \nshit drunk let Mary Jo Kopechne drown in Chappaquiddick. He should have \ngone to prison. \n\nAll and all, the Kennedy\u2019s were no better than the Mafia or CIA.  JFK and \nRFK went to war with people that were just as corrupt as they were, and \nthey lost.\n\nWith all of this being said, we will never know for a hardcore fact if it \nwas the Mafia, CIA, Mafia and CIA together, LHO, LBJ, Hoover, accident by \nthe Secret Service, or Marvin The Martian that whacked JFK.  It will always \nbe an enigma....\n \n\n                       "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRXcdK5vPakf0XOs2XQSWIg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "h m rowland", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z124jrig0xvbxn2ie04ce54ryzmtijpop50", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-23T12:43:32.299Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRXcdK5vPakf0XOs2XQSWIg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46804599999999996, "formal_score": 28, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-23T12:43:32.299Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106239405931804571113", "textDisplay": "+DJ JDB There is/was no evidence to convict Oswald.

Elsa will never look, \nand it is an unnerving thing when you want so badly to live in Oz, he will \nnever look or research to see the mountains of evidence available such as \nyour suggested Doug Horne videos and books, lone nutters refuse to look at \nanything that upsets their bowling league, Walmart, picket fence flag \nwaving the U.S. does no wrong belief system. It is a fact that my \ngeneration was injected with cancer cells along with our polio \nvaccine,documented. He won't research. It is a fact that Prescott Bush and \nmany american businessmen of the day financially supported Hitler to line \ntheir pockets,he won't bother to google 'Prescott Bush Hitler' to begin a \nstudy but its all there. He most likely thinks, if its even on his radar, \nthat the planes of JFK Jr. and Sen. Paul Wellstone just fell from the sky. \n He believes that Shirhan Shirhan killed RFK even though the LA county \ncoroner found that the Senator was shot at point blank range from 1\" BEHIND \nhis right ear. Then we have the 'lone nut' James earl Ray and the MLK \ngovernment assassination. Jack Ruby was the one man involved in the big \nevent who told us the truth when asked about the effects of the \nassassination he said. \"..a whole other form of government will take over \nthis country......I guess its too late to stop them.\" To be or not to be an \nostrich, bury my head and walk on past the truth....no, no I will choose to \nbe a truth monger (conspiracy theorist).  Harry Truman, on Dec. 21, 1963 \nsaid that \"the CIA MUST BE RETURNED TO its original purpose\", that \"it has \nbecome a danger to our society and our way of life\". Pass the torch my \nfriend....."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8PLb1k_XINk4SanPoRnzkQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Barry DeHatchett", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ggbtyyuaaxfinu23azlsaskfvfz3op04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-14T06:23:55.032Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8PLb1k_XINk4SanPoRnzkQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.57976800000000006, "formal_score": 12, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-14T06:23:55.032Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-UHkEEe0u3q4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/ztqGzejAdCo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104706064300006154405", "textDisplay": "+Elas Mobranch You are BY FAR the weakest lonenut defender that I have ever \nknown.

If you need help getting over this slight of \nhand get out your copy of Doug Horne's books on his ARRB findings on the \nmatter or if your not a researcher you can find the video here on YouTube. \nYou will find an interview with Dino Brugioni who handled the Z film for \nthe government in Washington the evening of the 22nd, November 1963. To \nstudy this case or any story that comes across the news, has to be looked \nat by being willing to not believe what your eyes see. I may see a cartoon \ncat eating real food on my screen but it doesn't mean that it was a live \nperformance. So what do we know for sure to add to that frame of film? We \nhave Officer Bobby Hargis who was riding the motorcycle left center of the \n4 Horsemen right behind Mrs. Kennedy, and his testimony about the blood \nsplatter and brain matter that was so intense that he thought he had been \nhit. Also there is the statement from Chief Curry that \"there must have \nbeen more than one involved because of the brain and blood on my officers \nbehind the limousine.\" then there are 9 Parkland doctors who said that \nthere was a wound of entry in the right temple exciting the occipital \nparietal bone.  There is evidence of film editing based on the blink rate \nof the flashers on the front of the limo. According to long time researcher \nRoy Schafer, Marine trained photo expert, that there should be 9 frames per \nflash based on the 18.3 frames per second presented by the Warren boys. \nUpon a little study the flasher rate does not, with consistency, run 9 \nframes on one side and then 9 on the other but they are in a broken pattern \n9/4, 7/3....and so on. If  you want more food for thought there is a stack \nof witness testimony about the actual size of the halo, about the car \nslowing to almost a stop which can be seen by the brake lights in the kill \nzone but the movement in the film never slows.  Once upon a time we were \nshown a man named Shirhan Shirhan shooting a Senator from the front, \nhowever the Dallas County Coroner found that the bullet that killed RFK had \nbeen fired from point blank range from behind his right ear. More recently, \nthe California shootings, we can be told anything terrorist/not terrorists. \nWe as a people were prepared in advance to hear about a terrorist attack in \nthe US. Policemen shoot innocents at an alarming rate, school \nshootings....numbing us, normalizing so that the ignorant live in fear and \nbecome more pliable. For what? A total police state instead of this partial \nwe live in, one that we will be happy to have because it makes us feel \nsafe. authoritarian and fascism taking over governments around the world, \nstay tuned and in the mean time try thinking of what might be the opposite \nof what your told and shown on the news, black is white and white is black \nmy friend.   I hope that helps you out.

Aside from that, President Kennedy's head \nwould have been directly perpendicular to a bullet path from the knoll \nwhich means a bullet would have entered the exact center right side of his \nhead which puts the exit point at the opposite side.  No one, even \nconspiracy theorists have shown any evidence of an exit from the left side \nof his head.  All of the conspiracies propose the bullet exited the back of \nhis head (which is absolutely untrue); that is impossible with a shot from \nthe grassy knoll.  It is easy to see the limo is about 70 degrees to a \npossible bullet path, Kennedy head is tilted towards the left and downward \napproximately 20 to 30 degrees. That makes Kennedy's head at a \nperpendicular angle to the knoll, maybe even up to a 100 degree angle from \na bullet path.

I lean towards the \nanti-conspiracy side, but I do so while wanting to believe in a conspiracy. \n\nThe closest I come to changing my mind is when I hear that \"LBJ did it\", \nbecause I despise LBJ and everything he did to this country and sincerely \nwant it to be proven that he was in on it to discredit him further (if \nthat's possible) and make him as despised in US history as he deserves to \nbe (somewhere along the lines of Benedict Arnold). A lot of the theories \nabout his motives are plausible, but so far there's no evidence. Will there \never be any? I doubt it. So as much as I want to believe it, I can't.\n\nSkepticism should be a two way street, but in JFK theories it doesn't seem \nto be. People who are so proudly skeptical of the US government line will \neagerly and na\u00efvely swallow any harebrained conspiracy theory that suits \ntheir fancy. Me, I'll be skeptical about the Warren Commission report, \nespecially considering that two of the worst Americans of the last century \n(LBJ and Earl Warren) have their fingerprints all over it. But I'll be \nequally as skeptical about Jim Marrs or Jim Garrison, who I find to be as \nloathsome as LBJ or Warren. On one hand you may may have a government cover \nup. On the other you have people ghoulishly profiteering (politically and \nfinancially) on the death of a man they piously claim to revere. The people \ninvolved in this whole thing professionally are too despicable to behold \nwithout making yourself feel dirty."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0K-Tiz2e6vVZVpwcztMyYg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "colin gentle", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12gg5oionf4wfkjm04ce51qyzrxejtwkfg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-05T10:53:52.001Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0K-Tiz2e6vVZVpwcztMyYg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.89933410000000003, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-05T10:53:52.001Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104266764484105289679", "textDisplay": "Okay , forget the 30 people that said shots from Grassy Knoll .

Fritz admitted that Oswald behaviour was not \nthat of a guilty man, but one who felt he would be proved innocent and that \nhe wanted a lawyer and was upset that he was \"denied representation\".\n\nNo, Oswald did not act in stereotypical manner that would have suited the \nWarren Commission. He even said to Capt. Fritz \"I have nothing against \nKennedy\" and that he liked Kennedy (later confirmed by a friend called \nPriscilla McMillan), and \"I hear that Johnson was been sworn in, that makes \nsense as governments has to have these contingencies\" and so on.

I have to admit and \nargue I major point the film and computer animation did appear to get 100% \nhistorical correct and that is if you go to about 13:01-13:03 in the video \nand they trace the shot back to the 6th floor window at no time do you see \nOswald or an Italian made rifle, nor the actual german mouser they found \nfirst ( and announced to the world for 1 day 1/2 Cronkite, Rather, \nABC,CBS,NBC all affiliates) it was probably not in that window anyway. I \nsubmit to your good judgement that the video is accurate at least in this \ninstance. \n\nThere are indeed many issues with this video. 1 I think thats gets over \nlooked a lot mainly by the lone shooter folks and the video. Oswald, he is \nalways portrayed as such a loser who could do nothing but shot the \npresident. If he really had no help of any kind and was a lone wolf his \nwhole life ( guilty or not ) was he such a idiot loser? His life before Nov \n63, 17, Joined the Marines, performs well enough to become a radar operator \nfor the U2 spy plane( owned and operated by the CIA). in Japan, during at \nwhich time ( if he had no help ) he learns Russian well enough to speak as \nwell as someone who had been privately tutored for 1/ 1/2 and also well \nenough to pass a military language test ( yes he got 2 more right than \nwrong- so if he got 50 right and 48 wrong and there are more than 100 words \non that exam, any) one else get 50 + words right ? Next he leaves the \nMarines and once again ( if no help is given ) he finds his way to Finland \nand then into the 1950's USSR ( The enemy who was set on destroying us all \n) and basically forces them into taking him in , giving him a job a crib, \nand hell man we will even set you up with some of the local babes. So he \nchills for a few years marries and then decides deuces USSR thanks it was \nfun but I am dippin. As if my man hasn't done enough already ( he is not \neven 24 yet how many folks have even done what he has to this point) After \ndefecting he rolls back to the US with new Russian wife& child ( in the \n50's) and having told upon his exit he was going to share secrets, he is \nnow on the CIA and FBI mail intercept program , my MAN O, talks I guess \nwhat the lady at the embassy in Moscow to not only issue all of them new \npassports oh yeah I need that in 48 Hr (chop chop), not only does all that \ngo down but the nice people also loaned him the money to travel, Or he \npulls the biggest James Bond moves ever Naaa. I guess him coming back just \nbored him hanging with the white Russian social elite of TX the whole \nsettling down thing, so he hooked up with some no doubt REAL OGs from Cuba \nin NaOlens and lord only knows who else. Just some homies kicking it with \nAKs and enough arms to invade an island ( oh yeah Cuba ) . That side gets \nboring so he jumps to the pro Castro group just so he can get on TV and \nsuch I mean you know its not like partying back in the USSR or watching to \nU2 as it flies over the USSR, so what do you do to top all that . Shoot the \nman , he has already held one super power at bay why not take out the 2nd \nwith my AK \" I guess you could say was good day \" Save the best for last, I \nwould like to see how many people would be as cool and collected as that \ncat was in the face of the world ( he was giving nationwide press \nconferences in handcuffs ) cool, calm, ask for legal counsel , most people \nwould be pissing their pants and throwing out names of their grandmother to \nsave their ass or Claiming their cause of why they did such a righteous \ndeed. O gave them nothing and,zero. Then he left this world at 24.

According to this, YOUR video. \n\n9m 20s or so into this video we are told that at about frame 160 was the \nfirst shot.\n\nWe believe this to be the truth as we clearly see Governor Connally day \ndreaming while looking to his left and then in an instant look to the \nright. \n\nHe later reports that was the moment of the first shot, from the right. \n(bullet 1) so that establishes this frame as bullet 1. \n\nYour video also tells me that 1/4 a second pass between frame 160 and frame \n167.   Which says that 28 frames is one second.     \n\nFrame 223 we are told is the frame that Connally is hit so it must also be \nthe frame that President Kennedy was first shot.  (bullet 2)\n\nSo what do we see Connally do at frame 250, turn to his right and appear to \nspeak.\n\nNow stop and consider this.\nFrame 250 is equal to 3 seconds after Connally first hears a high power \nrife shot and a 1/4 of a second after he is shot.\n\nAnd yet the fatal shot has still not happened.  Its coming in a little \nwhile. \n\nWe are not told what frame number for bullet 3 but clearly the time span \nhas to be in line with the gap between the first and second, so its another \n3 seconds to fire bullet 3.\n\nAll of this says that there was over 6 seconds between the first shot and \nthe third shot and about a second later we see the car finally increasing \nspeed to escape.  \n\nSeriously America.  Somebody over there needs to look long and hard at the \ntraining for secret service agents,  everyone looks to have been asleep,  \nincluding one of the guys shot.  \n\nPlease do not tell me that of all the people at the location on the day \nonly Connally knew what a shot sounds like.  \nWhy did the car not accelerate away after the first shot???\n\nWhy did no one scream bullet, bullet, bullet at that moment???\n\nUpon the president first being shot,  why not get out of there fast???  \n\nWhy did Miss Kennedy or even Connelly not scream we are under fire or at a \nminimum punch the driver in the head to get his attention??? \n \nEven if every one missed the first,  how did no one notice the second as \nthat one damaged the car including the windscreen.  \n\nNot my conspiracy theory. \nI am just stating the facts as shown on this video.

You sure spread the bs on the bread. The \nrifle you speak of was purchased by, someone, likely the \ndouble, from Kline's Sporting Goods in Chicago and sent to a Dallas POB and \nwas supposedly picked up in January '63... while Oswald was living in New \nOrleans, according to the official story. The money order used to purchase \nit by this Alek Hiddel was never cashed. The Carcano in question was, \naccording to the WCR was forty inches long. However the issue of the \n\"American Rifle\" magazine from which the ad appeared that was supposedly \nused to order the weapon only offered a 36\" model. This fact was confirmed \nby Klien's, they placed different ads in different magazines to track \neffectiveness. The rifle may well have been picked up by the double but it \nwas not Harvey Oswald. \n\nThis discussion is as moot as testing the gun , the Carcano was not used in \nthe assassination so it doesn't really matter where it came from or who \npicked it up. It was planted and involved only from a cover story aspect. \nWhen the FBI experts tested the rifle they had to shim the scope to even \nbring it to center to test it. You can find pictures of the 3 shim I the \nWCR. The Italians called this gun \"the rifle that never killed anyone, on \npurpose\". It was the joke of WWII. All of the first day news reports \nreported that the gun found was a Mauser 7.5,see the signed affidavit by \nthe DPD weapons expert and Officer Boone that this was the gun found on the \n6th floor, the Carcano didn't appear until Saturday morning.

Why do I say this?\n\n\"Archive Photos Not of JFK's Brain, Concludes Aide to Review Board Archive \nWashington Post\n\nTuesday, November 10, 1998;32-page report by Douglas Horne, the board's \nchief analyst for military records:\n\n\"The central contention of the report is that brain photographs in the \nKennedy records are not of Kennedy's brain and show much less damage than \nKennedy sustained when he was shot in Dallas and brought to Parkland \nHospital there on Nov. 22, 1963. The doctors at Parkland told reporters \nthen that they thought Kennedy was shot from the front and not from behind \nas the Warren Commission later concluded. \"I am 90 to 95 percent certain \nthat the photographs in the Archives are not of President Kennedy's brain,\" \nHorne, a former naval officer, said in an interview. \"If they aren't, that \ncan mean only one thing -- that there has been a coverup of the medical \nevidence.\" Horne contends that the damage to the second brain reflected a \nshot from behind. He says the first brain was Kennedy's and reflected a \nshot from the front.\nThe report points to, for instance, the testimonies of former FBI agent \nFrancis X. O'Neill Jr., who was present at the Nov. 22, 1963, autopsy at \nBethesda Naval Hospital, and of former Navy photographer John T. Stringer, \nwho said he took photos at a supplementary brain examination two or three \ndays later, probably on the morning of Nov. 25.\nO'Neill told the board in a 1997 deposition that at the Nov. 22 autopsy \n\"there was not too much of the brain left\" when it was taken out of \nKennedy's skull and \"put in a white jar.\" He said \"more than half of the \nbrain was missing.\"\nShown the brain photographs deeded to the Archives by the Kennedy family, \nwhich were taken sometime after the autopsy, O'Neill said they did not \nsquare with what he saw. The \"only section of the brain which is missing is \nthis small section over here,\" O'Neill said of one photograph. \"This looks \nalmost like a complete brain.\"\nStringer said the photos he took at the \"supplementary examination\" \nconducted by J. Thornton Boswell and James Humes did not resemble those at \nthe Archives. He said they seemed to be on \"a different type of film\" from \nthe one he used.\""}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7BvGa1oF9s4s9ZaOs5TeQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "D.

Had it been fired \nfrom the sniper's nest, it would have either exited the chest or remained \nin the body.\n\nFBI marksman Robert Frazier, who tested the rifle in two sets of tests, \ntestified to the Warren Commission that he could not reach the 5.6 second \nmark for firing three shots and that all his shots fired five inches high \nand five inches to the right due to an uncorrectable deficiency in the \ntelescopic sight.\n\nThere is some evidence to support the proposition that Oswald had been \nemployed by federal agencies in various capacities:\n\nhttp://rense.com/general62/oswald.htm\n\nA member of the FBI\u2019s office in New Orleans, William Walter, claimed that \nhe had seen an FBI teletype that showed that Oswald had been an informant \nfor that office: \nhttp://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=95331\n\nA former CIA payroll officer claimed that it was widely assumed among his \nCIA colleagues that Oswald had been a full\u2013time employee of the agency:\n\nhttp://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=260\n\nSee also James B. Wilcott, \u2018The Assassination of John. F. Kennedy: A CIA \nInsider\u2019s View,\u2019 Stray Magazine, February 1989, p.38.\n\nJack Ruby:\n\nA number of writers have suspected Jack Ruby of being linked to organized \ncrime, and some have gone on to hypothesize that his alleged links to \norganized crime were evidence of conspiracy to kill Lee Harvey Oswald \nand/or John F. Kennedy. The House Select Committee on Assassinations said \nthat Jack Ruby knew restaurateurs Sam (1920\u20131970) and Joseph Campisi \n(1918\u20131990) since 1947, and had been seen with them on many occasions. \n\nAfter an investigation of Joe Campisi, the HSCA found, While Campisi's \ntechnical characterization in Federal law enforcement records as an \norganized crime member has ranged from definite to suspected to negative, \nit is clear that he was an associate or friend of many Dallas-based \norganized crime members, particularly Joseph Civello during the time he was \nthe head of the Dallas organization. There was no indication that Campisi \nhad engaged in any specific organized crime-related activities. \n\nSimilarly, a PBS Frontline investigation into the connections between Ruby \nand Dallas organized crime figures reported the following: \n\nIn 1963, Sam and Joe Campisi were leading figures in the Dallas underworld. \nJack knew the Campisis and had been seen with them on many occasions. The \nCampisis were lieutenants of Carlos Marcello, the Mafia boss who had \nreportedly talked of killing the President. \n\nA day before Kennedy was murdered, Ruby went to Joe Campisi's restaurant.At \nthe time of the Kennedy assassination, Ruby was close enough to the \nCampisis to ask them to come see him after he was arrested for shooting Lee \nOswald. \n\nRuby went to Cuba in 1959, ostensibly to visit a friend, influential Dallas \ngambler Lewis McWillie, an associate of Mafia boss Santo Trafficante. \n(Trafficante operated major casinos in Cuba and was briefly imprisoned \nafter Fidel Castro came to power.) The House Select Committee on \nAssassinations inferred from Ruby's trip to Cuba, and his subsequent trips, \n\"...that Ruby was at least serving as a kind of courier on behalf of \ngambling interests in Cuba.\"\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12duhcwcpfaupt5204cidd4pqvotbhjlkg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNhBKM-duVixbt6jb5nmrew", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZrqEpJ8v6mI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB8/6V4ziN8ndPA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "brtherjohn", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2013-12-18T00:42:18.726Z", "videoId": "35SGFzKRUS8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNhBKM-duVixbt6jb5nmrew"}, "sentiment_score": 0.49235600000000002, "formal_score": 98, "updatedAt": "2013-12-18T00:42:18.726Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115732845042510249016", "textDisplay": "From 1:22, or about that, closes the case completely.

After all, every single \nwitness that gave a statement ONLY mentions the back of his head having \nbeen blown off or out means they certainly did see it! The ONLY reason his \nhead looks as it does in the Zapruder film is simply done by drawing it on \nto the frames. The ONLY reason the official (my ass they are) autopsy \nphotos and x-rays look as they do is because of the butchers in that \nautopsy room! No other reason! Period! The photographer dis-avowed the \nphotos as being his and the x-ray tech pointed out that the x-rays were on \nthe wrong film to have been from Bethesda. There were only 2 honest people \nin that autopsy room and they too described the same head wound as the fine \nfolks at Parkland did as did the witnesses to the shooting as did Clint \nHill himself! A big hole the size of a fist in the back right side of his \nhead. Nothing else.

A single finger print (with 34 matching \npoints) from Wallace was later discovered on one of the boxes at the ' \nsnipers nest '.\n\nTwo cops signed sworn affidavits that a Mauser rifle (NOT a carcanno) was \nfound on the 6th floor of the TSBD (one of whom was a gun expert and owned \na sporting goods (gun) store.   One of them later said he was mistaken \n(like a lot of witnesses after pressure from the FBI)    'Mauser' was \nstamped on the barrel and this was seen from a distance of 12-18 inches.\n\nRuby actually stated to the press that LBJ was ultimately responsible.\n\nDorothy Kilgallen was murdered to silence her and what she had learned from \ninterviewing Jack Ruby.   A few weeks later her closest friend with whom \nshe had discussed the case was also murdered.\n\nThe Zapruder film shows signs of alteration (heads turning at ridiculously \nhigh speed from one frame to the next, a persons leg moving between frames \nat impossible speed (indicating missing frames), the lamp post looks \ndistinctly unnatural and has a abrupt fringe around it (have a look \nyourself!) indicating that the lamp post has been included in the bottom \nhalf of a re-timed 'composite'.   The limo appears to hardly slow at all - \nwhich conflicts with many witness statements that state that the limo \nabruptly braked and almost stopped.   Also the spectators on the grass are \nabout 30% disproportionately too large.\n\nThe two women on the (wooden) stairs of the TSBD in the seconds after the \nassassination reported NO ONE passing them on the stairs (the elevator was \nout of action).  Even if they had not seen someone they would have heard \nthem.  Oswald was discovered calm, relaxed and breathing normally on the \nsecond floor 90-120 seconds after the assassination.  The Warren Commission \nblatantly an dishonestly altered the time the women gave that they were on \nthe stairs to explain away why they saw no one.\n\nEvery Parkland doctor and surgeon said that JFK had a large gaping hole \n(exit wound) at the right REAR of the head.  It is therefore impossible for \nOswald to have produced that wound.    Dr Mc Clelland has always stated \nthat he believes the bullet entered at the right temple area and exited \nbehind the right ear (from the front)\n\nWhen you draw an imaginary line through JFK's back wound (3rd Thoracic \nvertebrae) through to the throat wound, the angle of trajectory is too flat \nto have come from the TSBD.    It either came from lower down in the Daltex \nbuilding or from the front (the knoll or the overpass area)    It also \nmeans that Connally was hit by a separate bullet.   Connally always thought \nhe was hit by a separate bullet.     Gerald Ford was part of the cover up \nand knowing the back wound location was at odds with the single bullet \ntheory dishonestly and falsely repositioned the BACK wound five inches \nhigher to the back of the NECK to comply with Alen Specter's invented \nsingle bullet theory.\n\nThe bullets recovered from the Tippet shooting could NEVER be forensically \nmatched with Oswald's revolver.\n\nThe autopsy photos (and the X rays) contradict the doctors statements and \nevery one of the Parklands doctors that have seen the autopsy photos and X \nrays have said that they do not reflect what they saw in trauma room 1 on \n11/22/63.   The X rays purport to show damage to the front of the head. \n There was NO such damage to the front of the head.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13vurnzrxrvdhusr22ki1iaozmpyrsqh04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCakC1y5E43zbPM-GZDvOSpA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MrTtrn001", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-19T20:44:02.867Z", "videoId": "35SGFzKRUS8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCakC1y5E43zbPM-GZDvOSpA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0063159999999999883, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-19T20:44:02.867Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102285822671477736222", "textDisplay": "It wasn't a conspiracy.

COnely who was one of the \nvictims said the warren commission was FULL OF SHIT and says no way in hell \nwas it only one shooter. and Jacky even said her self that it was LBJ who \nhad her husband killed. and she seen more of jfks head explode then clint \nhill did and if just seeing his head explode gives some ones opinion weight \nor not HERS SHOULD out weigh clints being she got it all over her pretty \ndress that she even refused to change and wanted lbj to see the blood he \nspilled on her when they murdered her husband.  also Clint hill cant be \nruled out as covering for any one or not being he was NOT JFKs body guard \nand he was actually Jacky and even some possibility that he was bonking her \nbeing she did also have her own affairs and she and Clint were very very \nclose and he spent more time alone with her then any one else . and tho I \ncant prove it I have my suspicions they were closer then just a body guard \nand his assigned person to guard. i think they very well could of been \nlovers and he does seem to try to protect her that day even tho that day he \nwas not there as her body guard but was also there because she convinced \nher husband to request he be there on the trip and if they were not lovers \nthey were at least great admirers of each other and it cant even be hidden \nif one were to watch any of them two interactions and looks in any films \nand photos of Clint and Jacky in each others presence.  also clint never \never spoke publicly about any of the things he has intlll after she passed \naway. \n    "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CRoNbhFAIYQPpoynKyR9w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "fobrien1", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13nvxf5oyaddr4bb04cdb4xqpjkub4o4e4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-27T00:31:08.058Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5CRoNbhFAIYQPpoynKyR9w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.78752200000000006, "formal_score": 19, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-27T00:31:08.058Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115485775479978800505", "textDisplay": "+Artful Dodger\n\n\nwell dodger you make a good point WHY CONDUCT THE TEST ? , in all likley \nhood even had oswald tested posted on his cheek the nitrate tests wouldnt \nhave been admitted into a court of law , so in that sense it was a futile \nexercise . they conducted the test in the hope that oswalds hands and face \ntested positive , then they could say look lee we got you as you failed the \ntest , then their hope is he will confess . if oswald confessed they \nwouldnt then need the nitrate test evidence .\neven had the nitrate test been some what accurate the actions of the dpd \nnullified the results . ink / print ink was one thing which caused a false \npositive , before they gave him the nitrate test they finger and palm \nprinted him putting ink all over his hands and palms , any defence lawyer \nworth anything would have had the test results thrown out over that ."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQEbMls7kgSeNmdiHOi1yg", "inappropriate_score": 0.76628352490421459, "authorDisplayName": "j james", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13nvxf5oyaddr4bb04cdb4xqpjkub4o4e4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-25T01:58:11.606Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfQEbMls7kgSeNmdiHOi1yg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.68423199999999995, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-25T01:58:11.606Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112038493385211769670", "textDisplay": "+Lorraine Tauson\n even better ? of when was the only other time in history that any one \nfired 3 shots from a bolt action with out getting some residue.

The results were positive for the hands and negative for the \nright cheek. Expert testimony before the Commission was to the effect that \nthe paraffin test was unreliable in determining whether or not a person has \nfired a rifle or revolver. The Commission has, therefore, placed no \nreliance on the paraffin tests administered by the Dallas police.\" ( warren \ncommission Report, Chap. 4 pg. 180 )\n\n\nThe reason why the chemical test is considered unreliable is because the \nchemicals used react with other items, making it impossible to determine \nwhether the residues came from gunpowder.\n\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. ...... the reagents used in these two tests are not \nspecific for gunpowder residues. Now, it is true that the nitrates and \nnitrites in gunpowder residues will react positively with diphenylamine and \ndiphenylbenzidine, but they are not specific. They will react--these two \nreagents will react with most oxidizing agents.\nMr. EISENBERG. Can you give us a few examples?\nMr. CUNNINGHAM. Yes. Urine, tobacco, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, soil, \nfertilizer--I have a list here of the different families or classes of \ncompounds that will react. In addition to nitrates and nitrites, substances \nsuch as dichromates, permanganates, hypochlorites, periodates, some oxides, \nsuch as selenium dioxide and so forth. Also, ferric chloride and chromates \nand chlorates. The list of oxidizing agents is so large that will \nreact--that you cannot specifically say it was a gunpowder residue. \n(cunningham fbi warren commission testimony)\n\n\"Then explain how anybody operating A BOLT ACTION RIFLE, firing it three \ntimes, could avoid getting a face full of expelled gun smoke and residue \nevery time he popped the bolt.\" artful dodger\n\nthats sort of the point dodger , tests indicate oswald should (if he fired \nthe rifle ) have had residue on his cheek but he didnt . but then the \nparaffin test isnt reliable , the cheek could be a false negative , then \nthe hands could be a false positive there in is the problem."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CRoNbhFAIYQPpoynKyR9w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "fobrien1", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13nvxf5oyaddr4bb04cdb4xqpjkub4o4e4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-08T21:17:01.361Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5CRoNbhFAIYQPpoynKyR9w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.481908, "formal_score": 73, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-08T21:17:01.361Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115485775479978800505", "textDisplay": "+ckom0007\n\n\n\"Paraffin tests are used to scare the weak of mind into confessing.

Not being one of the \n\"conspiracy loons\" I could not and can not tell you what I do not know and \npass it off as a fact\u2026. I can tell you a fact though\u2026. there is a \ndifference between a theory and a fact.  Agreed?  So the reason I don't \ntell you exactly how the assignation happened is that I can not honestly \ntell you with any accuracy how it happened because I was not there\u2026  I can \ntell you how I FEEL or HOW I REACT to information and evidence that is \nprovided and I can tell you what I perceive and that is what I stated \noriginally.  Im not one to be pulled into arguments and I DON'T care what \nyou or anybody believes I am just expressing what I believe.  You may do \nthe same.  I don't believe in any of the theories shown on the film and NOR \ndo I thing the film even attempted to present OTHER theories and there are \nmany of them.  I am inclined to think that there was a gunman on the Grassy \nKnoll\u2026. I am inclined to think that the Security detail that decided not to \nride on his Limo and the Secret Service order to stay back was an \nindication that someone - I don't know how many - but someone made that \ncall and those Service Men were told to stand back and that is a matter of \nfact in public records and interviews of the men from that day\u2026. it \nindicates there were other people involved in the events that made the \nshooting possible\u2026.  Someone decided to make a turn rather than have the \nmotorcade go straight that day.  I know peronally as a FACT Marco because \n friend of Mine was the Naval Officer in Charge of the presidents travel \nand the routes he takes\u2026 to know that those things are decided an planned \nin advance\u2026. Some one CHOOSE to put the Limo where it went\u2026 that is a fact \nnot some last minute random decision\u2026. and I do not think that Oswald had \nthat power to decide or even know the exact route and time\u2026. and if he knew \nthe route because it was published and took advantage of that so be it\u2026If \nhe was such a great gunman that he could pull the fire mechanism 3 times in \nthat brief few seconds and with precision hit a target then Wow more power \nto him - but I doubt it was so given the fact that many test and time \ntrials with sharp shooter trained marines were performed and none of them \nwere able to accomplish that\u2026. hell he was so small and tiny a fella the \ngun was bigger than him\u2026. I doubt he could recoil well enough\u2026. but I \ndigress\u2026  It is thought that it is better not to \"tell you how it happened\" \nbecause I can not be an expert on that\u2026. I can tell you what I think \nbecause I can be an expert of that.  I can share my observations.  wether \nyou agree with them or not doesn't matter to me\u2026. I can observe that your \nwords show you have a lot of emotion about the situation and a lot of \njudgment about conspiracy loons and that you consider the video discussed \nas accurate\u2026 well great\u2026.  what does it matter what I or anyone else \nthinks\u2026.

This morning I watched \"I \nLove Lucy\" and two episodes of \"Andy Griffith\" while reading a book from \n1922, \"Siddhartha\" by Herman Hess. \"Siddhartha\" was an unlikely top 10 read \n93 years ago. It was a best seller in the '60's and is a classic today. \nThere are over 2700 titles on the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1963, 6 million documents \nin the National Achieves with more to come in 2038, many films and \ndocumentaries, organizations dedicated to supplying information and \noffering a platform for research and discussion about the events of \nNovember 22, 1963. You may be correct in that the dumbing down of the \npopulace by our new government will curtail interest; there may be those \nwho continue to believe the TV news rather than the truth, and the cover up \nperpetuated by the propaganda media assets of the 4th branch. However \nGeneral the questions created by dedicated citizen patriots will never die. \nSome smart historian years down the line will wonder why the Department of \nJustice never investigated the violent removal of an elected president and \nthe change of direction of this country and if the Fascist CIA allows that \nquestioning into public domain then the truth will be carried on.  One day \nthe suppression by the media of the unanimous jury decision in 1985's 11th \nDistrict of the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York which found E.

Kennedy\". \nThat case and the decision ended the question of was there a conspiracy. \nJack Ruby said it best when he remarked that because of the assassination \" \na whole other form of government will take over this country.\" Through \nhindsight the educated and intelligent will see that that is exactly what \nhappened. You may be correct and the ignorant masses will throw down on \nOswald and reject conspiracy but they don't really care what is shit and \nwhat is shinola as long as they can go to Walmart and McDonald's on Friday \nnight and parrot the words of disinformation made available to them like a \nbig bass confronted with a night crawler on a shinning hook. You are \nunderestimating those of us who take responsibility for sharing and \nteaching the truth about government murders from JFK to JFK Jr. I will, \nthanks to you, double my efforts to 'pass the torch to a new \ngeneration\".
