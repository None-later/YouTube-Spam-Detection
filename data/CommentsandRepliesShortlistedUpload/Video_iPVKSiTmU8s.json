But, the country was very densely populated.\n* From the 16th century until the last decades of the 19th century the \npopulation numbered about 250,000.\n* Most Palestinians immigrated to the Holy Land between the 19th and 20th \ncenturies, during the Ottoman rule (1516 \u2013 1918) and the British Mandate \nrule (1918 \u2013 1948).Jewish settlement in Palestine during the British \nMandate period and development works by the government created new and \nvaried industries and construction projects, thus creating an abundance of \nwork places, which attracted immigrant workers from Arabic and Muslim \ncountries.Arabs penetrated into the land of Israel (the ancient name of \nPalestine) in 4 wavesFirst Wave(7TH Century) The first wave was after the \noccupation of the country by the Arabs in the 7th century A.D. The Arab \u2013 \nMuslim occupation of Palestine lasted about 400 years (640 \u2013 1099). Most \nscholars agree that the ethnic- religious structure of the population \nremained essentially unchanged from the days of the Byzantine occupation \n(324CE \u2013 640CE), and the majority of the population consisted of Greek \nOrthodox Christians and 2 minorities: Jews and Samaritans. The number of \nArabs settled in Palestine was negligible.The Muslim army emerging from the \nArabian Peninsula was comprised of Bedouin warriors who moved along with \ntheir families and flocks. Prof Moshe Sharon, rejects the theory that the \n7th century Arabic conquest was immediately accompanied by massive Arabic \nsettlement in the country. He gives several reasons for the absence of \nmassive Arabic penetration into the Land of Israel prior to the 9th \ncentury\u2026\u2026 An Arabic 9th century source attests to the composition of the \ncoastal cities population, which included Jews, Samaritans, Persians, \nGreeks, and a few Arabs.At a later stage, soldiers released from the \nCaliph\u2019s Muslim army settled in villages and towns that had been deserted \nby Christians fleeing ahead of the Arab conquerors, but no numerical data \nis available.In summary, Umayyad rulers\u2019 policies did not emphasize Arabic \nsettlement in the country nor the conversion of its population, but rather \nacculturation, the introduction of the Arabic language and culture while \nprotecting the local population against Bedouin raids that harmed farming. \nIslamization policies were hardly enforced with only a few exceptions, as \nduring the time of the Caliph Omar II (717-720). Acculturation \n(Arabization) advanced faster than Islamization. No significant change in \nthe population composition took place and the population remained mostly \nChristian, with Jewish and Samaritan minorities.Second Wave(Middle of the \n10th Century \u2013 11th Century)The second wave came from the middle of the \n10th century until the occupation of the country by the Crusaders in 1099. \nDuring these years Beduins (Arab nomad tribes) from the deserts of Arabia, \nTrans-jordan, Syrian desert, Sinai and Egypt invaded the country and \ngradually settled in deserted villages after they robbed and have driven \nout the local peasants, many of them Jews. Still, the country was settled \nalong religious- ethnic lines with small enclaves: The north of the Shomron \nmountain became Arabic, but the south and the Jerusalem area was Christian, \nand so was the western Galilee. The eastern Galilee was Jewish and the \nCities along the shore were mixed, with a Christian majority.The Population \nduring Crusaders\u2019 Rule (1099 -1260)The Crusaders massacred during the \nconquest of the country many Muslims and many others ran away. During the \nCrusaders rule the Northern part of the country, the Galliee, was settled \nby Christians in the west and Jews in the east with some Arabic \nenclaves.The mountains of Samaria were settled by Arabs and Samaritans, but \nthe mountains of Judea and around Jerusalem was mostly Christian, with some \nArabic enclaves.The Southern part of the country was mostly settled by \nBedouins, who were nomads.In short, out of 470,000 people who lived in the \nHoly Land the Christians were the largest religious group \u2013 about 320,000: \nabout 200,000 were\nof Syrian- Aramaic (non- Arabs) origin and about 120,000 were Crusaders.The \nPopulation during Mamluks\u2019 Rule (1260 \u2013 1516)The Mamluks conquered most of \nthe country from the Crusaders in 1260. They destroyed the cities along the \nshores of the Mediterranean Sea between 1260 \u2013 1290. These cities were \npopulated mostly by Christians of Syrian \u2013 Aramaic origin. Many were \nmassacred or ran away before the Mameluk army arrived\u2026\u2026 The rate of \nPalestine\u2019s population decreased dramatically because of massacres, \nemigration of Christians, the Black Death, and the economic situation.\nA certain amount of Christians were forced to convert to Islam.The \nPopulation during Ottomans\u2019 Rule (1516 \u2013 1918)\u2026 The population at the end \nof the 16th century grew to 206, 290, and the country remained mostly \nuncultivated and densely populated.The Third Wave (16th \u2013 17th Century)\u2026 \nthe economic situation and the lack of personal security caused people to \nleave, Muslims included.During the 17th- 18th centuries the population \nbecame smaller and smaller. Tourists from Europe and the United States who \nvisited the country described an uncultivated deserted land.The Fourth \nWave, Part One (1832 \u2013 1917)The last and the largest wave came between \naround the middle- end of the 19th century and 1948 when Israel was \nestablished. This wave started during the conquest of the country by the \nson of Muhammad Ali between 1832 1840.Egypt settled along the shore and the \nvalleys, about 100,000 Egyptian peasants. Also, Arabs and Muslims were \ninvited by the Ottoman rulers to settle in the deserted country. The \nZuabbian tribe was invited in 1873 from Irbid, Trans-Jordan to settle in \nthe southern Galilee and the Izrael Valley. Muslims from Muslim countries \nsuch as Kurds and Cireassians settled in the north.Historians are divided \non the size of the population on the eve of the British conquest of \nPalestine. The views range from 100,000 to 400,000, but most think the rate \nof the Arab-Muslim population was about 250,000.The Population during the \nBritish Mandate Period (1918 \u2013 1948)The Fourth Wave, Part Two (1917 \u2013 \n1948)The second part of the largest wave came during the British Mandate \noccupation, between 1917 and 1948 when Israel was established. Arabs and \nMuslims from Arabic and Muslim countries entered illegally the country \nunder the Turks and latter the British mandate from the eastern, northern \nand southern borders looking for jobs created by the Zionist movement and \nlatter by the British Mandate (1918 \u2013 1948).\nThe Arab population of the Sharon area (between Tel Aviv and Haifa, the \ncenter of Jewish settlements) grew from 10,000 to more than 30,000 from \n1922 \u2013 1940s.\nThe Arab population of the south (between Jaffa and the Egyptian border) \ngrew by more than 200% between 1917 \u2013 1940s. About 35,000 Arabs from the \nHaurain, South Syria came looking for work.From 1870 to 1948 the Arabic \npopulation grew by 270%. Even in Egypt, the Arab country with the highest \nbirth rate, the rate was only 105%, which proves that a significant part of \nthe Arabic population growth came from immigration. By 1921when the British \ngovernment performed its first census the number of Arabs and Muslims \namounted to about 500,000. The 1931 British Census included about 30 \ndifferent languages spoken by the Muslim population in Palestine. They were \nillegal immigrant workers from Arabic and Muslim countries. The high rate \nof children\u2019s deaths, law life expectancy and the lack of health services \nin the country made it impossible to reach 270% as a result of birth \nrate.In Short, from about 250,000 around the end of the 19th century, many \nof them bedouins, the Arabic population grew to about 1,250,000 in 1948. \nThe Palestinian claim that they are the ancient population of the so called \nPalestine has no ground.Winston Churchill, said in May 22, 1939 that the \nArab immigration to Palestine during the British Mandate was so large that \ntheir numbers grew in such proportion that even if all Jews immigrated to \nPalestine they could not reach that number\u2026"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi4Etc5jhvCIssG0T4GC5Bw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bruce Campbell", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ndrborniswdkgt04cgzxpyunzx1u4vhg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-02T01:52:19.477Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCi4Etc5jhvCIssG0T4GC5Bw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.56634000000000007, "formal_score": 14, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-02T01:55:20.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--O3Eb12ychA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADw/ai4KKN19ycI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108673035982168436527", "textDisplay": "+RR Sandler I'm sure every Palestinian would agree that history speaks for \nitself.

The EU said \nthe fence is necessary to \u201cprevent the free movement of migrants seeking to \nenter\u201d EU territory.  Israeli companies that specialize in the construction \nof fences and security systems will participate in tenders to build \nhundreds of miles of fences along the EU\u2019s new eastern border. \u201cIt\u2019s \nincredible the EU has no problem building a fence just to keep illegal \nimmigrants out, but when the Jewish State builds a security fence as a last \nresort for the purpose of keeping terrorists out and saving Israeli lives, \nwe are blasted by them and the U.N.,\u201d a spokesman for Ariel Sharon told \nWorldNetDaily. \u201cMakes you think, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dIsrael\u2019s publicly traded Magal \nSecurity Systems, which participated in the construction of the West Bank \nsecurity fence, is expected to sign a cooperation agreement for building \nthe new EU fence and its attendant command-and-control systems.  The \nultimate contract is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars. \nEach kilometer of Israel\u2019s fence cost $1 million to build. Bases, \nsophisticated transit points, and observation and command-and-control \nsystems cost $2 million per kilometer.  In July, the U.N.\u2019s high court \nruled Israel\u2019s security fence, which is credited with keeping suicide \nbombers out, violates international law and must be dismantled.The court, \nwhich Israel maintains has no jurisdiction over Israeli matters, ruled \n\u201c[it] is not convinced that the specific course Israel has chosen for the \nwall was necessary to attain its security objectives.\u201d  A week later, the \nU.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution demanding that \nIsrael comply with the world court decision and tear down the security \nfence.  Most European countries voted against Israel.\n\n             \u201cEuropean hypocrisy is as rank as it is blatant,\u201d Daniel \nPipes, director of the Middle East Forum, told WorldNetDaily. \u201cAnd the EU \nwall is not even for security reasons, just economic ones.\u201d"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqG5n1TmdxuIY52hHBzYCsw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Culturebreach", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mtxp4lkvzinvu423zhrhjzpudj50tw", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-12T01:01:40.208Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqG5n1TmdxuIY52hHBzYCsw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.23704799999999998, "formal_score": 9, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-12T01:01:40.208Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7GIQKmxmNRo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/Fvz_3yUtHP0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117109013421409383843", "textDisplay": "+RR Sandler Ah yes the wonderful Pharaoh Sisi who killed 1400 people at \nRaba a year or 2 ago.

(AP \nPhoto/MENA, Mohammed Samaha) (The Associated Press)Once again, a government \nis considering building a wall along its border with Gaza and destroying \ntunnels it claims Hamas uses to conduct terrorist attacks \u2013 but this time \nit is Egypt and not Israel.In the wake of Friday\u2019s attack in northern \nSinai, which killed 33 Egyptian soldiers, Cairo has raised the idea of a \nbuilding an eight-mile barrier along its border with Gaza to deter Islamist \nterrorists from moving in and out of the Palestinian territory.\u201cThere is a \nbig conspiracy against us,\u201d Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi said in \na live, televised address Saturday, in which he blamed \u201cforeign powers\u201d for \nthe atrocity and said Egypt is locked in an \u201cexistential war\u201d.Egypt, which \nhas declared a three-month state of emergency in northern Sinai, also \ncancelled its planned role as mediator between Israel and Hamas in talks \naimed at maintaining a ceasefire that has held since the end of the summer \nconflict.Friday\u2019s sophisticated terrorist attack - which Egyptian \nauthorities have indicated likely came from Gaza - was launched on Egyptian \ntroops with devastating effect. Old tunnels that had yet to be destroyed by \nEgyptian forces or newly-dug tunnels that had not been detected were likely \nused in the attack that combined the use of a suicide bomber on one hand, \nwith rocket propelled grenades and roadside bombs on the other.Local \nEgyptian media has reported that Sisi has sent reinforcements to bolster 12 \nexisting battalions as well as sending Egypt\u2019s elite 777th and 999th units \nto strategic locations in northern Sinai and that helicopter gunships \nkilled six terrorist on Sunday. Egypt is facing a serious threat in Sinai \nfrom, among others, the Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis Islamist terror group, which \nappears to be using Gaza as a safe haven. The terrorists are believed to be \ncrossing via terror tunnels, even though Egypt has reportedly destroyed \nmore than 1,800 underground passages in a bid to clamp down on Hamas and \nother terror groups operating there.\n\u201cI understand [Egypt] would like to create a buffer zone where there are no \nhouses and no vegetation.\u201d- Zvi Mazel, former Israeli Ambassador to \nEgyptHamas, which has launched thousands of rockets into Israel from Gaza\u2019s \nnorthern border in the last year, has also sought to strike a blow at \nal-Sisi\u2019s forces as payback for the former Egyptian military leader\u2019s \noverthrowing of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas\u2019 parent \norganization.Following Friday\u2019s attack, the Rafah crossing between southern \nGaza and Egypt was closed immediately and will reportedly remain closed \nindefinitely. Hamas leaders have reportedly stated that Gaza will \u201cexplode\u201d \nif the Rafah crossing is not re-opened quickly.While the southern crossing \ninto Egypt is closed, other border crossings with Israel remain open. \nHumanitarian and trade supplies are being delivered by Israel to the more \nthan 1.8 million residents of Gaza whose Hamas government fought a 50-day \nwar against them this summer. The war cost the lives of a reported 2,000 \nGazans, according to Hamas government figures, and 70 Israelis. Recent \nindependent analysis of the Gazan dead suggests that as many as half were \nterrorist combatants.The success of Israel\u2019s controversial West Bank \nseparation barrier in lowering suicide attacks on the Jewish state by as \nmuch as 90 percent, appears to have not gone unnoticed by Egypt which is \nnow facing a comparable problem from Gaza-based Palestinian terrorists. \nEgypt appears to be weighing a similar solution, although some regional \nexperts believe there may be other alternatives.\u201cI\u2019m not sure they are \ngoing to build a wall,\u201d Zvi Mazel, Israeli Ambassador to Egypt from \n1996-2001, told FoxNews.com. \u201cI understand [Egypt] would like to create a \nbuffer zone where there are no houses and no vegetation.\u201dMazel noted that \nto do so, Egypt would have to expel 100,000 Bedouins from northern Sinai to \nestablish such a zone.Mazel believes the \u201cforeign powers\u201d Al Sisi referred \nto as fomenting attacks launched from Gaza and funding terror operations in \nSinai are Qatar, Turkey and Iran.\u201cHe knows better than anyone else who is \nresponsible for encouraging these terrorists,\u201d Mazel said. \u201cThe terrorists \nin Sinai constitute the threat, but someone is giving them money, and the \nmoney has most likely come from those countries.\u201d\nU.S. mulls Canadian border fence - Politics - CBC News\n\nwww.cbc.ca/news/politics/u-s-mulls-canadian-border-fence-1.1084326\n\n\n\nchersonandmolschky.com/2014/05/18/israel-security-fence\nCulturebreach ...maybe you should reconsider posting your bullshit \nnonsense...you are a hypocrite."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqG5n1TmdxuIY52hHBzYCsw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Culturebreach", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mtxp4lkvzinvu423zhrhjzpudj50tw", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-11T23:27:09.476Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqG5n1TmdxuIY52hHBzYCsw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.659362, "formal_score": 96, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-11T23:27:49.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7GIQKmxmNRo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/Fvz_3yUtHP0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117109013421409383843", "textDisplay": "+RR Sandler \nhttp://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?pr=71&code=mwp&p1=3&p2=4&p3=6\n\n\n- By fourteen votes to one,  \nThe construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in \nthe Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, \nand its associated r\u00e9gime, are contrary to international law\n\n   .

According \nto Eugene Rostow, one of the drafters of 242, the plain meaning of the \nresolution is that Israel's administration of the West bank and Gaza is \ncompletely legal until a just and lasting peace is achieved. Such \nadministration, in the absence of a peace treaty, and in the face of \ncontinued hostility from Arab nations and terrorist groups, can include the \ndevelopment of unoccupied segments of housing a growing population.

Go \nread the Israeli army archives and look for the Minutes of the meetings of \nthe Generals prior to the War. \n\n\n\nYizthak Rabin ( in a interview) - \" The two divisions which he(Nasser) sent \nto the Sinai, on May 14, would not have been sufficient to start an \noffensive against Israel.

You don't strike at the enemy because he is a bastard, \nbut because he threatens you. And the Syrians, on the fourth day of the \nwar, were not a threat to us.''\n\n\nDyan then goes on to explain how most of the hostilities between Israel and \nSyria would break out:\n\n\n\" After all, I know how at least 80 percent of the clashes there started. \nIn my opinion, more than 80 percent,but let's talk about 80 percent. It \nwent this way: We would send a tractor to plow some area where it wasn't \npossible to do anything, in the demilitarized area, and knew in advance \nthat the Syrians would start to shoot. If they didn't shoot, we would tell \nthe tractor to advance farther, until in the end the Syrians would get \nannoyed and shoot. And then we would use artillery and later the air force \nalso, and that's how it was.''\n\n\n\nIsrael did not such thing. It offered no territory exchange for peace. \nNone- whatsoever. \n\n\nSadat wanted the Sinai back in 1971 and offered Israel full peace in \nexchange. Israel refused because it wanted to build in the Sinai. That lead \nto the 1973 war. Sadat has been threatening war months prior to its \noutbreak. Israel was forced to accept the deal with Sadat in 1979 otherwise \nit would have risked another war. \n\n\nYes, because the West Bank and Gaza are not Jordans or Egypts. They are \nPalestinian territories. The majority of countries in the UN recognizes \nthis. \n\n\n\n\nSo like I said, Go read actual history that hasn't been churned out by the \nIsraeli Education system or the Israeli Foreign ministry."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmFSPCc4Dm-lQAtBUTWoPPQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "RR Sandler", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mtxp4lkvzinvu423zhrhjzpudj50tw", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-11T04:02:46.412Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmFSPCc4Dm-lQAtBUTWoPPQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.68046399999999996, "formal_score": 49, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-11T04:02:46.412Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IYSWMDRlhKQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANc/1sCX83RAyhM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106317518021483609223", "textDisplay": "+Culturebreach nonsense...no trials have been in the International Court of \nJustice.

Yes, that's correct!... \n \n  A very smart descision by the Israeli supreme court and the only \nintelligent decision they could make. Israel is obviously located in the \nIslamic authoritarian mideast surrounded by countries and war torn \ncountries and people that want nothing more than Muslim domination over the \nentire area. Same as the Muslims do in the \"No Go Zones\" all over Europe. \nNo one should expect the Jewish homeland to be anything more than a \npluristic democracy with a 'protected' Jewish majority population under \nthese circumstances. \n   The Israeli Arab Muslims, their gays and lesbians, their women and \nchildren should consider themselves very lucky their parents or \ngrandparents signed the pledge of nonviolence with Israel when they were \ngiven the opportunity. To have the chance to grow up in such a modern \nprogressive oasis with equal citizenship rights to the Jewish majority, \nthey are indeed very lucky to live under modern Jewish values of law and \norder, which includes NO capital punishment..... A completely different set \nof values Islam requires for law and order that includes but not limited \nto hanging high up by a crane from the neck, be-headings, be-handings, \nstoned to death, family honor killings or simply shot in the head for \npunishment or whatever else the consequences for being gay, being a women, \nfor being a women rape victim or for petty crimes like alcohol or drug \npossession. A horrific enviroment with terrifying punishment that \ncan only happen in the surrounding countries or on the other side of the \narmistice lines in Gaza or perhaps the West Bank, but NOT in the Jewish \nstate. However imperfect, its the closes thing to perfect that Israel can \nafford and still insure the fate of a Jewish homeland that has ability \nto protect Jews, Jewish culture, traditions and Judaism itself. All sitting \non top the Jewish ancient ruins of kingdoms Israel and Judea. The people \nwho gave the wisdom of monotheism to the world. Respect is past over due \nby ignorant Muslims and the ignorant antisemtic Christians the world over \nwho are to stupid to know that Jesus was born a Jew and died a Jew, his \nparents were Jews. The first Christians were called JEWISH-Christians. To \nbe a Christian and hate Jews is Un-Christian and Un-Godly. \n  \n  The re-creation of Israel was reduced to 20% of the original promised \nland mass by British mandate. Jews excepted UN resolution 181 to partition \nthe remaining 20%, giving statehood to a 2nd Palestinian state (next to the \nfirst one being Jordan) on roughly 10% of that 20%. So Jews went from 100% \nof the land to build a state on, to 20% to roughly 10%. Jews have \ncompromised enough with Arab Muslims! That is for damn sure! \n  The Arabs rejected UN resolution 181 and waged a five Arab country war \nagainst the newly formed Jewish state and LOST. As losers they should \nexcept their lose and except the state of Israels right to exist. They \nshould of been forced by Israel and undoubtedly forced by the Leage of \nNations to absorb all their refugees into their 21 Arab lands and given \ntheir refugees and their descendants equal citizenship rights to \ntheir rightful ancestral Arab lands. The fact this didn't happen, and 65 \nyears later its still not happening and Israels security is still \nconstantly threated and Jews are still dying along with Arab refugees is \nutterly outrageous and insane and a total failure of both Israel's decision \nnot to push them out into  Jordan and the surrounding gulf states. The \ninternational communities decision not to make Arab nations absorb \ntheir refugees. It's ultimately the sick twisted, deprived decision by the \nArab League to perpetuate this war by proxy against Israel for all these \nyears. Those sick bastards!! Palestine doesn't exist because they rejected \nit and have rejected all offers there after. They don't want a 'partition', \nthey want what their ignorant and genocidal chat suggest....\"\"from the \nriver to the sea, Palestine will be free\"\" (another words holocaust \npart2)....These people are fucking deranged lunitics that have rewrote \nhistory and the rest of the antisemitic, ignorant, useful idiots living in \ncountries all over the world \n(including you) have embrassed this LIE and givin it credence and exploted \nit. That includes the Arab block vote UN, a useless organization that \nperpetuates this LIE! Palestine is NOT a state, a nation or anything and it \nnever was but a British held territory from 1920-48. Its a dead UN \nresolution that Arabs ruined by war mongering and it is THEIR \nresponsibility to do right be THEIR refugees. \n\n  Having extremely limited resources at the time, Israel absorbed all the \nJewish refugees exiled from their homes off Muslim lands throughout the \nMideast from 1948-1954.... Its been past time that Arabs did the same with \ntheir refugees and stop this false Palestine nationalism insanity they have \ncreated keeping these people behind 'cease-fire' lines in poverty and ate \nup with ignorant blind hatred for something their own people had done to \nthem for over half a century now.

The leftist bias against Israel is \nastonishing and sickening.\n\n It's easy to point to crude numbers of casualties of both sides to accuse \nIsrael of comitting genocide, when in reality Israel does everything it can \nto protect their civilians while the other side uses the civilians as human \nshields to protect their rockets. \n\nHamas is the real enemy of the palestinian people not Israel."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgxfJhFlFL9XVxJ4J0QF36w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bete Noire", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cu52y3vactz20g22rxxzrgz3lcr31e", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-08T22:47:55.376Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgxfJhFlFL9XVxJ4J0QF36w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.16219, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-08T22:47:55.376Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lkKQGbPTp2w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/MNUnhc-q28c/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117215144720572408068", "textDisplay": "The casus bellum for the Gazan slaughter was supposed rockets fired into \nIsrael.

And that is precisely why the \nICHR report on the anarchy, lawlessness and human rights violations by the \nPalestinian Authority and Hamas will be completely ignored in the West.\nA report issued by the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights \n(ICHR) this week criticized the Palestinian Authority [PA] and Hamas for \nassaults on human rights and freedoms in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nThe report, which has been ignored by mainstream media and human rights \norganizations in the West, reveals that 10 Palestinians died in January \n2014 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a result of anarchy, lawlessness \nand misuse of weapons.\nThe report also lists cases of torture and mistreatment in PA and Hamas \nprisons. ICHR pointed to an increase in the number of torture cases in \nprisons belonging to the PA's much-feared Preventive Security Service in \nthe West Bank.\nDuring January, ICHR wrote that it received 56 complaints about torture and \nmistreatment in Palestinian prisons: 36 in the Gaza Strip and 19 in the \nWest Bank. In addition, the human rights organization received innumerable \ncomplaints about arbitrary and unlawful arrests of Palestinians by the PA \nand Hamas.\n\nA Palestinian Authority policeman attacks protestors. (Image source: \n\"Palestinians for Dignity\" Facebook Page)\n\nICHR wrote that it also received complaints from Palestinians who accused \nthe Palestinian Authority security forces in the West Bank of unlawfully \nseizing their money.\nThe organization also received complaints about assaults on freedom of \nexpression and the media, as well as on peaceful protests and academic \nfreedoms.\nOf the 10 Palestinians who died during January, the report found that half \nof them died as a result of violent disputes between clans. One Palestinian \nwas killed while working in a smuggling tunnel along the border between the \nGaza Strip and Egypt. Three Palestinians died in what the organization \ndescribes as cases of \"security anarchy and misuse of weapons.\" In the Gaza \nStrip, the report said, a 13-year-old girl named Wisam Ashour committed \nsuicide by hanging herself in her family home.\nWith regards to torture, the organization stated that it received \ncomplaints from Palestinians who said they had been tortured while in \ndetention in Palestinian Authority and Hamas prisons.\nICHR related that it received 85 complaints during January concerning \nunlawful and arbitrary arrests by the two Palestinian governments. Many \ndetainees said they were taken into custody for \"politically-motivated\" \noffenses.\nAs for assaults on freedom of expression and peaceful protests, the human \nrights organization pointed out that on January 12, 2014, PA policemen used \nforce to break up a protest by Palestinian youths north of Ramallah. \nBetween 60-70 protesters, the report continued, were wounded in the head \nand legs after policemen attacked them with clubs and stun grenades.\nOn January 28, 2014, Palestinian Authority policemen used live ammunition \nto disperse stone-throwers in the center of Ramallah, according to the \nreport. It also stated that there was no reason for the use of live \nammunition during the incident. Four protesters were wounded, the report \ndocumented, when policemen attacked them with clubs.\nDuring the last week of January, the report noted, Hamas security forces \nraided two university campuses in the Gaza Strip and used excessive force \nto disperse student protests against high tuition.\nIn the West Bank, the Preventive Security Service summoned for \ninterrogation a number of students suspected of involvement in political \nactivities, and, the report revealed, a University in Jericho expelled a \nstudent on suspicion that his brother and cousin belonged to Hamas.\nReferring to anarchy and lawlessness in the West Bank, the human rights \norganization pointed to an incident that took place near Hebron on January \n18. On that day, more than 100 men attacked the building of the Yatta \nMunicipality, using a bulldozer to force their way inside.\nMayor Musa Makhamarah said the assailants were relatives and friends of a \nmunicipal council who had been dismissed from his job. The mayor complained \nthat although he had warned the Palestinian Authority police in advance \nabout the possibility of such an attack, no police reinforcements were \ndispatched to the scene.\nThe report found that the Palestinian Authority was continuing to ignore \ncourt rulings. The Preventive Security Service and the General Intelligence \nForce regularly ignore orders issued by various courts to release \nPalestinian detainees, it pointed out, listing seven cases that occurred \nlast month.\nEarlier last week, representatives of ICHR met with PA Interior Minister \nSaid Abu Ali and discussed with him cases of torture and human rights \nviolations in the West Bank. They also discussed the continued security \ncrackdown on Palestinian students at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. \nMany students have complained that they were being targeted for \"political \nreasons\" by various branches of the Palestinian security establishment.\nThe report's findings once again show that neither the Palestinian \nAuthority nor Hamas respect human rights and freedom of expression in the \nterritories under their control.\nThat Hamas is responsible for human rights violations and assaults on \nfreedom of expression should not come as a surprise to anyone.\nBut what is surprising is that the Palestinian Authority leadership, which \noften boasts that Palestinians living under its jurisdiction enjoy freedom \nof expression and democracy, is continuing to lie not only to its \nconstituents, but also to the Western media and international donors about \nits human rights record.\nThe PA has been successful in diverting attention from these problems by \nputting all the blame on Israel.

The U.S. underwrites some of Israel's \nresearch and development of weapons, and has contributed significant \namounts of money to Israeli defense projects such as the Merkava main \nbattle tank and the IAI Lavi ground-attack aircraft. Israel is a \nparticipant in the F-35 Lightning II fighter development program and was \noffered access to the F-22 Raptor program, though it turned this down due \nto the high costs.[3]The U.S. and Israel also cooperate jointly on a number \nof technology development programs, notably the Arrow missile system and \nthe Tactical High Energy Laser (also known as Nautilus).[3] The two \ncountries carry out regular exercises together, including carrying out \nbiennial exercises codenamed Juniper Cobra intended to test \ninteroperability between the two militaries. In addition, the Israeli port \nof Haifa is the main port of call in the eastern Mediterranean for the \nUnited States Sixth Fleet, and Israel provides other logistical and \nmaintenance support for U.S. forces in the region.[2] The two countries \nalso share intelligence and maintain a joint anti-terrorist working \ngroup,[3] and in April 2007 their air forces committed to share information \nabout mutually relevant procurements.[14]The United States has stored \nmilitary equipment in Israel since the early 1990s and may store additional \nequipment in Israel when withdrawing from Iraq.[15]Currently the only \nactive foreign military installation on Israeli soil is the American \nAN/TPY-2 early missile warning radar station on Mt. Keren.[16]In October \n2012, United States and Israel began their biggest joint air and missile \ndefense exercise, known as Austere Challenge 12, involving around 3,500 \nU.S. troops in the region along with 1,000 IDF personnel.[17] Germany and \nBritain also participated.[18]Almost all of the yearly monetary assistance \nfor defense given to Israel is used spent on American contractors.

My general observations of Senator Sanders responding to a \nquestion is that he not only provides his opinion, but the reasons for that \nopinion based on his own personal knowledge. He is not a sound bite guy. He \nis a statesman who is accustomed to respectful and factual dialogue. I am a \ncommunity activist myself and have attended many actions in support of the \nissues of most importance to me. In my experience, shouting down the people \nat the podium before they've had a chance to answer the question they've \nbeen asked does nothing to move the issue at hand in the desired direction. \nBernie's reported \"emotional\" response was clearly spurred by the \ndisrespectful and unnecessary interruptions by the activists. Sad that \ntheir emotional state brought what could very well have been a constructive \ndialogue to an abrupt end. I would have appreciated an opportunity to hear \ndirectly from Senator Sanders' regarding his stance on this very serious \nissue. The best thing I learned from it is how important it is that we \nactivists wait until we hear the full response before we give them the \n\"what for\". Those actions usually take a lot of time and effort to get \norganized and I like to make sure we get the most out of them when we put \nthem into action.

Subscribe to \u201cIsrael Today.\u201dThe sheikh\u2019s \nwords caused a storm in the Arab media, and were picked up by the Israeli \nEmbassy in Amman.The Arabic daily Al-Quds Al-Arabi further explained the \nsheikh\u2019s position, noting that he supports the notion that Jordan is \nPalestine, and insists that Arabs living both in Jordan and the Palestinian \nAuthority-controlled territories would almost all love to be Israeli \ncitizens.The Adwan tribe issued a statement distancing itself from Sheikh \nAladoan\u2019s remarks. But the sheikh was not intimidated, and insisted he \nwould continue to make his voice heard on these matters.\n\n                Last year, Sheikh Aladoan visited Israel and spent time \nwith the chief rabbi of Tsfat (Safed), Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu. The sheikh \ninformed Rabbi Eliyahu and his students that in the Koran, \u201cthere is no \nname \u2018Palestine\u2019 for this land, and therefore, the Arabs should not be \nfighting the Jews over control of this land.\u201d"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgtXYoDYLgsgid9jdxlXfdw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Astraea Shaw", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133zxvyaractbbwy04cinkigo2bxrwboxg0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-19T11:22:12.686Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgtXYoDYLgsgid9jdxlXfdw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.92853589999999997, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-19T11:22:12.686Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109197245420498364331", "textDisplay": "+RR Sandler The whole Nobel business is fake and corrupt.

Regardless, the full story wasn't presented. Here \nis an excerpt of the exchange:\n\n*[Constituent] Are you going to go further\u2026 [and end] $30 billion going to \nIsrael over the next ten years?*\n\n*[Sanders:] You have a situation where Hamas is sending missiles into \nIsrael\u2026 and you know where some of those missiles are coming from? They\u2019re \ncoming from populated areas\u2026 Hamas has very sophisticated tunnels into \nIsrael for military purposes.*\n\n*[Constituent:] Gazans have a right to resist.*\n\n*[Sanders:] Excuse me, shut up! You don\u2019t have the microphone.*\n\n*[Constituent:] You\u2019re going to arrest people?*\n\n*[Constituent:] Occupied populations have the right to resist.*\n\n*[Sanders:] You have a right to your view\u2026 Hamas is very clear: their view \nis that Israel should not have a right to exist.*\n\n*[Constituent:] Bullshit! .. Fuck Israel!*\n\n*[Sanders:] Furthermore, the issue of Gaza is not the only issue right now \nin that region As some of you may have noticed\u2026 There\u2019s a group called \nISIS. Do you know what ISIS is?*\n\n*[Constituent, sarcastic:] Yeah!*\n\n*[Sanders:] Excuse me ISIS is a group receiving money from aorund the world \nthat wants to convert parts of Iraq and Syria into a 7th century calipate. \nYou know what women\u2019s rights are in that area? They are below\u2013 [tumult] \nNobody wants to listen, they can leave\u2026 So you have a situation right now \nwhere we are figuring out in that region how you deal with people who have \ntens of thousands of very armed and aggressive people who may be making \nsignificant gains in that area. The point you make, I agree, I share your \nconcerns about Israeli overreaction\u2026 I believe in a two-state solution. I \nwould hope that the U.S. in a very very difficult situation, where the \nleadership on both sides is not particularly good, can finally work out a \nsituation where Israel has a right to exist in security, and at the same \ntime the Palestinians have a state of their own.*\n\n*[Constituent:] It\u2019s not going to happen.*\n\n*[Sanders:] I have been working on it for the last 50 years. I\u2019m sorry, I \ndon\u2019t have the magic answer. This is a very depressing and difficult issue. \nThis has gone on for 60 bloody years, year after year\u2026 If you\u2019re asking me \nif I have the magical solution, I don\u2019t, and you know what, I doubt very \nmuch that you do!*\n\n[Source: http://mondoweiss.net/2015/05/sanders-leftwing-economic]\n\nWhat's more telling are the statements of the constituents. What does that \nperson want? Are their arguments simply to criticize Israel's aggressive \npolicies, or are they anti-Zionist and want to abolish the State of Israel \nin its entirety? I'm inclined to believe the latter. Sanders later \nreaffirmed his position of a two-state solution in the meeting, so it's \nobvious that his views are not as \"neoconservative\" as Kyle Kulinski of \n would like to think. Perhaps if he didn't cut the video before it got to \nthat part, he would realize that.\n\nAlthough Sanders' use of vapid talking points and deflections does not help \nhis case, the hecklers are mostly to blame for this incident. Perhaps if he \nwas given the opportunity to fully articulate his views without the \nharassment of some belligerent protesters, it might have turned out \ndifferently. Nevertheless, Sanders made some valid points about Hamas. He \nshouldn't have prefaced his argument with criticizing Hamas' actions, \nthough. That would probably just lead to misunderstanding, and I suspect \nthat's exactly what occurred.\n\nAs for Kyle's points? I generally agree, though I think he could have done \na much better job articulating his criticisms of Sanders' statements\u2014one \nthat didn't involve conveniently ignoring the rest of the video. Moreover, \ndescribing Sanders' reaction as explosive is hyperbolic and I would say \nthat Kyle \"exploded\" even more than Sanders did, only Kyle didn't have \nhecklers interrupting his speech.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMrTOxM__8ACwRnPanbUg9w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "John Dodge", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ejhdrjraghpnfe22eyrqwpqziibt0l", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-12T01:46:00.322Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMrTOxM__8ACwRnPanbUg9w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.33308000000000004, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-12T01:46:00.322Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113137549770931279973", "textDisplay": "+Bill Chizzz\nThat reality is so OLD it's hard to believe hardly anyone admits it.

But yes, I do believe that religious communities do not \nneed to own the land they consider religiously significant for its \nreligious significance and function to be recognized and exercised. The \nproblem is when that land is owned by an opposing force or another \nreligious group that conflicts with one's religion\u2014when infidels or \nheathens or nonbelievers own the land your religion covets. That's why\n\nI think the ownership of Jerusalem by any religious body is a matter if \nserious concern, and why I think it would be better for it to be ownerless \n(or owned by the international community). Just because Jerusalem is not \nowned by Jews (or anyone), though, that does not preclude the existence of \nIsrael. Like I said, the state of Israel can still exist without possessing \nlegal ownership over Israel. I support a two-state solution, with \nlegitimate states for both Israel and Palestine, but I believe Jerusalem \nshould ideally be an international zone.\n\nWith Jerusalem being in no particular religion's control, all three \nAbrahamic religions can coexist and share Jerusalem as equal factions. At \nthis time, Israel owns Jerusalem, which gives the Jewish faction in \nJerusalem hegemony and power over the Islamic and Christian factions. I \nthink this is unfair and dangerous, not to mention an active cause in \nincreased tensions in the region. If Jerusalem was an international zone, \nMuslims in particular (but also Christians) would not have to fear \npersecution and oppression by a religious government that does not \nrepresent\u2014or is hostile to\u2014their religious faith.

However, while recognizing that Israel has the \nright to defend itself, he also strongly condemned Israeli attacks on Gaza \nas disproportionate and the widespread killing of civilians as completely \nunacceptable.The U.S. must play a leading role in creating a two-state \nsolution, which will require significant compromises from both sides.

Owning the second largest private company in America is, \napparently, not good enough.  It doesn\u2019t appear that they will be satisfied \nuntil they are able to control the entire political process.\n\nIt is well known that the Koch brothers have provided the major source of \nfunding to the Tea Party and want to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDavid KochWhat else do the Koch brothers want?\n\nIn 1980, David Koch ran as the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice-presidential \ncandidate in 1980. \n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the 1980 Libertarian Party platform. \n\nHere are just a few excerpts of the Libertarian Party platform that David \nKoch ran on in 1980:\n\n\u201cWe urge the repeal of federal campaign finance laws, and the immediate \nabolition of the despotic Federal Election Commission.\u201d\n\u201cWe favor the abolition of Medicare and Medicaid programs.\u201d\n\u201cWe oppose any compulsory insurance or tax-supported plan to provide health \nservices, including those which finance abortion services.\u201d\n\u201cWe also favor the deregulation of the medical insurance industry.\u201d\n\u201cWe favor the repeal of the fraudulent, virtually bankrupt, and \nincreasingly oppressive Social Security system. Pending that repeal, \nparticipation in Social Security should be made voluntary.\u201d\n\u201cWe propose the abolition of the governmental Postal Service. The present \nsystem, in addition to being inefficient, encourages governmental \nsurveillance of private correspondence.  Pending abolition, we call for an \nend to the monopoly system and for allowing free competition in all aspects \nof postal service.\u201d\n\u201cWe oppose all personal and corporate income taxation, including capital \ngains taxes.\u201d\n\u201cWe support the eventual repeal of all taxation.\u201d\n\u201cAs an interim measure, all criminal and civil sanctions against tax \nevasion should be terminated immediately.\u201d\n\u201cWe support repeal of all law which impede the ability of any person to \nfind employment, such as minimum wage laws.\u201d\n\u201cWe advocate the complete separation of education and State.  Government \nschools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free \nchoice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and \nsubsidy of schools and colleges should be ended.\u201d\n\u201cWe condemn compulsory education laws \u2026 and we call for the immediate \nrepeal of such laws.\u201d\n\u201cWe support the repeal of all taxes on the income or property of private \nschools, whether profit or non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWe support the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency.\u201d\n\u201cWe support abolition of the Department of Energy.\u201d\n\u201cWe call for the dissolution of all government agencies concerned with \ntransportation, including the Department of Transportation.\u201d\n\u201cWe demand the return of America's railroad system to private ownership. We \ncall for the privatization of the public roads and national highway system.\u201d\n\u201cWe specifically oppose laws requiring an individual to buy or use \nso-called \"self-protection\" equipment such as safety belts, air bags, or \ncrash helmets.\u201d\n\u201cWe advocate the abolition of the Federal Aviation Administration.\u201d\n\u201cWe advocate the abolition of the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d\n\u201cWe support an end to all subsidies for child-bearing built into our \npresent laws, including all welfare plans and the provision of \ntax-supported services for children.\u201d\n\u201cWe oppose all government welfare, relief projects, and \u2018aid to the poor\u2019 \nprograms. All these government programs are privacy-invading, \npaternalistic, demeaning, and inefficient. The proper source of help for \nsuch persons is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals.\u201d\n\u201cWe call for the privatization of the inland waterways, and of the \ndistribution system that brings water to industry, agriculture and \nhouseholds.\u201d\n\u201cWe call for the repeal of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.\u201d\n\u201cWe call for the abolition of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\u201d\n\u201cWe support the repeal of all state usury laws.\u201d\nIn other words, the agenda of the Koch brothers is not only to defund \nObamacare.  The agenda of the Koch brothers is to repeal every major piece \nof legislation that has been signed into law over the past 80 years that \nhas protected the middle class, the elderly, the children, the sick, and \nthe most vulnerable in this country.\n\nIt is clear that the Koch brothers and other right wing billionaires are \ncalling the shots and are pulling the strings of the Republican Party. \n\nAnd because of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, they \nnow have the power to spend an unlimited amount of money to buy the House \nof Representatives, the Senate, and the next President of the United States.\n\nIf they are allowed to hijack the American political process to defund \nObamacare they will be back for more. \n\nTomorrow it will be Social Security, ending Medicare as we know it, \nrepealing the minimum wage.  It seems to me that the Koch brothers will not \nbe content until they get everything they believe they are entitled to.\n\nOur great nation can no longer be hijacked by right-wing billionaires like \nthe Koch brothers.\n\nFor the sake of our children and our grandchildren, for the sake of our \neconomy, we have got to let democracy\" "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCep65GLnsWQnD9OEU8lZ1zQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "kmart67620", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z132u1fbetfvsxdxi04ci3hb4ymwdzozoo40k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-18T16:01:22.491Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCep65GLnsWQnD9OEU8lZ1zQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.30619599999999997, "formal_score": 39, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-18T16:01:22.491Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108676285881887158353", "textDisplay": "+Harry Flashman \"dude - who runs the country though?

The area that \nis now Israel, when it was under British rule, was kind of a mish-mosh \nrefugee area with lots of different groups from the surrounding countries. \nWhat we call the Palestinian people are from various countries in the \nOttoman Empire who were not welcomed by their new governments after the \nEmpire's fall in WWI. When Israel became a state in the 40s, it establisbed \nitself as the only Jewish country surrounded by Muslim countries. It's the \nonly area they had where they could be free from prosecution, so I think \nit's right that they have that tiny little country. \n\nHowever, it doesn't seem reasonable to place the responsibility of the \nPalestinian people on Israel. Of course they should have their own state \nand govern themselves, but why should it come from what little space Israel \nhas already? Most Palestinians have recent ancestry in Syria, Saudi Arabia, \nAfghanistan, etc., so why shouldn't they create a space for the \nPalestinians? Considering the space available for them, as well as their \nsimilar religious views and social structure, carving a bit of Saudi Arabia \nout for Palestine would make all kinds of sense. Of course, it's unlikely \nthat any of those countries would accept those terms, but I still don't \nthink it's Israel's responsibility to host them. \n\nAlso, about the tunnels issue, Israel has been providing most of the aid \nfor Gaza, including the food and building materials you mentioned. The \ntunnels were mostly used for warfare, not for the transportation of these \ngoods.

Senator Sanders strongly \ncondemned indiscriminate rocket fire by Hamas into Israeli territory, and \nHamas\u2019 use of civilian neighborhoods to launch those attacks. However, \nwhile recognizing that Israel has the right to defend itself, he also \nstrongly condemned Israeli attacks on Gaza as disproportionate and the \nwidespread killing of civilians as completely unacceptable.The U.S. must \nplay a leading role in creating a two-state solution, which will require \nsignificant compromises from both sides. The Palestinians must \nunequivocally recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, and hold accountable those \nwho have committed terrorist acts. The Israelis must end the blockade of \nGaza, and cease developing settlements on Palestinian land. Both sides must \nnegotiate in good faith regarding all other outstanding issues that stand \nin the way of a durable and lasting peace in the region. In the meantime, \nstrict adherence, by all sides, to the tenets of international humanitarian \nlaw is necessary in order to avoid escalating the conflict yet again. \nhttps://berniesanders.com/issues/war-and-peace/"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2nF9iUCGeWr8n_xoiUhwlg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Brenda Schouten-Beckett", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ke1fzxlbdfh2aj04cdzxbkr2jhdqhh3k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-11T16:03:33.620Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC2nF9iUCGeWr8n_xoiUhwlg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.54265000000000008, "formal_score": 24, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-11T16:03:33.620Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_ZW94bi_rqs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACo0/ltglGWtkJJQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111112634798711868997", "textDisplay": "+Brandon Holland all 8 of your followers will be disappointed when they do \nnot see any more of your inane comments on my streams.

Fire not intended to attack the \nenemy, such as negligent discharge and deliberate firing on one's own \ntroops for disciplinary reasons, is not called friendly fire. Nor is \nunintentional harm to non-combatants or structures, which is sometimes \nreferred to as collateral damage.Use of the term \"friendly\" in a military \ncontext for allied personnel or materiel dates from the First World War, \noften for shells falling short] The term friendly fire was originally \nadopted by the United States military. Many North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO) militaries refer to these incidents as blue on blue, \nwhich derives from military exercises where NATO forces were identified by \nblue pennants and units representing Warsaw Pact forces by orange pennants.\n\n\nAddressing friendly fireFriendly fire is often seen as an inescapable \nresult of combat, and because it only accounts for a small percentage of \ncasualties, can often be dismissed as irrelevant to the outcome of a \nbattle. The effects of friendly fire, however, are not just material. \nTroops expect to be targeted by the enemy, but being hit by their own \nforces has a huge negative impact. In the Tarnak Farm incident, four \nCanadian soldiers were killed and eight others injured when a U.S. Air \nNational Guard Major dropped a 500 lb (230 kg) bomb from his F-16 onto the \nPrincess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry regiment which was conducting a \nnight firing exercise near Kandahar. Another case of such an accident was \nthe death of Pat Tillman in Afghanistan, although the exact circumstances \nof that incident are yet to be definitively determined.During World War II, \n\"invasion stripes\" were painted on Allied aircraft to assist identification \nin preparation for the invasion of Normandy. Similar markings had been used \nwhen the Hawker Typhoon was first introduced into use as it was otherwise \nvery similar in profile to a German aircraft. Late in the war the \n\"protection squadron\" that covered the elite German jet fighter squadron as \nit landed or took off were brightly painted to distinguish them from \nraiding Allied fighters.A number of situations can lead to or exacerbate \nthe risk of friendly fire. Poor terrain and visibility are major factors. \nSoldiers fighting on unfamiliar ground can become disoriented more easily \nthan on familiar terrain. The direction from which enemy fire comes may not \nbe easy to identify, and poor weather conditions and combat stress may add \nto the confusion, especially if fire is exchanged. Accurate navigation and \nfire discipline are vital. In high-risk situations, leaders need to ensure \nunits are properly informed of the location of friendly units and to issue \nclear, unambiguous orders, but they must also react correctly to responses \nfrom soldiers who are capable of using their own judgement. \nMiscommunication can be deadly. Radios, field telephones, and signalling \nsystems can be used to address the problem, but when these systems are used \nto co-ordinate multiple forces such as ground troops and aircraft, their \nbreakdown can dramatically increase the risk of friendly fire. When allied \ntroops are operating the situation is even more complex, especially with \nlanguage barriers to overcome.\"\n\nwww.sodahead.com/united-states/uss-liberty---the-truth/blog-246997"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_q0YSauD9bAyzdLG25FGKQ", "inappropriate_score": 4.4444444444444446, "authorDisplayName": "Borris Morris", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12vsffj0ritgbzkc22pujfj3kz2z5bu1", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-05T23:56:49.866Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_q0YSauD9bAyzdLG25FGKQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99410443000000004, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-05T23:56:49.866Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hUPslg0A4Q0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACA/zkWo_JzvwAc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104886741047459511385", "textDisplay": "+RR Sandler you actually believe that.

Liberty. \nThis episode, which occurred on June 8, left 34 Americans dead and 171 \nwounded, was immediately acknowledged by Israeli authorities as a ghastly \nmistake; a multitude of Israeli and American inquiries then confirmed that \nan error lay at the heart of the tragedy. But conspiracy theories pointing \nto a purposeful Israeli attack arose quickly and have persisted through the \nyears, promoted in part by members of the Liberty's crew.Cristol\u2014a former \nU.S. naval aviator himself and presently a federal judge in Florida\u2014has \ndevoted fourteen years to ascertain what actually happened in the \nMediterranean Sea off the Egyptian coast that day. His research is \nstunningly complete, tracking down what appears to be every available \ndocument and living participant in the drama, plus providing a great deal \nof contextual information. He reviews the issue in such great detail that \nit takes seven pages just to deal with the question of the U.S. flag flying \non the Liberty (could the pilots have seen it? given the day's winds, how \nvisible was it? what about the possibility of it being a false \nflag?).Cristol finds fault on both the Israeli and American sides (the \nlatter, for example, failed to inform the Israelis of the ship's presence) \nbut comes to an unambiguous conclusion: the attack was indeed a mistake. \nAfter showing the impossibility of an intentional Israeli bombing, he then \nproceeds to show the absurdity of the conspiracy theories. (My favorite of \nthem, from an Egyptian ambassador named Mahmud Qasim: the Israelis spliced \nthe voice of Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser to have him convince Jordan's King \nHusayn into going to war against Israel \u2013 then tried to cover up this trick \nby attacking the Liberty, a spy ship capable of figuring out the \ndeception.) After demolishing these false notions, Cristol offers a \ngenerous interpretation to his vanquished opponents: \"The Liberty incident \nis a classic illustration of the terrible results that can occur when \nfriendly forces fail to keep their friends informed of their \nmovements.\"Jan. 2, 2003 update: A. Jay Cristol replied to his critics on \nthis site with the following comments:The negative user comments posted in \nresponse to the Daniel Pipes review of my book The Liberty Incident have \none thing in common. They all are from persons who have their minds made up \nand are not interested in learning new facts; further, it appears most have \nnot read the book. If after you read the book and visit my website and then \ndisagree with my conclusion that the attack was a tragic mistake, it is a \nfree country. You should know that the conclusion of tragic mistake is not \nmine alone.The U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry convened just days after the \nevent made 52 findings of fact. Three of the most important findings are:1. \nAvailable evidence combines to indicate the attack on Liberty on 8 June was \nin fact a case of mistaken identity,2. The calm conditions and slow ship \nspeed may well have made the American flag difficult to identify, and3. \nThere are no available indications that the attack was intended against a \nU.S. ship.The 727 page record, including 155 pages of sworn testimony by \nthe commanding officer of the ship, William McGonagle, and other Liberty \ncrew members, may be obtained from the Navy Judge Advocate General. Admiral \nJohn McCain, the Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Naval Forces Europe (and father \nof Senator McCain), endorsed the Court of Inquiry:The foregoing comments by \nthe convening authority lead to an overall conclusion that the attack was \nin fact a mistake.The Central Intelligence Agency in a letter from its \ndirector to a United States Senator dated February 27, 1978 stated the \nposition of the CIA:It remains our best judgment that the Israeli attack on \nthe USS Liberty was not made in malice toward the United States and was a \nmistake.Clark Clifford, Chair of the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, reported to the PresidentInformation thus far available \ndoes not reflect that the Israeli High Command made a premeditated attack \non a ship known to be American.Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara \ntestified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1967 that there \nwasNo evidence that the individuals attacking ... knew they were attacking \na U.S. ship.In 1981, the National Security Agency blamed Israeli \nmiscalculations and American communications failures for the tragedy. Eight \nU.S. Presidents, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton and \nBush, have all agreed that the Liberty incident was a tragic case of \nmistaken identity.\""}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC80tZdUYlIQUDJwtw1WSQpg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "se7ensnakes", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12vsffj0ritgbzkc22pujfj3kz2z5bu1", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-05T22:45:57.744Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC80tZdUYlIQUDJwtw1WSQpg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.53454599999999997, "formal_score": 20, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-05T22:45:57.744Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Q4UafSCgkvY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC8/gL9mi3tGmQk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100012287013593622941", "textDisplay": "+RR Sandler According to a 1981 NSA report on the incident, the El Quseir \n\"was approximately one-quarter of the Liberty's tonnage, about one-half its \nlength, and offered a radically different silhouette.\"\n\nFifteen years after the attack, an Israeli pilot approached Liberty \nsurvivors and then held extensive interviews with former Congressman Paul \nN.

By \nthe way: Background \n\nOn June 8, 1967, during the Six Day War, Israeli war planes and torpedo \nboats attacked the USS Liberty, an intelligence gathering ship, while it \nwas on a surveillance mission off the shores of El Arish, in the Sinai \nPeninsula. 34 Americans died and 171 were injured. Israel claimed it \nmistook the Liberty for an enemy vessel. Several Israeli and U.S. \ninvestigations corroborated that claim. \n\nIn 1999, moreover, a National Security Agency report from 1981 was released \nclaiming that \"the tragedy resulted not only from Israeli miscalculation \nbut also from faulty U.S. communications practices.\" Since July 2003, this \nreport has been available on the NSA Web site accompanied by a recording of \nradio communications between Israeli pilots made by a U.S. spy plane on the \nscene throughout the episode. \n\nThe NSA report and other documents declassified since the incident - \nincluding a trove of government materials released in January 2004 - \nsupport findings that the bombing was a case of mistaken identity. Some of \nthe different investigations and their conclusions are listed below. \n\nThe most thorough non-governmental treatment of the bombing is A. Jay \nCristol's The Liberty Incident (2002). Cristol, a U.S. bankruptcy judge and \nformer U.S. Navy lawyer, concludes that \"the totality of evidence \nestablishes that the attack on the USS Liberty was a tragic case of \nmistaken identity that resulted from a compounding of bad mistakes \nperpetrated by both the United States and Israel, and nothing more.\" He \nanalyzes, and meticulously debunks, previous books, articles and TV \nproductions that argue that the attack was intentional and government \ninvestigations only cover-ups.

Moreover, the failure to \nresolve that crisis has helped fuel other conflicts in the region. Senator \nSanders has long supported a two-state solution that recognizes Israel\u2019s \nright to exist in peace and security, and the Palestinians right to a \nhomeland in which they control their political and economic future.The most \nrecent violence in Gaza represented a particularly ugly and violent time in \nthe dispute. Senator Sanders strongly condemned indiscriminate rocket fire \nby Hamas into Israeli territory, and Hamas\u2019 use of civilian neighborhoods \nto launch those attacks. However, while recognizing that Israel has the \nright to defend itself, he also strongly condemned Israeli attacks on Gaza \nas disproportionate and the widespread killing of civilians as completely \nunacceptable.The U.S. must play a leading role in creating a two-state \nsolution, which will require significant compromises from both sides. The \nPalestinians must unequivocally recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, and hold \naccountable those who have committed terrorist acts. The Israelis must end \nthe blockade of Gaza, and cease developing settlements on Palestinian land. \nBoth sides must negotiate in good faith regarding all other outstanding \nissues that stand in the way of a durable and lasting peace in the region. \nIn the meantime, strict adherence, by all sides, to the tenets of \ninternational humanitarian law is necessary in order to avoid escalating \nthe conflict yet again.           \nhttps://berniesanders.com/issues/war-and-peace/"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmFSPCc4Dm-lQAtBUTWoPPQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "RR Sandler", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133vvpberb3wv5j104cifcj2tm4zh15450", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-21T02:19:45.134Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmFSPCc4Dm-lQAtBUTWoPPQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.28167800000000004, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-21T02:19:45.134Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IYSWMDRlhKQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANc/1sCX83RAyhM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106317518021483609223", "textDisplay": "+Jake Smith Funny how you didn't read your own \"sources.\" LOLOLOLOL.

Moreover, the failure to \nresolve that crisis has helped fuel other conflicts in the region. Senator \nSanders has long supported a two-state solution that recognizes Israel\u2019s \nright to exist in peace and security, and the Palestinians right to a \nhomeland in which they control their political and economic future.The most \nrecent violence in Gaza represented a particularly ugly and violent time in \nthe dispute. Senator Sanders strongly condemned indiscriminate rocket fire \nby Hamas into Israeli territory, and Hamas\u2019 use of civilian neighborhoods \nto launch those attacks. However, while recognizing that Israel has the \nright to defend itself, he also strongly condemned Israeli attacks on Gaza \nas disproportionate and the widespread killing of civilians as completely \nunacceptable.The U.S. must play a leading role in creating a two-state \nsolution, which will require significant compromises from both sides. The \nPalestinians must unequivocally recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, and hold \naccountable those who have committed terrorist acts. The Israelis must end \nthe blockade of Gaza, and cease developing settlements on Palestinian land. \nBoth sides must negotiate in good faith regarding all other outstanding \nissues that stand in the way of a durable and lasting peace in the region. \nIn the meantime, strict adherence, by all sides, to the tenets of \ninternational humanitarian law is necessary in order to avoid escalating \nthe conflict yet again."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx3ller7D7rEGoH-jvPD7ng", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Alexander Platypus", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13efzez1uyvxmb0kl2lfbpotyehuex0", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-24T03:57:20.934Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCx3ller7D7rEGoH-jvPD7ng"}, "sentiment_score": -0.20881400000000006, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-24T03:57:20.934Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104524822094611891735", "textDisplay": "+JoAnne Syphus ???

Get your head out of the sand.From \nWikipedia, the free encyclopedia      \n   Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Israel have \ngenerally been seen as one of the most advanced in the Middle East and \nAsia. Same-sex sexual activity was legalized in 1988, although the former \nlaw against buggery had not been enforced since a court decision of 1963. \nIsrael became the first in Asia to recognize unregistered cohabitation \nbetween same-sex couples, making it the only country in Asia to recognize \nany same-sex union thus far. Although same-sex marriages are not performed \nin the country, Israel recognizes same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, \nmaking it the first and only country in Asia to do so. Discrimination on \nthe grounds of sexual orientation was prohibited in 1992. Same-sex couples \nare allowed to jointly adopt after a court decision in 2008, while \npreviously allowing stepchild adoptions and limited co-guardianship rights \nfor non-biological parents. Gays and lesbians are also allowed to serve \nopenly in the military.Recent polls have indicated that a majority of \nIsraelis support same-sex marriage, despite some social conservatism.

But a new organization is mobilizing support \nfor Israel among legislators and members of parliaments around the globe.\nI met MP Dr.Kenneth Meshoe, who is pastor of a South African church, at the \nBudapest International Chairman\u2019s Conference Hosted by the \nPentecostal-Charismatic Faith Church Hungary (Hit Gy\u00fclekezet), the largest \nevangelical church in Europe. Rev. Meshoe is founder and president of the \nAfrican Christian Democratic Party since 1993 and a member of the South \nAfrican Parliament.\nOne church rally in Budapest was a sign of a more visible and passionate \nsupport for Israel among some people in Europe and other parts of the world.\nAt the rally, pro-Israel parliamentarians joined more than 12,000 people at \nFaith Church. A new organization, called the International Israel Allies \nCaucus Foundation, is working to transform that passion into legislative \naction. In cooperation with Faith Church, they brought together the heads \nof its caucuses from around the world to Budapest.\n\n(Copyright: Karl Pfeifer)\nKarl Pfeifer: Reverend, you lived during apartheid in South Africa\u2026\nMP Dr. Kenneth Meshoe: Correct.\nWhat do you feel when you hear Israel being accused of being an apartheid \nstate?\n\nFirstly they are exposing their ignorance. They do not know what apartheid \nwas; they do not know how negatively apartheid impacted on black South \nAfricans. Apartheid was based on the colour of our skin. Because we are not \nwhite we had a law that said we [were] second-class citizens and we [were] \ndenied basic human rights. Now it doesn\u2019t make sense to try to bring up the \nissue of apartheid in a country like Israel because to my notice there is \nno law that discriminates against people on the basis of their colour and \nalso there is no law that discriminates against people on the basis of \ntheir religion.\nThe second statement I can make, those who accuse Israel of being an \napartheid State are minimising the pain of apartheid. In Israel I have not \nseen and I have not noticed Palestinians going through the discrimination \nthat we have come through in South Africa.\n\nCan you give me an example?\nFirstly there were separate modes of transportation for blacks and whites, \nthere were buses only for black people and buses only for white people and \nthere were coaches in trains only for black people and others only for \nwhite people. Sometimes you could see the coach of the black people \noverflowing with passengers and in the coach of white people there were \nonly four or five passengers. The overflow of black people was never \nallowed to go into the white coach. It would be a crime to do so and you \nwould be arrested on the spot if you went to the coach for white people \nthat was meant only for white people. In the public space there were signs \nclearly marked and written \u201cWhites only\u201d and \u201cNon whites\u201d was for the black \npeople. There were chairs and benches in the city parks on all of them \nwritten \u201cWhites only\u201d. There were beaches where black people never set \ntheir foot I am not talking about swimming, just setting the foot. If you \ngo near the place you were arrested, because those beaches were meant only \nfor white people.\nHow can you explain that there are people in the ANC who declare that \nIsrael is an apartheid atate, for instance the minister of agriculture and \nfishing Kasrils, who is himself of Jewish descent?\nThere are politicians who find lying to be a normal way of doing politics. \nMany of them know that they are lying. And they just continue lying in \norder to please people who hate Israel and in order to please people who \nthey believe have money and oil; in order to do so they make blatant lies.\nKasrils is a white man. So he never experienced the pain and suffering \nblack people had. He as a white person had privileges, had a better \neducation than black people. Why? White people were given a much better \neducation that we blacks did not have. Education was structured in a way \nthat we black people become forever dependent on white people. There were \nseparate schools, there was separate transport and separate hospitals and \nthe best was for white people. Even if you fainted in front of a white \nhospital you could not be treated there. You could never go into a white \nclinic. There were doctors whose white patients came in at the front door. \nIf the doctor was kind enough to treat a black patient then he did it in \nthe back room or in a store. We could never use the main entrance. Yet in \nIsrael everyone goes to the same hospital and gets the same treatment, be \nit a Jew or a Palestinian. They use the same means of transport and Jewish \nand Arab students go to the same university. Therefore it does not make \nsense for anybody who knows what is going on in the region to claim that \nIsrael is an apartheid state.\n\nWas there a political representation of black people in South Africa?\nBlack people were not allowed to vote, we had no say about the destiny of \nSouth Africa and because we had no vote we had no representation. Black \npeople voted the first time in 1995 when democracy was established. I heard \nthis morning that the former president of Israel was convicted in court by \nan Arab judge. In South Africa a black person could never accuse a white \nperson. Black lawyers could never represent a white client, they could \nnever listen to a case having to do with a white person. What do Arabs \nexperience in Israel? Do they experience what we had? No. There would not \nhave been in South Africa a struggle against apartheid if we had the same \nprivileges Palestinians enjoy.\nWhy do some Palestinians claim that Israel is an apartheid state?\n\nI think it\u2019s just a strategy that the Palestinians are using to get \nsympathy. Most people in the world were sympathetic to black people in \nSouth Africa because of apartheid. The Palestinians saw the sympathy at \nthat time because of apartheid. Now they think that if they use the same \nword apartheid, that the sympathy that the people had on blacks in South \nAfrica will be upon them also as Palestinians.\nHow could peace be achieved between Jews and Palestinian Arabs?\nIn order to build peace and democracy, all stakeholders must commit \nthemselves to the following:\n1) All role players must accept the right of the Jewish and democratic \nstate of Israel to live within safe and secure borders.\n2) They must have respect for the human rights of all.\n3) They must stop poisoning the minds of school children and teaching them \nto hate.\n4) They must commit themselves to end violence and all terrorist \nactivities, and replace them with sporting and cultural activities and \neducation for/about peace."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Q2ElmXMq2AkuFqGPZxvaw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "kingofallwhites", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13itf154oushp42g22uirszvzvxh42c", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-30T23:44:30.957Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4Q2ElmXMq2AkuFqGPZxvaw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.5991280000000001, "formal_score": 92, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-30T23:44:30.957Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101519089094078220760", "textDisplay": "+RR Sandler I don't need a lecture on Apartheid you little punk.

Jews were promised a land that includes both now day Israel and Jordan \nwhile they, the Jews, vowed to full civil rights to all citizens Arabs and \nJews. the Arabs refused it and wanted a Judenrein country of their own. \nthis is how Jordan was established. next during the 40's, the Jews were \npromised a country in what is now israel, including the West Bank and Gaza. \nthe Jews vowed to full civil rights to all citizens, Arabs and Jews. the \nArabs refused that and wanted it all while the Jews were to serve as \nd'immis, with no rights, as Haj Amin Al Hussaini said to the UN delegates \nin Jerusalem. this is not why the Jews returned to their homeland. they \nwant to live in their own country, deciding their fate and future with no \nfear, away from their enemies. \n2. There's no Palestinian people. it never was. there are Arabs in the West \nBank and in the Gaza Strip, and they want to example themselves from \nIsrael's rule. not like the Jews, they don't have any uniqueness over any \nArab in the region or in the world. they have the same ethnicity, the same \nculture, the same traditions, the same traditions, the same dominant \nreligion, and the same language. the only reason that they will probably \nhave a country of their own is because they are in Israel and Israel can't \ncontain such a large amount of population who doesn't recognize the Jews \nbond with the land of Israel, historically, religiously and nationally. \n3. about the Gaza Strip and its tunnels, there are two types of tunnels \ncoming out of Gaza. one are facing the Egyptian border, from which they \nenter supplies such as food, cement, weapons, artillery.., and second type \nof tunnels which are facing the Israeli border, through them they lunch \nground attacks against nearby town and civilians and border patrol guards. \nyou said it yourself, actually there is no blockade over the Gaza Strip, \nthey can get what ever they like. unfortunately for their citizens, their \nleaders the Hamas, have decided that they prefer to fuel their hate for the \nJews and Israel, rather than take care of their citizens. instead of \nbuilding buildings, schools, hospitals, parks, working places, they built \nterror tunnels to Israel and even use their supply tunnels in the Egyptian \nside to promote terror attacks in the Sinai peninsula against Egyptian \nsoldiers who fight IS groups there. the money which was given to the Hamas \nfrom the West and the gulf states was spent on terror and not development. \nin contrast to the PLO who used its contributions to the welfare of his \ncitizens and with the help of Israel built the new Arab city of Rawabi \nwhich is now starts housing the buyers. the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, \nare all about destruction of Israel, not the development of their citizens \nlives. \n4. Israel does not want the Arabs to go away, but to recognize its \nlegitimate right in this land. Israel has a long timed bond to the land, to \nJerusalem and to the Temple Mount. while the Arabs repeatedly seek for \nexclusivity. the 'Palestinians' want a Judenrein in the West Bank even \nthough there always been a Jewish community there especially in the holy \ncities of Jerusalem and Hebron. Israel sees the now days settlers as the \nfollowers of this old Jewish community there that were exiled from their \nhomes by the the British who decided to punish the victim and grant the \naggressors in the 20's and 30's riots and killing that the Arabs set upon \nthe Jews. the Arabs need to understand that the West Bank won't be a \nJudenrein state and Jews will continue living there even if it means that \nthey will be under an Arab rule. Having the same rights as the Arabs have \nin Israel. last but not least, the Arab in the West Bank have to promise \nthey will not pass the sovereignty they'll be given or part of it to any \nelements, Unless they wish to give it back to the state of Israel.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12gc1yortywvljmq22lvnbx5taaun4pk04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUfevbbHdEGkD7_qMOgo8Wg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Aiden Rojani", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-14T04:29:34.638Z", "videoId": "iPVKSiTmU8s", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUfevbbHdEGkD7_qMOgo8Wg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.58292600000000006, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-08-14T04:29:34.638Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116517081038745872889", "textDisplay": "Liberals have always been anti jewish anti zionist.
