I honestly thought \nwhen we saw the video we were going to see her attack him and lose a fight. \n Obviously, still ethically/morally wrong, but I figured a safe guess based \non the charges being plead down and mild NFL punishment.  Again I want to \nbe clear that even in that, now hypothetical, circumstance Rice is \nundoubtedly wrong.  You bear hug her or you cover up and take a few lumps \nand then leave her ass, you don't hit her with a full force left cross.\n\nJust my two cents as someone who wasn't rabid for his banishment for life \nor for Goodell to be fired upon first hearing about and seeing the original \nvideo.  Having seen the whole video now, the NFL and Ravens made changes to \nget this right, Rice will likely never play another down in the league.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ciferpv2yzpcie04chjqofy3quh2rjaw": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd_sOXVUvoY7eORIxY7eIxQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9eVXr-v666Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/SvntjIEfFFs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MrClownDroid", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-09T06:02:05.519Z", "videoId": "BzRT2m6Cp8k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCd_sOXVUvoY7eORIxY7eIxQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.71589199999999997, "formal_score": 95, "updatedAt": "2014-09-09T06:02:05.519Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100940763222930738384", "textDisplay": "Hate how confident woman when they get physical \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13gtxo4usmzfjdgy04cjhd4cpfruxapj0w": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHzmYF8Itg-mXHv9m1ATsNg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ESfXQMUNltI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/r1ywLey85C4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kether Emmanu\u00ebl", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-10T05:35:52.657Z", "videoId": "BzRT2m6Cp8k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHzmYF8Itg-mXHv9m1ATsNg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.56102600000000002, "formal_score": 9, "updatedAt": "2014-09-10T05:35:52.657Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113400544481721197387", "textDisplay": "Ray rice \"finally\" has to answer for his actions? \nAs a foreigner I really don't understand, I mean this is case of domestic \nviolence with a ton of evidence where the perpetrator pleaded guilty and \nremorseful and the victim forgave and even married the perpetrator, Ray \nRice showed throughout his career to be a good guy (charities, kids help, \nthe whole nine yards).

The right to self defence \nis and has always been a HUMAN right.  \n\nThis is where the next counterpoint comes into play: \"We don't want to give \nmen a free pass to hit women\". I agree. It's an option that should never be \ntaken lightly but when you have a two people that supposedly have the same \nrights but one is held to higher standard of responsibility then we a \nrecipe for disaster.\n\nWomen are the ones who are held to a lower standard of responsibility than \nmen especially in cases of domestic violence. Like that cliche view that \nyou wouldn't hit someone with glasses. As if the object itself removes any \nsense of accountability that the wearer may have and on face value it is \nreally quite ludicrous. When it comes to girls and women, their smaller \nsize and strength is often used as a way to minimise the degree of \nresponsibility they may have in an altercation. A shield in the form of \ninfantilization that can in effect give them a 'free pass' to assault men \nand in all fairness and equality should never be aloud to happen.\n\nI respect women too much to exempt them from responsibility and I need to \nsay this to any who may be reading this:\n\nYou are no better than me. You are not special and you are not exempt from \nthe consequences of your ACTIONS.

Like how some people say if women dressed more modestly then \nthey wouldn't be raped. I mean you can't expect men to control themselves \nafter all.\n\nSelf defense is ONE thing. Hitting someone back because they hit you is \npetty. It's like when a child shoves his friend, then his friend shoves him \nback because he shoved him and they go back and forth both thinking that \nthey have to make it equal.\"\n\nWell, if a man hits a woman back in self-defense that IS the woman's fault. \nDo not talk about how men should have restraint when  attacked when a woman \nshould have the restraint to not hit in the first place. He is not the only \nadult. SHE is as well. And should not hit someone and then not expect to be \nhit back because she's a \"girl.\" Petty? Depends. A woman hitting a man and \nthen crying victim when he hits back is MUCH MORE petty. Also we are not \ntalking about rape. No one ever says women are raped because clothes. It's \nalso not the same since women in the case of self-defense  I am talking \nabout are the attackers not him. It's a woman's fault when she dicides to \nput her hands on someone. It's not the man's place be nice to someone who \nattacks him.\n\n\"I find this strange since ATM's didn't exist back in the day, nor money. \nBodyguards against what? Other MEN.\"\n\nNo money did not exist but women did expect resources such as being able to \nbring home the meat or for protection. Also, money is a sign of bringing \nhome the bacon and providing for kids and providing for family.Get it? It's \nabout resources. You REALLY need to study prehistory to see what I am \nsaying.\nNo. Not just other men.Also animals.What? You thought we humans always had \nthis comfort of being sheltered from nature and danger? Yet again study \nprehistory to see what I am saying. Civilization existed only within the \nlast 6,000 years. Of course they can't be bodyguards when women decide to \nattack another woman. Since the attacker is a woman I'm guessing society \nwould not be okay with that. Oh well.\n\n\"If the ONLY expectations men have are womens bodies for reproducing then \nwhy do most men not even want children, just sex?\"\n\nBecause sex leads to children. Those who didn't like sex obviously \nreproduced less than those who did.

You cut out the build up youre left with \nthe action\" we dont know what led them to fight, we dont know what she said \nor did beforehand we dont know enough to make firm decisions on this. \nthere's no audio for fucks sake we dont know. but the only argument anyone \ncan make in her defense is \"oh yo dont hit a woman for any reason, if you \ndo then youre not a real man\" well to be honest some women have it coming, \nand maybe she did too. like bill said, you cut out the build up and focus \non the action, lack of context is always bad. simply put, they all want to \nbe protect under the law based on gender for something they do all the time \nbased on gender. as far as this video goes, he shouldnt have hit her so \nhard. a slap or pushed her would have been sufficient, a punch is too \nmuch. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13exj5gjm34ipscb23tghi5jubshloq104": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0v1Sw1mUut-xqTv0PcXJow", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cJZ9EhQ_W1c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASo/c_KvnByrNvY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "bakenfat", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-09T20:35:51.426Z", "videoId": "BzRT2m6Cp8k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0v1Sw1mUut-xqTv0PcXJow"}, "sentiment_score": -0.13493400000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-09T20:35:51.426Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107228793683884272543", "textDisplay": "So she married Ike Turne....Ray Rice.

You make a point of him once \nusing his foot as she is lying in the doorway, implying that he is trying \nto hurt her. Clearly at this point is is just trying to get her out of the \nelevator. Try handling a limp body yourself and you may find that trying to \nuse your foot as support is completely reasonable. You seem to assume \nmalice everywhere.\n9. Yes, you might say he should instantly have called 911 and not even \ntried to get her out of the elevator. However, it is the correct procedure \nto put an unconscious person on the side, with bent hip and knees! When you \nsay that he seems not to care, what are you basing that on?

If women are so equal \nand deserving of equal treatment, they are also deserving of equal \nresponsibility.\n\nIf he pushes her because she won't do the dishes, cheated on him, insulted \nhis manhood, jail him, but if he fights back against an aggressor, man or \nwoman. it's self defense, regardless of the threat level.

Same crime, same punishment. Is she losing her job for \nassaulting him?\n\nLet's not forget the biggest joke of the whole story. He beats her down and \nshe goes back to him.

What are you going to say? \n\"Look the other way, you dreadful old bastards\"? What are you going to say? \nIt's part of the joy of life is admiring the beauty of things that are \nbeautiful. What is important to me about the Boy is that once upon a time \nhis beauty was understood and celebrated by people of both sexes. A boy was \nallowed to dress in very bright colours, he was allowed to show himself off \nin the street, he dyed his hair, he wore make-up, he wore a little cap \ntipped over his eye with a big feather in, he wore tight pants and cropped \njackets and so on. And the girls looked down from behind their jalousie and \ntalked about the best-looking boys.\""}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZx0nccjw3UNardtzdSlLdA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Hosenbisla", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nuduo2mygepl12225t1fotkm0wl02a", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-09T17:05:13.369Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZx0nccjw3UNardtzdSlLdA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.74262600000000001, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-09T17:05:13.369Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110418046447243511036", "textDisplay": "+philajfran well ... someone who published a book of photos of underaged \nnaked boys for the visual pleasure of female seems vile to me ... \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_Boy\nimagine a man publishing such a book with little girls ..."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBs0diu7ZubPDYUQ8phQWFg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tony Vega", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nuduo2mygepl12225t1fotkm0wl02a", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-09T14:40:44.107Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBs0diu7ZubPDYUQ8phQWFg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.15865799999999997, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-09T14:40:55.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105427506514855662189", "textDisplay": "+philajfran My dad has already done this to my mom.

Feelings like this are natural \nminutes after watching videos like this. But let me give you the other side \nof that coin so you can have some context, not about this video/instance \n(although watching the video, it does pertain to this case as well), but \nabout abuse in general.\n\nWomen abuse men A LOT more than men abuse women. You might be thinking, \n\"but how? Men are physically stronger. Women definitely don't abuse men \nmore than the other way around.\" This is the problem. Society and (white) \nwomen's groups don't condemn abuse in totality. Women constantly abuse \nmen-mentally, psychologically, emotionally and verbally. I (along with my \nparents) was/am a victim of this kind of abuse from a female relative-a \nwoman. But society and (white) women's groups don't discuss and condemn \nmental, psychological, emotional and verbal abuse often enough-if at all. \nAnd because society and (white) women's groups don't discuss and condemn \nthis, both men and women in society have been conditioned and trained to \nthink that it's acceptable and that it isn't a serious offense like \nphysical abuse is.\n\nJust look at sportscaster Stephen A. Smith, recently. This was a man who \nreceived vitriol and hate from (white) women's groups and feminists for \nsensibly educating the women in his household not to psychologically, \nmentally, emotionally and/or verbally abuse men by provoking or inciting a \nsituation that could lead to them being physically assaulted. And (white) \nwomen's groups and feminists went bonkers. They condemned him, yelled at \nhim, called for ESPN to fire this hard working man, making stories and \nfabricating lies about how he was allegedly blaming the woman who Ray Rice \nreacted to.\n\nThis is the double standards that (white) women's groups have practice and \nstill practice.

If you can't see your bigoted logic here then there's something \nwrong, which we already know what it is.. misandry! Now the whole thing of \nhim being stronger... the same people who will say violence is never ok \nunder any circumstances from anyone will not apply this to women because \nthey are weaker. If violence is never ok from anyone regardless of \nstrength, degree, intent then her actions should be equally condemned, not \nonly that she was the attacker and he the defender. She knows this guy is \nway stronger than him so the only reason she would attack him in the first \nplace is because she is taking advantage of society's double standard that \ndemonizes men even when they defend themselves.

They were both too ready hit each other. If a woman hasn't \nbeen hit before, the first time is a total shock, & they don't fight back. \nBut over time they learn to take it, & some do fight back. And if a man of \n27 hasn't hit a woman before, he's very unlikely to start doing so, even in \nthe middle of an argument.\n\nIn relationships where violence happens occasionally, the threshold at \nwhich blows start getting thrown falls, especially if people have been \ndrinking.\n\nBut let's say I'm wrong, & this was the first time Ray has hit a woman. It \nwas what hid did & failed to do after she hit the floor that's most \nprobably ended his career.\n\nHe callously dragged her out of the elevator, & displayed no concern for \nher. That's why I feel he must have hit her before. He was due to marry the \nwoman the following month, yet after a blow that resulted in her being \nknocked unconscious, & he just stood over her. That is the action of a \nperson that is capable of thuggery.\n\nNow for her. I think she was provoked. She was walking past him, ignoring \nhim, when he must have said something, because she reacted by turn back at \nhim at throwing out her arm. Then in the lift he crowded her. That is \nintimidating, & she tried to slap him away, that's when he really slapped \nher. For an instant she covered up, but when she realised that Ray had \nbacked off she went for him. She wasn't acting, she was reacting.\n\nBut what she's done since sends all the wrong messages about domestic \nviolence. If a woman can be hit like that, & end up blaming the media & \npublic opinion for Ray being sacked & indefinitely suspended, & the knock \non problems for her, then there's something wrong with her.\n\nShe puts up with the violence because Ray doesn't show his dark side often, \n& she hopes that Ray will change. He might do, he only stayed out of prison \nby agreeing to attend counseling. But just by marrying him, not condemning \nhim, & apologising for her actions that night, she saying by example that \nother women should accept being hit because they in some way provoked their \nman.\n\nA lot of people on this thread are saying exactly that. But men who can \nexercise control do not hit women, no matter how they're provoked. My wife \nreally provoked me a few times. We would get raging mad & she did hit me \nonce, but it just never occurred to me to hit her. She'd hit me but she \nhadn't hurt me. I'm 90 pounds heavier than her & nearly a foot taller. I \napologised to her the next day, I'd realised I'd pushed her beyond her \nlimits.\n\nBut Ray's limit before hitting a woman is low, as is that of all men who \nhit women. Most women just can't really hurt a man, but they can hurt their \npride, & that's when some men strike back.\n\nIf Ray had immediately cared for the woman he 'might' have saved his \ncareer. She was charging at him. But just standing over her shows that he \nreally didn't care."}}]}, "z12jchionvrwy11z004cjf2ipxv5v3ozxk00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoz-7cpCElh8i592y8b9UvA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "markalexander774", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-09T08:23:38.254Z", "videoId": "BzRT2m6Cp8k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoz-7cpCElh8i592y8b9UvA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.538794, "formal_score": 9, "updatedAt": "2014-09-09T08:23:38.254Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110637680803813661179", "textDisplay": "Do I think Ray Rice is a decent human being?

I have a serious question though. Is physical \naggression just the one thing that \"gender equality\" doesn't have to do \nwith? I don't think a man should hit a woman in any way because (in my \nopinion) it's hardly ever going to be a fair fight. You can call me sexist \nor whatever you want but that is also the only reasoning I can see against \ndomestic violence (other than the very reasonable argument that all \nviolence is bad).\n\nThe only thing is if you want to define the factors that lead to most mixed \ngender fights being unfair you would have to list the differences between \nwomen and men, in capability and in the general population. That's \ndefinitely not what the gender equality movement (as far as I can tell) \nwants. I know like most other reasonable people that men and women are \ncrazy different. I also know it's stupid to say that either one is better \nthan the other, that's like saying oranges are better than apples. Just \nlike apples and oranges, I think it's stupid to say that men and women are \nequal across the board. (Rights shouldn't have anything to do with any \nclassification of person) \n\nSo again how does the fight against domestic violence line up with the \ngender equality movement? If we are all completely equal then why would one \nparty in a fight be the only one charged with a crime? If we are all \ncompletely equal why would gender even come into question during the case?\n\nI have a personal vendetta against domestic violence and I don't want \nanyone to think I'm trying to excuse it. Thing is I read feminist shit all \nday all over the internet and there are several subjects that I sincerely \nagree with them on, but after enough well written articles and carefully \nformed (one sided) arguments I start to sympathize with the movement in \ngeneral. I can't stand hardcore feminists but there is substance to gender \nequality and I feel myself wanting to speak out on some of the issues. Then \nsomething like this happens and every seemingly smart person that's made \ngood points in the past about equality (like Ana or Cenk) is just outraged \nbecause someone won a fight. If you take gender out of it it looks like \nthis: #1 strikes #2, #2 pushes #1, #1 strikes back, #2 strikes #1, #1 \ncharges at #2, #2 strikes #1, #1 is unconscious. If we're being completely \nunbiased #1 (Rice's fiance) began the altercation. \n\nIf you disagree with me please don't be mean about it, but I'd like to know \nwhy. Real quick I'm saying that domestic violence is horrible criminal \nbehavior. I'm saying that the feminist movement (the one the general public \nsees and the one represented by people like Ana) is spreading an ideology, \nthat I believe, supports the idea that gender shouldn't matter in any \ncontext. I'm saying I can't agree with that because of things like this. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z120cpzyanu2ffnxz04cf3qhsnrdubnpvww0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8awMF9Orbz1HBo_UFA71ww", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_JM8f4A260w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAfY/8Ex5N1ZXm0Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tessa Morgan", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-09T14:48:43.299Z", "videoId": "BzRT2m6Cp8k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8awMF9Orbz1HBo_UFA71ww"}, "sentiment_score": -0.78540199999999993, "formal_score": 13, "updatedAt": "2014-09-09T14:48:43.299Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107727667946517515399", "textDisplay": "What's with people fighting in elevators?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wbZ4WakgTmh5sDdkvbrsw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "chasemebaby", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z120cpzyanu2ffnxz04cf3qhsnrdubnpvww0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-10T19:55:52.160Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9wbZ4WakgTmh5sDdkvbrsw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.37179399999999996, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-10T19:55:52.160Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EVDUZHaueFU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApM/qD0CGNSy9E4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106580530932392188492", "textDisplay": "I think its more about the help leaking hotel elevator footage to the world \nmore.

But neither do I condone her slapping him both \ninside and outside the elevator then charging at him, however it seems like \nno one want's to talk about that and if you bring it up prepare for a \nhailstorm.

Definition of physical abuse \n\"Physical abuse is abuse involving contact intended to cause pain, injury, \nor other physical suffering or bodily harm. It includes hitting, slapping, \npunching, choking, pushing, burning and other types of contact that result \nin physical injury to the victim.\" Like a said before I don't advocate \nviolence against women, but I also don't advocate violence against men \neither.

Bull shit Ana!\n\nIf a woman pushes a man, she deserves to get pushed back\nIf a woman slaps a man, she deserves to get slapped back\nIf a woman punches/kicks a man, she deserves to get punched/kicked back\n\nPEOPLE IN THIS WORLD NEED TO KEEP THEIR FUCKING HANDS TO THEMSELVES. DON'T \nATTACK PEOPLE, RESPECT PEOPLES PROXIMITY & DON'T THREATEN THEM. Because \nonce you've physically assaulted someone whatever they do to you in return \nfrom the point (with some obvious exceptions) is justified. Male or Female.\n\nThis Video doesn't show that Ray Rice seems to have instigated things by \nspitting in her face outside the elevator which you'll see in the full \nvideo. Then she slapped him first (outside the elevator), then after he \nslapped her the first time in the elevator, she CHARGES towards him \n(clearly not scared) then he slapped her again.\n\nMy problem with this story is that Ray Rice's Wife DID NOT want to press \ncharges, but the state said, \"nah fuck u, we're pressing charges anyway\" \nwhen the only evidence that was out there was Video from OUTSIDE the \nelevator after the event. Where as the evidence in SOLANGE's case was \nevidence INSIDE the elevator of her going absolutely FERAL on Jay-Z in an \nuncontrolled fashion (unlike Ray Rice who was in control of himself & \nclearly knew what he was doing) & Solange needed to be held back by body \nguards. And when Jay-Z said \"nah i'm not pressing charges\" the state say \n\"okay, we'll let the bitch off then\". Why isn't that bitch in Jail?\n\nAnd just to point out, I see a guy SLAPPING his fiancee in this video not \nPUNCHING her, so stop with the bull shit propaganda.\n\nI wouldn't have slapped her in a situation like this regardless, & if she \nwas the instigator after she back-handed me outside the elevator I probably \nwould've overpowered her (without harming her) & let her know that she it's \nnever ok to put her hands on me, then left her ass right there & then to \nlet her think about whether or not she ever wants to fucking touch me like \nthat again. It is NEVER ok to initiate physical abuse towards your partner \n(male or female).\n\nBut when you look at the full video, he seems to be the instigator.\n\nAnywayz fuck this DOUBLE STANDARD that you all live in. NO IT IS NOT OK FOR \nA WOMAN TO HIT A MAN & it is absolutely no different to a man hitting a \ngirl, doesn't matter if he's stronger. I'm 5'8\" (male) & I wouldn't go \npunch Shaquille Oneal (7'1\") in the face & not expect him to punch me back \nbecause I'm smaller & weaker. If I punched him I'd expect him to come at me \nfull force with fist's flying. So guess what, I don't fucking going around \nhitting people for that reason.\n\nIt's really simple people, KEEP YOUR FUCKING HANDS TO YOURSELVES people, & \nthat goes for EVERYONE. It's not rocket science. The second a woman steps \noutside that realm & thinks it's ok to hit a man, she instantly steps right \ninto the GLADIATOR realm without even knowing it...

That was \nbeating a woman who was talking back to you, which is in no way an \nacceptable provocation to violence (if such a thing exists).\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z134izwallyltv03p22jj1350z2rhjoot04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKkDyRS3e1sOIgvYugon6-w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qApisV3DOK4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/Cmq5WVHdcG4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 5.882352941176471, "authorDisplayName": "ehsan74827", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-09T08:11:14.300Z", "videoId": "BzRT2m6Cp8k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKkDyRS3e1sOIgvYugon6-w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.38565200000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-09T08:11:14.300Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115326009472511994305", "textDisplay": "anna eat shit! cuz you are full of it!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13tghp5vz3wfjden22bi3554nmod5buh": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0N0nwglltqtG7CvF8ipY6Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-v0nSVHABXjU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADk/pbsscPPe4Q4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.69930069930069927, "authorDisplayName": "Sir Amic Varze", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-16T05:43:47.363Z", "videoId": "BzRT2m6Cp8k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0N0nwglltqtG7CvF8ipY6Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.89427570000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-16T05:43:47.363Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112490056944856880572", "textDisplay": "Too many pathetic pussies defending him.
