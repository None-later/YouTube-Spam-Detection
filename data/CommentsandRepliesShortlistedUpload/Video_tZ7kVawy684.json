We need a government. It doesn't have to be \nbig at all, but it must do a few things in order to maintain capitalism.\n\nCapitalism isn't some magical construct that materializes out of thin air. \nIt's a system that the British invented which seeks to minimize coercive \nforce by making people accountable to each other in fair trade deals, then \nestablishing a series of public institutions that lock each other's powers \ndown and allowing the people to closely inspect each of them and change the \npeople seated in them as they see fit. Therefore, capitalism and democracy \nare closely connected. You actually can't have one without the other, and \nwe see plenty evidence of this throughout history.\n\nThe problem is that you can't eliminate coercive force. You need it to \nuphold capitalism itself. If people can just steal from you, they don't \ncare if you \"shun them\"; they've got everything they need. At that point, \nyou need coercive force, i.e. a prison system and a judicial system, to \nstop them.\n\nYou also need defense of the realm. You cannot reasonably expect the people \nto rally when enemies are invading by themselves; you need something to \ndefend them. This is why we have police, firefighters, and the military.\n\nCapitalism will naturally tend towards monopoly if you allow the private \ncontrol of infrastructure, as the game Monopoly clearly shows. Now I know \nMonopoly is some kind of propaganda because it assumes that you are coerced \ninto staying on the roads and the hotels on which you land each turn. This \nis of course false - assuming the roads are open to anybody at any time. If \na private entity can control infrastructure, this isn't the case, and \ncapitalism breaks down.\n\nThis is why there is literally, as far as I know, not a single country on \nEarth where the main infrastructure - like power grids, plumbing, \nrailroads, and roads - are controlled by a private institution. It just \ndoesn't work. It's suicide for a free society to allow that, and we're \nseeing exactly why this is the case in the US right now simply because \nwe've allowed ISP's to control internet lines.\n\nYou can't rely on anarchy to maintain capitalism. It just won't work. You \njust get outlaws, and marauders, and people going into gangs and beating \neach other up. Even in the presence of some coercive force we still see \nthese kinds of groupings. The local gang around the street doesn't give a \nfuck about you think of it as long as you pay your dues. The only way you \ncan stop it is calling the police. Without government, and without coercive \nforce in the form of tax money to fund this police force, you wouldn't have \nit.\n\nWe must strive to make sure that the majority of the people controls the \ncoercive force that is available, and we must have it available to us. It's \nthe only way.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12virs45vmyuxtlu22ugplikompcvhyc04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_myfcbLLcTp9pz50lzeEMQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-V_Iinzg94Wk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIw/LG_ZxwJPtDs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 6.0606060606060606, "authorDisplayName": "Matthew John Hayden", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-20T10:16:14.274Z", "videoId": "tZ7kVawy684", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_myfcbLLcTp9pz50lzeEMQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.507884, "formal_score": 9, "updatedAt": "2014-08-20T10:16:14.274Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108904953584531492027", "textDisplay": "Oh Stef you fucking sexy bitch - Somalia 1 and 2 linked in the corners... \ncunning.

As an Atheist in an \nAnarchistic society what chance would I have if an uneducated rabble \ndecided to come kill me for not believing? Who would say they're wrong? Who \nwould protect me, and if somebody did - why?\n\nPart of being human is to have some sort of system of hierarchy. We simply \ncannot exist without it as much as we can exist without the urge for \nrelationships, food or sex. Even though the system may be corrupt - to be \nhuman is to be corrupt. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z122gv3qclbmjvwit04cc5nqiyqkiz1b12c": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe7vO_V3e8hrUe-68ysYsdw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vGrDmvnQX2M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/wxWGXbmacio/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Friedbard Von Mises", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-23T23:20:49.175Z", "videoId": "tZ7kVawy684", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCe7vO_V3e8hrUe-68ysYsdw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.11065600000000003, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-09-23T23:20:49.175Z", "likeCount": 10, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106530249397209774008", "textDisplay": "You said you'd link to somalia arguments below, YOU LINKED TO THEM ABOVE IN \nYOUR VIDEO...\n\nStefan debunked people...\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z134yhdaimzvdzl1r23gcbeaovjgzdeye04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu0D5fQiImJEcoqwwAQxNNA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-k2jymvFRP2A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEs/-SEXcHnlbU4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "shreddedreams", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-20T18:48:28.011Z", "videoId": "tZ7kVawy684", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCu0D5fQiImJEcoqwwAQxNNA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.58325399999999994, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-05-20T18:48:28.011Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100517593918719606291", "textDisplay": "I'm confused, this thunderfart guy, is he ripping on Stefan or not, because \nStefan is commenting saying the thunderfart person is cool?

The problem with subsidizing something is that you'll \nget more of it, and hormone birth control has infested our water supply, \nplaying a large part in generationally decreasing testosterone in males and \ncausing birth defects, further having birth control encourages unsafe sex, \nand the impoverished are already experiencing epidemic level STD \npropagation. Further still, having the taxpayers eat the cost takes \nresponsibility away from the individuals, infantilising them and insuring \nan even greater disregard for the consequences of risky behavior. BC being \ncovered by obamacare insurance is fine, but the government is not a parent \nand it can't keep shielding people from consequences, and it should no more \nbe responsible for the costs of unwanted pregnancy than for the costs of \nfree birth control.

Such loaded words shirk the responsibility of the arguer to \nlevy reasoned out points.\n\nHe does levy points, but they hinge upon these loaded words.  In a way, \nthey are passe, as those loaded words are merely another form of \nstereotyping that has been proven irrelevant by those who use reason rather \nthan definitions outlined by some exterior \"authority\" to themselves.\n\nFor instance, let us look at the mainstream media.  Fox News has managed to \nattach the label of \"radical right-winger\" to anyone who believes in \nanarchistic ideals or even Libertarian ideals.  This is ad hominem, Sophist \ntrickery levied by a proposed authority which is rather a double entendre \nof logical fallacies.  Not only is it an appeal to authority logical \nfallacy, but it is also a bandwagon fallacy.\n\nThe preponderance of evidence as to which political theory is actually \nviable/sustainable is not only in the favor of the Libertarian/anarchist, \nbut is so in the extreme.

Unfortunately, this as also \nbeen one of the driving factors (if not the primary one) that has led \npeople to believe that Capitalism is the problem.  With central banks, a \nfundamentally socialist idea, we have never had Capitalism.\n\nIt is very ironic.  The only node that is fully professing that a \ncentralized institution (government) is actually the answer to the world's \nills to the point of convincing otherwise intelligent and critically \nthinking individuals that this is true, IS THE STATE.

Even ancap utopia \nwould have governments no matter if you wanted them or not because you'd \nneed a force to uphold your ancap ideals, and ironically, prevent the \ncreation of a government by having some type of consolidation of wills - a \ngovernment. The only alternative solution to this dilemma is some world \nwere everyone's thinking the exact same thing, have the exact same values. \nThat's simply not realistic and pure idealism.\n\nNow that's just the dilemma on the \"anarchism\" issue. To include capitalism \nand private ownership into this, that just makes things even more \ncontradictory since capitalism and private ownership is built on \nhierarchies. Because if I own a piece of land I'm effectively the \nruler/government of that land and under ancap logic I have the right to, \nwith force, throw out intruders trespassing my property and dictate my own \nrules. Am I not? If people renting a home on my property does not like it \nthey are free to leave are they not? So no coercion, right?\n\nNow this property could be just a house and a garden, but being a good \n\"entrepreneur\" that could soon expand and eventually there would be little \ncity states ruled by monarchs who are legitimate \"capitalist\" owners of \nthat city state. Since these monarchs are the legitimate owners of the land \nby capitalist and private property logic, they also have the legitimacy to \ndictate who gets to enter this land and what rules apply while dwelling on \nhis property, what fee/rent/tax to pay etc.\n\nTo me the end result of ancap philosophy would then be a world with \n\"nations\" ruled by a bunch of monarchs with free movement of capital \n(including people).

No-one is arguing that stealing is universally preferable as a \nrule (this is contradictory based on the definition of the word 'stealing' \nsince it's logically impossible to advocate stealing from oneself (it \nwouldn't be stealing)), the question is whether any specific action \nconstitutes 'stealing'.. and the extent to which one can account for \nanything in the world is dependent on the rapidly expanding scientific \nbodies of knowledge, neuroscience, psychology etc.. So what constitutes \nviolations of the NAP are determined with reference to vast bodies of \nknowledge to which there is asymetry amongst persons. This asymetry \nlegitimates the use of force in instances where a party who have superior \nknowledge use force in order to prevent another party from a serious \ndetrimental consequence that they, with the time and capacity to aquire \nfurther knowledge, would not choose. In such an instance the initiation of \nforce would be shown to be moral by the demonstration that one party had \nacted upon a superior understanding of the situation. The NAP is therefore \nnot universally true in and of itself (unless it's from a god's eye view \n(it assumes a metaphysical perspective and no such perspective exists, \nwhich puts it in religious/fundamentalist territory)), it's merely more \ndesireable that people do things voluntarily but for this to be possible \nthe demands of any particular circumstance have to accomodate it. So this \nis entirely dependent on the systems that are possible to put in place \nthrough which society is constituted. Therefore it's wrong to argue that \nlibertarians shouldn't focus on the means through which a voluntary society \ncould function, the means are EVERYTHING. This is a technological issue, \nthe question is how to put in place systems that maximise liberty. Ranting \nabout the government being 'evil' whilst choosing to live in a statist \nsociety is misleading/misguided when the only way to show the value of \nprinciples of liberty is to show how liberty can be maximised, which is \ntechnologically dependent.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13rhrkagqb4hhszz04cj1ljmsylhxwhy1s": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbn031xMt0D4fYqcgOvcJhQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Typho0n", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-16T06:45:38.706Z", "videoId": "tZ7kVawy684", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCbn031xMt0D4fYqcgOvcJhQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99605244999999998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-16T06:45:38.706Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105751183550519964734", "textDisplay": "Yeah I never really liked listing to Thunderf00t, Go Stef!!!!!!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13tijxxczqwcb2qq04cgvpqhxu5whvq2kg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTiwAWq6KUKn6LG9kDYkKkg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "stevenpaddybwoy", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-18T14:03:14.962Z", "videoId": "tZ7kVawy684", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTiwAWq6KUKn6LG9kDYkKkg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.91695210000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-18T14:03:14.962Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102571961111092884109", "textDisplay": "Im sorry but i have to say that Thunderf00t looks like a member of NAMBLA.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ae50buv3rch0wa04cdt2a5rm2hzbqxsk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF5-jAFkJEdIWHS8HvbF3Ng", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "notalefty999", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-16T11:23:00.139Z", "videoId": "tZ7kVawy684", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCF5-jAFkJEdIWHS8HvbF3Ng"}, "sentiment_score": -0.42728000000000005, "formal_score": 96, "updatedAt": "2014-08-16T22:52:23.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104144151575602726383", "textDisplay": "I think arguing that states dont exist in the real world, them merely being \nconcepts, is problematic.

Ideally, \nyou want intelligent and responsible people procreating. You dont want \nstupid and irresponsible people procreating.\n\nThe reasons for this are that A) Intelligent and responsible parents will \nhave better parenting practices than stupid and irresponsible ones and B) \nIntelligence, and the traits which comprise responsibility, empathy, the \nability to defer gratification, cooperativeness and so on, are all somewhat \nheritable. If you take IQ as a reasonable proxy for intelligence, that is \nabout 75% heritable amongst adults. The children of stupid and \nirresponsible parents will be disposed by both their upbringing and their \ngenes to greater levels of economic dependency, criminality and a whole \nhost of other social ills. \n\nSo the quality of future generations, and by extension the prosperity of \nsociety as a whole, in no small part depends on who it is who is having the \nmost children.\n\nIntelligent people are generally more economically productive, resulting in \na non trivial correlation between income and intelligence. So paying those \nwho cannot support children themselves to have them basically means paying \ndumb people to have more kids. This is a generalisation, and exceptions \nwill exist, but in the aggregate, subsidising the fertility of the poor \nmeans lowering the average IQ of future generations. \n\nResponsible people dont have children they know at the time they have no \nmeans of paying for, expecting others to foot the bill. So those who choose \nto avail themselves of the welfare provisions that allow them to have \nchildren they themselves cannot pay for, by relying on taxpayer's money, \nare disproportionately going to be irresponsible. \n\nBaring this in mind, what do present welfare policies achieve? Well they \nsubsidise stupid and irresponsible people to have children, by forcing \nintelligent and responsible people to pay for their children, thereby \ndepriving intelligent and responsible people of money which they may have \nused to raise more children of their own.\n\nTherefore, present welfare policy has a negative effect on both the quality \nof parenting and the innate intelligence and responsibility of future \ngenerations. And whilst the continuation of civilisation does indeed \nrequire the raising of children, it requires the raising of children who \nare likely to grow into productive and law abiding adults, not the raising \nof children who will likely grow up to be a social and economic burden. \nWelfare policies do not increase the number of the former, they increase \nthe number of the latter.\ufeff"}},

Though I do understand and \naccept the moral and philosophical justifications for completely \neliminating it.\n\nThe issues I have are with just a few services that I can't see adequately \nbeing provided by the free market. The biggest one, the military. First \noff, how would it be funded precisely? Would there be multiple private \nmilitaries? People in each community can choose to pay for them or not, but \nif people don't pay, they still benefit from the protection of the \nmilitary. So, beyond a sense of honor, why would anyone voluntarily pay for \nit? They'll get the benefit no matter. Which means no one would end up \npaying, or too few. The logistics of managing and overseeing the military \ncause me concern too. I think a government is necessary to fund and manage \na purely defensive military.\n\nNext would be Police and courts. Mostly the same issues with funding. The \nlogistics of it don't sync up very well for me and I can see many conflicts \narising with multiple competing police forces, though it could work if \nthere was a government around purely to establish baseline laws, only the \nmost basic. Simple examples, don't murder, don't steal. Basic stuff like \nthat. Courts are necessary to settle contractual disputes and other \nmatters. In a complex society, they are essential. \n\nThe last one is actually that catching memes... but what about the roads? \nAnd don't get me wrong, I think most roads can be entirely privatized for \ngeneral travel around the country, between towns, highways, bridges, etc... \nbut inside towns, especially in residential areas. I can't see it working \ntoo well. How would a toll road function if the road is right in front of \nmy home? Also, what about sidewalks? It seems highly impractical for towns \nto have privately funded roads, unless there is a different method of \npaying for them other than tolls. \n\nThose are essentially the only real concerns I have.

That's not what science does.\nPhysicists accept General Relativity as valid under some circumstances, but \nnot others (e.g., black holes and particle physics). So can the NAP be \nvalid under some circumstances, but not others? For example, it is wrong to \ninitiate force by pushing someone out of the way in order to be first in \nline for concert tickets. But what if we change the circumstances? Let's \nsay someone initiates force by pushing someone out of the way in order save \na child from being hit by a car. Is this immoral? Both situations have an \ninitiation of force by pushing. We've just changed the goal of the person \ndoing the pushing and the outcome of the pushing. So if the initiation of \nforce is always wrong no matter the circumstances, then it would be immoral \nto save the child by pushing. But if we accept the NAP the same way \nscientists accept physical laws, then it could be that there are at least \nsome circumstances in which violating the NAP is not always immoral.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12lx1ahnoekfp3hd04cd1upgwvgdpyr1wo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHszZkQx3mWN3XxzeBmqC8g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.2048192771084338, "authorDisplayName": "Alvor Real", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-18T02:00:21.116Z", "videoId": "tZ7kVawy684", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHszZkQx3mWN3XxzeBmqC8g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.34659599999999996, "formal_score": 58, "updatedAt": "2014-08-18T02:00:21.116Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106312179083175036080", "textDisplay": "@ 8:35 being an atheist does not mean that they commit themselves to logic \nand reason.

If you want to be \nreally disappointed, check this series out: http://youtu.be/Ju4C_ITlBsU . \nDuring this conference, a panel of 16 of the very top living philosophers \nand physicists including: Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Alex Rosenberg, \nand Steven Weinberg, come to the point of talking about the necessity of \nuniversal healthcare, and everyone's heads start bobbing up and down about \nhow they agree with this. These people are way beyond atheists, they are \nexperts in the scientific method as it is commonly practiced, and widely \nrespected as top thinkers.\n\nThere is no link that I have noticed between intelligence/scientific \napproach/empiricism and consistent support for the NAP. Why? Because the \nNAP is a personal preference, not a universal preference, and voluntayism \nis about opting in, not about \"truth\". The exception, I find, is that there \nis good evidence that prosperity is best supported, in most cases, by \npeaceful trade instead of redistribution (aka plunder + stated \njustification). For some reason, the majority of highly rational people \naren't interested in reviewing this evidence as presented in e.g. Ridley's *The \nRational Optimist* . Or, if they have reviewed it, find it an insufficient \nbasis to support peaceful trade over plunder.\n\nClaiming to have jumped the is/ought gap with rationality is not rational \nthat I have seen. So even someone as intelligent as Stef is getting caught \nin the web of murky thinking. Philosophy is not only *not easy* but it is \ninsanely difficult in this world that is so deeply steeped in violence, and \nthe ability to deal well with abstraction (sometimes confused with \n\"intelligence\") seems to provide as many pitfalls as advantages in \napproaching it.\n\nIn any case, I obviously agree with Stef on the efficacy of the NAP \n(regardless of his confused implications that he has no interest in \nefficacy due to the matter having been already resolved by means of \nrhetorical tautology), and he does a nice job here of laying out the \ntypical sales pitch for the NAP. However, I am unsure about why he would \nconjecture that a person like Thunderf00t would support the NAP... few \nscientists and intellectuals do. Science, atheism, and philosophy amount to \nreligion for many people. How? Because they have blind faith in them to one \nextent or another. Only skepticism can yield deeper truths, and anyone who \nclaims they have certainly valid first principles is not skeptical enough \nto think clearly: at least that is my experience.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z132g3pjgq3tvnqcb23gc5kplofefzp4j04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC626EDP-f38lXP93yXLsstQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheProsecuter", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-16T18:41:50.178Z", "videoId": "tZ7kVawy684", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC626EDP-f38lXP93yXLsstQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.57397000000000009, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-16T18:41:50.178Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112202645654844052357", "textDisplay": "At least Thunderf00t was absolutely destroyed rhetorically by all the \nreplies that all other youtubers posted in response to him. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ryj3z5yflepv2c22qvjjgak3senk25": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOrB0Wkzj7EreU0avWeHgbg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-54_zaOcttZs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/D-7hw1O8-tw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dave Mayton", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-18T03:12:42.320Z", "videoId": "tZ7kVawy684", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOrB0Wkzj7EreU0avWeHgbg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.351462, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-08-18T03:12:42.320Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102570483439267674369", "textDisplay": "In your video on Depression not being a medical condition you explicitly \nstate that the metaphysical exists yet cannot be scientifically observed or \nexplained.

But on \noccasion, he makes one I do decide to watch. Unfortunately I usually have \nto stop the video at some point, and unfortunately its usually early on.\nThis time I made it to 4 minutes.\nThunderfoot's comments, to which Molyneux was obviously intending to \nrespond, made it pretty clear what he was planning to say in this video, \nand I'm well familiar with the arguments against coercive redistribution \n(for the record, I agree with them), so listening to him retreat them isn't \nnecessary; hearing what Thunderfoot was complaining about was enough to \ncome up with some choice answers on my own.\nDo I dislike Molyneux? No. I think he and the other anarchists can get a \nlittle sanctimonious sometimes, but its not much of a failing, and both of \nus ride the same train in the same direction: towards a freer society. I \njust get off before them.\nBut I get really tired of listening to arguments for anarchism, when I \nreally haven't heard any new ones in a long time.

Barre had a vision for a \"Greater Somalia\" which \nincluded the forcible annexation of neighboring land masses from other \ncountries to expand Somilia's \"rightful\" territory. First stop was the \neastern region of Ethiopia, known as Ogaden. Somalia invaded Ethiopia in \n1977 and for 8 months fought a long and brutal war. They lost the war, as \nwell as 1/3 of their army, and had to retreat in disgrace. Huge portions of \nSomalia's population felt Barre betrayed them, and the first opposition \ngroups began forming. Most of these resistance militia factions were \ndirectly funded by the Derg (Soviet Union), who wanted to destabilize and \noust the Barre regime. It finally happened in 1989-1991, and the rival \nfactions and tribal leaders have been warring ever since. So it was not \nanarchism, anarcho-capitalism, etc - that got the ball rolling, it was \nMarxism, socialism, everything worthless shitbags like Thunderfoot and TYT \nbelieve in.

Never mentioning \n50+ years of exclusively Democrat party mayors and leadership. Same \nstrategy over and over again.

If we recognize a qualitative \ndifference between humans and cattle that allows us to use them as food, \nwhen all we do is corral them, couldn't god design whatever purpose for he \nwants for that which he created through sheer force of will?\n\nNot only this, but Colossians, for example points out that such a deity \nwould also be holding the universe together as we speak. So, a god creates \nand continues to support the existence of something, but he isn't allowed \nauthority over it?

Great point, never thought about it that way.\nI'm not much of a libertarian or worshiper of absolute voluntarism over \nwell-regulated statism/socialism, but some of these points are admittedly \nvery hard to argue with rationally. I guess the core difference basically \ncomes down to your personal faith in humanity, as to which one you would \npreferably like to see in place. Libertarians tend to pull a little more \ntowards an altruistic utopia where people will just take care of each other \nthrough charities (which is considerably more common in the U.S. compared \nto the rest of the world, just so everyone is aware of that fact) while \nliberals tend to want to guarantee that same utopia via government force, \noften because of the discrimination going on in the religious organizations \nusually running those charities. Both ideologies are unlikely to work in \ntheir respective fundamental extremes (real life communism/socialism turns \ninto quasi-fascism very quickly, unregulated capitalism eventually leads to \nutter economic chaos) which is why I don't consider myself to be in either \none camp. Hence I am also acutely aware of the tendency of atheists to \nacquire religious habits towards government programs or other convictions \nand institutions, which is why I am so very frustrated with the progressive \nleft (TYT etc.) right now, even though I do consider myself much more \nliberal than conservative. There is a reasonable balance to be struck here \nthough and it depends on the kind of society we want. The left seems to \nhave adopted the angry mob tactics that used to be championed by the \nconservative side when faced with secular ethics and morality arguments \nsans deity. Tables have turned.
