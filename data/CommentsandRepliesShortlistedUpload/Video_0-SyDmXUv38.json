Bundys' not a thief! he a fucking national \nsecurity risk! he's going to force another god dammed wako on this country, \nI can fucking feel it. and whats worse, after he gets killed for being an \nIdiot and not following the results of his day in court, nut jobs are going \nto spin it that he was some 'last bastion of america' or what ever the fuck \nthey circle jerk to nowadays and then their will be the gods dammed \nconspiracies I can fucking see it now, their already fucking happening.  \n\ngod fucking dam it do I hate arguing on the internet."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/user/SHUTTERSHOT45", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "SHUTTERSHOT45", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z131dtg5cwejwlhgg04cgjsbaz3tctvwxog0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-26T05:53:18.113Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxWqlhmDlq4nQ0Jv5hD2wlw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.16839599999999999, "formal_score": 25, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-26T05:53:18.113Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107482350086365176019", "textDisplay": "+Thomas Duponti Ahhhhh....

(and omg you actually refer to lefty-wing go to \nsnopes as so called 'accurate info' on a right-wing cause? That tells you \nsomething right there about how smart or bias you might be.)\n\nFACT: The land Bundy's cows are grazing on is land they want to 'mitigate' \nfor land further north they are using for the Dry Lake Solar Project which \nHarry Ried and his son are involved with. Google: Cattle Trespass Impacts \nhttp://archive.today/nvlzr\nScroll down to \"Examples of Restoration Funding . . .\" you will see the \nsolar project listed there as a reason for removal of Bundy's cattle.\n\nNotice how that doc use to be on the BLM website but they deleted it to \ncover up the truth (the grazing land is connected to the solar project), \nand now it has to be archived by people smart enough to make a back up of \nit for posterity. The fact they tried to cover it up tell you they have \nsomething to hide. And check out this: \nhttp://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/blm_library/tech_notes.Par.29872.File.dat/TN_444.pdf\n\nYeah, this all started 20 years ago, but why all of a sudden after 20 years \ndo they finally get around to \"collect\"? Could it be because Reid was in a \nhurry due to the solar project? Hmmm? Yeah, China got impatient and walked \nout of the deal. Who's to say they can't walk right back if they \nsuccessfully remove the cattle?\n\nAnd your reliable source doesn't tell you why Bundy didn't pay the fees did \nthey? Oh he just decided not to pay them? Are you really that easily \nfooled? They didn't tell you he couldn't pay them even if he wanted to did \nthey? They canceled his grazing permit all together, so there was no fees \nactually due. No permit, no fees. No, they just wanted him off the land. \nYour reliable information source didn't tell you how they wanted to limit \nthe number of Bundy cattle to a ridiculous low number that there would have \nbeen no way to support the ranch, did they? I didn't think so. And they \ndon't tell you how 52 other ranchers who cooperated with BLM in all the 20 \nyears are now out of business did they? I didn't think so.

If I run my car into a mail truck, do \nwe need to hold a statewide vote to see if I have to pay for the damage?  \nNo, that's why we have laws and the court system.  Bundy doesn't own the \nland and never did.  There are no records to show that the family homestead \nextended into that area.  It was unclaimed land, and according to the \nNevada Constitution that made it property of the United States Government.  \nFor a long time, however, the government did not regulate cattle grazing.  \nNo one needed a permit and cattle could graze as they pleased.  \nUnfortunately this free-for-all led to irresponsible grazing practices, so \nin 1934 the US passed the Taylor Grazing Act.  This required ranchers to \nobtain grazing permits and specified that grazing cattle in an area did not \nconfer any right of ownership to the rancher.  The grazing laws were \neventually updated in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act of 1976.  These changes were upheld by the Supreme Court's \nruling on Public Lands Council V. Babbitt in 2000.  Bundy refuses to pay \nhis fees as required by law, therefore he has violated the law.  He \nattempted to challenge this in court, but he has consistently lost.\nNow he throws an armed temper tantrum.  The Feds backed down, not because \nthey lacked the moral high ground, but because they could have lost it if \nviolence had erupted.  They chose to, instead of risking violence, continue \nto pursue the matter in a peaceful manner.  If they had not and it resulted \nin a bloodbath, then I would have been outraged at the government.  They \nhave a responsibility to seek peaceful measures when dealing with citizens, \neven if they are being irrational and threatening violence.

After all, the government paid judge \nagreed with the government.\n\nAnd, this makes sense? This is passed off as rational, non ideological \n thinking?\n\nLet's think about this a little more TYT, shall we?\n\nIt's like believing the promises made by the Armed Forces Recruiter right? \nAny promises that were made to you, are not part of the deal at all. And, \nyou cannot, under nearly every circumstance, file suit against the \ngovernment for breaking the terms of it's contract with you.\n\nSo, the message TYT is sending to you folks who thrive on TYT's image of \n'neutrality' is that, the government is YOUR master as opposed to the idea \nthat the government is your servant.\n\nYou may agree that this is a fair grazing fee, the tortoise is worthy of \nrescue, and Bundy should pay his bill. A simple lien on his cattle will \nsolve the fee issue. The tortoise is a totally different issue, since the \nBLM turtle rescue facility reportedly killed over a thousand of the little \nbuggers cause developers have stopped developing and that development is \nhow the turtle rescue was funded.\n\nBut, most importantly here, this is primarily an opportunity to instruct \nour employees (the government) that they work for us, they are our \nservants. Keep in mind, the court ordered confiscation of these critters \nwas employed with about 200 armed, body armored 'land managers', \nhelicopters and sniper rifles. A lien on the cattle will suffice, Bundy \nsells em, you get the cash. Debate the limits of herd size on it's own \nmerit. I don't guess Bundy can make a living with 150 head of cattle.\n\nWith the internet, a person can get the perspective of Rachel Maddow, Alex \nJones and Cenk Uyger in a matter of minutes. It's easy to see the \ndifference of opinion, the difference of 'leanings' and on this issue, Cenk \nleans toward Rachel. Alex might speculate that Cenk is a \ngovernment 'asset'. The fact that Cenk did not explore the concept of BLM \nregulations being applied as law is one indication of the possibility of \nthat speculation being correct. The fact that Cenk did not explore the \ncourt decision of another Nevada rancher v the BLM, where the BLM was \nreportedly found to be 'conspiring' to remove the rancher, ordered to pay a \nfine and has not complied. Eliminates Cenk's argument that court orders \nmust be adhered to because that is 'how we do it in America'.\n\nYou can't have it both ways Cenk. Come out of the closet. You are a \ncollectivist.

Who exactly decided that the Government \nthat works for us suddenly owns any land in this country? The government is \nnot a private entity. It's a body of people we elect to work for us. It's \nnot a corporation. It's not a business. It's not a private entity of any \nkind. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/user/garrie6666", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "slaughter lord", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z132cngjhk3sehk0z22gzvhhumf1stacd", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-16T06:45:34.683Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmLGkWQJXTuUvT5zMyPh7vw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.64313400000000009, "formal_score": 97, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-16T06:45:34.683Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QJ0QQMzEKzk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGs/IFSeH1RHahw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102099394106861491879", "textDisplay": "Yup Cenk would never report about the euthanizing of the tortoises.\nAnd he failed to mention the no fly zone period, and snipers surrounding \nthe ranch."}}]}, "z130vtpyiyflcf5z104cettxlkndul0z2rc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 12, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrT7v8fmc5e1IEnN_rVS8SQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Allah T'Nonsense", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-16T01:24:04.989Z", "videoId": "0-SyDmXUv38", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrT7v8fmc5e1IEnN_rVS8SQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.81154380000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-04-16T01:25:27.000Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109342441995139200115", "textDisplay": "Huh, I just watched the video he's talking about.

I do not like the \nfact that this whole dispute played out perfectly for the real criminals in \nall of this ! The US Government and Senator Reid and son! Wake up people! \nThis is just another False Flag Op! The govt. knew Bundy was a simple \nminded twit, they also knew he was a racist, as did most of his friends and \nacquaintances, a racist with a big mouth! He was perfect for what they had \nin mind! First you need to know about an activist who is against selling \nour country, hook, line and sinker, to corporations from communist based \ncountries or to the governments of said countries, a man by the name of Rex \nWild, at least I think that was his name, the YouTube video regarding his \ncriticism of the BLM for doing this right under the peoples noses, \nmagically disappeared, imagine that? I Wonder why? Anyway, this Mr. Wild \ndiscovered while researching the BLM's nasty habit of\npractically giving away federal land to China and other oppressed nations, \nfound out what the BLM had done in this case and threatened to go public, \nmere days before this fiasco and was told to take a hike by the local \nauthorities, and by government spokespeople for the BLM, this Rex Wild had \na problem with the BLM selling American owned land for peanuts to a Chinese \nsolar corp. and letting Senator Harry Reid's son profit from land that \nbelongs to not him but to the citizens of this country, this land, \nregardless of whether Cliven Bundy is a racist sewer rat or not, is not the \nproperty of some pretentious politician's son! Reid has absolutely NO \nbusiness selling federal land and is, despite this truth, trying to proceed \nin unlawfully selling even more of our country to communists! So the govt, \nput a bee in Cliven Bundys bonnet, so to speak, knowing it was just a \nmatter of time before the heat was deflected onto Oathkeepers and their \nfellow patriots, even going so far as to direct him into contacting \nOathkeepers, by telling him \"Oathkeepers couldn't even stop this from \nhappening, we are taking your cattle and prosecuting you, you'll probably \ngo to prison for this!\" So of course Bundy follows thru as easily was \nanticipated and calls on the truest of patriots to heed his calls for help, \nwho, all along, are completely unaware they are being set up! Anyone with \ncritical thinking skills knows this game is as old as the hills and is \nplayed out over and over, and because people are still so easily misled, \nany one who tries to point this out is ridiculed as a tinfoil hat wearing \nconspiracy theorist kook! No one but those who know Bundy's reputation as a \nblatant racist and an opportunist, which isn't that many people really, t \nit amounted to locals, and the Reid's sneaky shills in govt., as they \nresearched, months prior, the ranchers grazing on federal land in the \nimmediate and adjacent lands to determine where the solar project was to \ntake place, and to cover their asses should someone call them out, well \nthey hit the jackpot with Cliven Bundy, being the boob that he is he fit \nthe bill perfectly. Since the BLM knew some may come forward complaining \nabout this squandering of American land to communist China, and the illegal \nprofits to be made by Reid's son, they needed a distraction, just in case, \nthey always think this way prior to any wrongdoing to cover their sorry \nselves, ALWAYS! This time they really got lucky, I mean, come on! what \nbetter way to discredit or embarrass Oathkeepers and Anonymous than to have \nthem all rally around someone who is a blatant racist? It certainly takes \nthe heat off the BLM and at the same time discredits those who are members \nof \u00ffanti-tyranny, anti-communist organizations, who were actually starting \nto garner support from more and more mainstream citizens! How convenient, \nand my, what a coincidence?

In 2003 Federal agents with back up from local cowboys swept onto \nthe Dann sisters traditional grazing lands in helicopters, on ATVs, and on \nhorseback they confiscated 504 horses that belonged to the Dann sisters. at \none point elder Clifford Dann doused himself with gasoline to stop federal \nagents to no avail. In the end the Federal government hung a 3 million \ndollar bill around the Dann sisters necks and kept their horses. Mary Dann \npassed on in 2005 at the age of 82. Carrie is still with us. The Western \nShoshone land claim was upheld by the United Nations. The United States \nrefuses to acknowledge the treaty.\n\nCarrie and Mary Dann Ordered by the BLM to remove livestock they owned from \ncontested Shoshone tribal lands. Forced to comply.\nCarrie and Mary Dann Ordered by the BLM to remove livestock they owned from \ncontested Shoshone tribal lands. Forced to comply.\n\nSo here we are in 2014 and white ranchers are still using their faith to \nsteal our land and Indigenous people who have a real and spiritual claim to \nthe land are still being herded, harassed, and intimidated into giving it \nup. Had Cliven Bundy been an Indian we would be talking about a dead \nIndian. White millionaires just have an amazing ability to get whatever \nthey want.\n\nPersonally, I believe that Indian people should follow Cliven Bundy\u2019s lead \nand forcibly seize treaty land back. If all a millionaire Mormon rancher \nhas to do to refuse to pay his taxes and invite a few friends with M-16s \nover to the house and wave the guns at federal agents then I guess that is \nwhat Indian Country should do. The last time I checked when people did \nthings like this the government was accusing them of \u2018acts of terrorism\u201d. I \nguess not. I guess this means it\u2019s open season for anyone who wants to \nsteal from the government.\n\nThe absurdity of the BLM to back down in this situation is staggering. \nBecause he claimed that according to his Mormon faith he doesn\u2019t have to \npay for grazing fees? Really? The legal ramifications of this will resound \nall over the country if the US government refuses to hold this \u201ccowboy\u201d \naccountable to the same standards that a person of color, a poor person, or \nanyone else for that matter. The head of the BLM is either in on the gag or \nis a yellow chickenshit wimp.\n\nThe memory of the proud Dann sisters standing up to demand that the Ruby \nValley Treaty of 1863 be upheld. In 1979, the Us government offered the \nWestern Shoshone miniscule amount of money to abandon their claims to the \nland. 80% of the Western Shoshone people voted against the settlement and \nthe tribe, the nation, demanded the treaty be upheld. It has never been \nupheld. This situation is extremely troubling. The fact that the land that \nCliven Bundy was grazing his cattle on was possibly on disputed Ruby Valley \nTreaty land that had been stolen from the Western Shoshone is more than \nironic.\n\nIf the feds refuse to hold Cliven Bundy accountable for his tax liens then \nI say they can hold no one accountable. None of us should pay this sham \ngovernment a penny until it has honored all treaties with the indigenous \npeople of this land. What right do they have to round up some poor \nindigenous folks livestock for non payment of BLM grazing fees on THEIR OWN \nLAND and then walk away when some redneck millionaire screams \u201cI\u2019m a Mormon \nthis land is mine\u201d.  All of this happens on a backdrop of a government that \nstole a trillion dollars from the tribes that was then paid back 10 cents \non the dollar in the Cobell Settlement. The BLM, The Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, and the entire US government to blame.

Then we can come to the \nconclusion that this man is literally stealing from that business and he \nshould be punished for that.\n\nAlso, don't try that \"land of the free\" crap on me. People like me who are \nin discriminated minorities have a lot more reason to bitch about the lack \nof freedom then some old geezer who's trying to get some free grazing. He \ncould buy some land of his own for grazing, but instead he's stealing from \nfederal land to save himself a little money."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/user/FlamingTP01", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "FlamingTP01", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12eup1revevsrwej22hwbkitx2aenu1a", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-16T06:06:33.954Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQtrpiglQ2anZxhl-6UYfYA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.45441400000000004, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-16T06:06:33.954Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111608709535001322304", "textDisplay": "+Malcolm Marks\nIf your neighbor dies it belongs to your neighbor's family, or the bank \nthey bought the house from, duh.

Morgan interests, the steel, ship building and \npowder interests and their subsidiary organizations, got together 12 men \nhigh up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most \ninfluential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them \nto control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States.\n\u201cThese 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then \nbegan, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the \npurpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the \ncountry.They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of \nthe greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent \nto purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an \nagreement was reached;the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for \nby the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise \nand edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, \nfinancial policies and other things of national and international nature \nconsidered vital to the interests of the purchasers.\n\u201cThis contract is in existence at the present time, and it accounts for the \nnews columns of the daily press of the country being filled with all sorts \nof preparedness arguments and misrepresentations as to the present \ncondition of the United States Army and Navy, and the possibility and \nprobability of the United States being attacked by foreign foes.\n\u201cThis policy also included the suppression of everything in opposition to \nthe wishes of the interests served. The effectiveness of this scheme has \nbeen conclusively demonstrated by the character of the stuff carried in the \ndaily press throughout the country since March, 1915. They have resorted to \nanything necessary to commercialize public sentiment and sandbag the \nNational Congress into making extravagant and wasteful appropriations for \nthe Army and Navy under false pretense that it was necessary. Their stock \nargument is that it is' patriotism.'

Therefore like \nproperty you can sign contracts with an employeer for example who can \ndemand you give up certain rights in order to work for him.  A libertarian \nperspective would say that is okay because both parties agreed to the \ncontract, however a liberal would argue the contract is void because you \ncan't give away your rights.\n\nSo at first glance it might seem we agree.  Liberals and libertarians agree \ngays should be allowed to marry if they want to.  However libertarians \nthink states should be allowed to decide these property rights for \nthemselves.

I don't like it, I don't agree with it...but I don't HAVE \nto, because in the United States, they're legally in the right. The US \ngovernment, even as corrupt as it is, legally \"is\" the \"public.\" They act \nas representatives of the public. Or, they're supposed to, but that's \nanother issue.\n\nThese are the laws the government has passed for use of land that legally \nbelongs to the people it represents. If they passed a law saying we all had \nto wear 10-gallon hats while on federal land, and we LET them pass that \nlaw, then we'd either wear the hats, go home, or get penalized for not \nwearing them if we get caught. That's how this nation works. I don't agree \nwith every law that's ever been passed, and I certainly don't OBEY every \none that's been passed. But I know those rules exist, and I assume the risk \nfor not obeying them.\n\nThis goes back to something I've been saying for a long time: Law is by \ndefinition amoral. Morality is personal, law is passed by consensus. We \nhave no moral duty to obey the law simply to obey it, nor should we expect \nthe law to be moral by our standards. You don't have to believe any law is \nmorally right to go to jail for breaking it. But we have democratic \nprocesses in place for changing them. Bundy could have attempted to use \nthose processes 21 years ago, but he either didn't or he failed. But he \ndoesn't get to use a force of arms to get his way because he failed in \nthat.

We see that clearly with Cliven Bundy\u2019s 20 years of public land \ncattle trespass coming to a head.\nA cursory search shows a sudden explosion of articles claiming Nevada\u2019s \nsenior senator, Harry Reid, wants Bundy\u2019s land to build a solar plant to \nenrich himself and his son. Since Reid is the U.S. Senate Majority Leader, \nthe radical right has every incentive to harm him by buying this false \nclaim. Such a blatant lie needs to be exposed.\n\nCliven Bundy has been trespassing for 21 years over 750,000 acres of U.S. \npublic land to the south of Mesquite and Bunkerville, Nevada. Part of this \nused to be called the Bunkerville grazing allotment. Bundy had a grazing \npermit to it. A U.S. grazing permit is not fee simple ownership of the \nland. It is a mere rental. Bundy lost his permit to graze by refusing to \npay his rent. Bundy\u2019s actual private property in land is his melon farm at \nBunkerville, what looks like maybe 100 acres on Google Earth. There is a \nsolar farm under construction. But it is not on the huge swath of land on \nwhich Bundy\u2019s cattle trespass. The solar facility under construction is \nnear the Moapa Indian Reservation about ten miles closer to Las Vegas than \nBundy\u2019s place.\n\nThe Wildlife News has been critical of many solar farms in the desert \nbecause of the massive destruction of wildlife habitat, but this farm under \nconstruction is not one of the dangerous mirror farms like Ivanpah near \nPrimm, Nevada/California. It is a photovoltaic farm and it is being built \nto allow decommissioning of the Reid Gardner coal generation station \nnearby. Reid Gardner is one of the dirtiest coal plants in the nation. In \naddition, the new solar plant will also help the tribe which has been badly \nabused in the past, being left with only a 1000 acre reservation. No, the \nplant is not on the reservation. See the local newspaper: Reid Helps Moapa \nBand Break Ground On Solar Project. Moapa Valley Progress. March 26, 2014.\n\n\nIt is amazing that conspiracy theorist Alex Jones would actually publish a \nmap showing the location of the project. Anyone with the least geographic \ninformation can see it is not on the land where Bundy has been stealing the \npublic\u2019s grass for a generation.\nThere is also a solar farm proposal near Laughlin, Nevada, at the very \nsouthern tip of the state. Some of the right wing news outlets also \nconfuses this with the trespass land near Mesquite.\n\nHere is an earlier story about the Laughlin project. The Chinese Try to \nHarness the Nevada Sun. Regarding this plant, back on April 5, Bloomberg \nBusinessweek tried to work a negative Chinese angle. Now it too has been \nmorphed onto the public land where Bundy has no right to graze and where he \nhas threatened violence if not allowed to continue his illegal activity.\nThe only thing that has been proposed for the public land where Bundy\u2019s \ncows continue to trespass is some kind of protective classification like a \nscenic area, recreation area, national monument.\n\nThe right wing media is using the unfortunate public ignorance of Nevada \ngeography to make the attack by the armed mob on the BLM into a political \npoint against Senator Reid. Though it is doubtful Bundy knew what would \nhappen, his cause has already been picked up by the Koch Brothers and \nothers who really do want our public land \u2014 all of it. They want to \ntransfer it to private ownership directly or through the states. Their \nAmericans for Prosperity front group is trumpeting Bundy\u2019s cause. The \nanimosity between Senator Reid and the Koch brothers is well known. The \nKochs have already spent perhaps 50-million dollars in attack ads this year \ntrying to win a Republican senate majority this fall. Some Republicans \nworry these energy and chemical barons are trying to build a parallel \npolitical party.\n\nTogether the two Kochs have 80-100-billion dollars to play with, probably \nthe 5th and 6th richest men on the planet. They can now spend as much as \nthey want on American elections, courtesy of the Supreme Court. They can, \nand probably will spend more in 2014 than was spent in the entire 2012 \ncampaign.

Cliven Bundy and his clan paid \ngrazing fees for the better part of a century beginning in the early 1930s \nwhen grazing rights on Federal lands were formalized and codified with the \nTaylor Grazing Act of 1934.\n\nBefore the Taylor Grazing Act, these government lands were called \u201cthe \npublic domain.\u201d They could be privatized, under the Homestead Act and such, \nbut the acreage allowed per homesteader was limited to 160 acres. There \nwere no 158,000 acre homestead privatizations and certainly no 750,000 acre \nprivatizations. Livestock owners ran their livestock freely without a \npermit on the public domain. They didn\u2019t even need a home base of property \n(a ranch).\n\nThe result were a disaster because any landless livestock operator herding \nhis livestock (or letting them roam) onto public domain lands that could \nfind green grass first won out. This had the effect of promoting very bad \nand destructive and unsustainable grazing practices. That was the reason \nfor Taylor Grazing Act in the first place\u2014ranchers and others could see the \npublic domain system led to disasters, both to the land itself via \novergrazing (a major contributor to the Dust bowls in the early 1930s in \nthe arid west) and armed conflict or \"range wars\" on the ground.\n\nUnder the the Taylor Grazing Act, the ranchers with \u201cbase\u201d private property \nin the area received grazing permits. This got rid of the landless \nlivestock operators and effectively ended the range wars in the 20th \ncentury.\n\nTaylor Grazing was administered on the ground by the U.S. Grazing Service \n(long before the Bureau of Land Management even came into existence). Now, \nranchers with grazing permits had to pay a grazing fee to use their permits \nbut it also stabilized livestock and cattle ranching in the west.

Its a range war and we\u2019re \nfighting against a police state...What I am organizing are lots of groups. \nThey\u2019ll come from hundreds of miles away. They\u2019ll be multiple users; the \nhunters, campers, off-roaders, miners, sightseers, Tea Party people...First \nI\u2019m fighting this thing on paper. Then I\u2019ll go after the contract cowboys. \nAnd then if I assume they\u2019re ready to go, then I\u2019ll go after them with the \nmedia, with \u2018we the people\u2019 and whatever else it takes.\" \n\nNow, what do the words \"Range war\" and \"whatever else it takes\" mean to \nyou? How about the fact that he had called in the Oathkeepers and a bunch \nof militia and white supremacist groups with ties to violent criminals and \nhate crimes? \n\nAnd, let's recall, this was BEFORE the BLM even showed up. They didn't show \nup to take the cattle until April 7th. By the time they got there, they had \nevery reason to believe that Bundy and his family, at the very least, posed \na credible threat to law enforcement, and the people they contracted to get \nthe cattle. And then, you had Pete Santilli telling Federal officers on the \n7th that it was \"non-negotiable\" that they would be arrested and \"detained\" \nby \"whatever means necessary\" by the \"ten thousand people\" expected to show \nup.\n\nThat was BEFORE the fed showed up with all the heavy stuff...drones, \nsnipers, grenade launchers, ninjas...whatever else paranoid rednecks saw in \nthe dark. And that's exactly what I'm saying...Bundy and his (ARMED) \nsupporters displayed what anyone would have considered a credible threat to \nstaff, they made threats \"by whatever means necessary\" against law \nenforcement, and even said that they'd \"arrest them under the authority of \nthe constitution\" if they didn't comply. \"Non-negotiable,\" Santilli said.\n\nThe Fed responded to a credible threat with the presence of overwhelming \nforce, which is exactly what cops and military commanders have been doing \nsince the dawn of time. If it were me, I'd have at least called in a \nhalf-dozen Blackhawk helicopters and had them circling the area. Maybe \ncordoned it off while those people watched a little \"live fire\" exercise of \nminiguns on 900 cows.

Only one problem, guns don't kill people, people kill \npeople. So the real problem is, why are people shooting people at an \nalarming rate? What drives people to shoot other people? The obvious answer \nis Mental Instability, Fear & Desperation. Lets address these 3 issues.\nMental Instability - anyone listen to the side effects of the medications \nthey advertise on the commercials now a days? Think they may just have a \ntiny bit of influence on a persons mind?\nFear - With the amount of fear mongering going on in the media today, we \nwill have a collapse any day now, stocks shoot back up, end of times - oops \nthat was coming in 2016 not 2012 or 2000 or 1984 ....\nFinally Desperation - Hmmm lets make home loans as accessible as possible, \nthen crash the economy and make people more broke i.e. desperate than ever.\nAll of these issues can be taken care of and my guess is our gun problems \nwill go away as well as our problems with poverty. First we put into place \na law that doesn't allow pharmaceutical companies to make mind altering \nmedication. Now we cant blame somebody shooting somebody else because of \nthat crazy drug they were on.\nNext, we make the media public again, and take it away from the \ncorporations they belong to. We will then hear the news stories that we \nwant to hear and not the stories that the companies that own the news \nagency want us to hear.\nFinally we Enforce existing laws and write news ones imprisoning bankers \nwhen they cheat and steal from the people that entrust their money to them. \nFines are simply not enough, if executives that benefited from the \ncompany's thievery were imprisoned it would lead to people behaving more \nrationally and stop future generations of bankers from doing what this \ngeneration just got away with.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCGT_UOsvt8wP_RbKaS70xA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "arse scenic", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135t52gusi1g12sy23xhdrwyty0sfjct", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-17T21:29:27.439Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCGT_UOsvt8wP_RbKaS70xA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.048666000000000043, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-17T21:29:27.439Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LEY2KUjW-SY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAes/nlzyhNKPjJg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103048818269231282418", "textDisplay": "I can respect that.

I live in Montana \nwhich is by far more sparsely populated than Nevada or Texas. Dealing with \nthese issues is just life. The problem I personally have with this \nsituation is that the damage they have come to understand that cattle do \nhas been undervalued. The fish the erosion the disease spread through \ncommunal water systems spread by the cows all come into play. During the \ndust bowl they tried to encourage people to come populate the land and farm \nand ranch. That was the most recent anyway. This land after being \nestablished by maintaining it. Was then handed over to the private \ncitizens. Somewhere around 150 acres. These people then could still use the \nfederal surrounding land to graze. Since that time we have instituted many \nmore subsidies and incentives. These are all social programs which the \nfarmers are not by any stretch socialists trust me. They are as \nconservative as they come.The land they were using to graze alot of them \njust fenced in and called their own even though they were given parcels and \ngrazing rights they took much and more. We not only pay their wages and \nlosses from depredation and weather . We pay them projected earnings. The \ninsurance companies are acting as fronts. Some pay a portion of their \npremiums some do not. The federal government pays all of the losses and \npotential wages unearned. If they say they are going to make a million and \nactually make 700000 then we make up the difference. They then lock us out \nof hunting grounds and call it private property. They are the new land \nbarons and we are not allowed their deer and wild animals that we pay for \nthe damage and do not benefit from. They then lease this property out that \nisnt theirs and charge mass money to hunt. In Montana it can cost from 5k \nto 25k to hunt on private property. Since the inception of gps the people \nare busting them on these frauds. Just like this bozo. It is truely too \nbad. I so wanted this to be a good fight I did. I am the first to condemn \nthe federal government. In fact this is the first post I have ever made \nactually not condemning them. Look at my posts. We really need a cause \nright now as a nation. We need something to believe in and something to \ndrive us to a revolution but this bozo and his asshole lies are just not \nthem. The self serving pratter of the conservative base once again gets \ncaught lying on grand scales to get free money or entitlements if you will. \nThey just get called something else by them. Their rights. I am so sick of \nthese corporate asshole farmers telling us they own everything and we are \nnot allowed while they take our money and our right to feed ourselves. Go \nhome militia because this is the wrong fight. Ruby ridge this is not. Waco \nthis is not. This is a right wing fanatic religious nut thinking god \ngranted him the rights and screw the rest of us because its his land. Which \nwell its not and thats the point. I would charge someone to graze if it \nwere my land as well. If for no other reason to cover the damage he has \ndone while maintaining the land as good stewards. So please go thank a \nfarmer like fox news tells us to do on our rural radios and kiss your \nrights goodbye for theirs. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12dfngy5tjogjrlh23ae3aqova0c3x5w04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 16, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/user/Kimarusco", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0PMsuPW1svw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGM/HUC55s2p8hk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kimarusco", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-16T23:31:18.950Z", "videoId": "0-SyDmXUv38", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8CdkYQlMb_XxW22K73gxEQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.37396800000000002, "formal_score": 13, "updatedAt": "2014-04-16T23:31:18.950Z", "likeCount": 16, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109255289246194432454", "textDisplay": "Why are there so many trolls?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/user/CorporateEvolution", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "CorporateEvolution", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12dfngy5tjogjrlh23ae3aqova0c3x5w04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-17T07:32:25.610Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCR5N1LYt-e77ymsM3TI_g-Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.54093999999999998, "formal_score": 53, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-17T07:32:53.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7LIfPupbqUU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/p-wICRI4ZDs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107373330388193277503", "textDisplay": "+pr0tect0r7 As the majority of the slides are actually owned by well known \npublishers and I've seen 90% of the slides in first year university courses \nbefore including those that I have taught my opinions are:\na.)

But the state does have control \nover the counties just like the federal government has control over the \nstates. Look at it like a contract between states and the U.S. Yes each \nstate is individual and has the capacities to govern itself but together \nform the U.S. The U.S can exist with or without other states. Remember \nthere used to only be 13. It's the federal governments job to maintain the \nU.S as a whole and keeps it unity."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT2dCHdEJKbd8ZC5UGFCEqQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.44843049327354262, "authorDisplayName": "Dominick Dravinski", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qjn1glzzefxjy004cfnvjikieg3zwj30", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-22T01:55:13.940Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCT2dCHdEJKbd8ZC5UGFCEqQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.03072999999999998, "formal_score": 54, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-22T01:55:13.940Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105990038083850642966", "textDisplay": "Using that ideology you would have to go further and further down the \nchain.County land belongs to the county and not the state.

After a while the state not wanting to upset the BLM \nstopped taking the payments.\n\nWith all this happening the BLM wasn't giving up so around 1996 they made a \ndeal with the state of Nevada under the condition that the state retire the \nlands grazing rights permanently.\n\nEven though Nevada made the deal to calm the BLM they still let the Bundy's \nforage and better the land.\n\nThe BLM does not create laws.

Bundy has\u2026 failed to comply with multiple court orders \nto remove his cattle from the federal lands and to end the illegal \ntrespass.\u201d\nIt is the BLM, not Cliven Bundy, who is in violation of the law and the \nConstitution, specifically Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 of the \nConstitution.\nThe clause, known as the Enclave Clause, authorizes Congress to purchase, \nown and control land in a state under specific and limited conditions, \nnamely \u201cfor the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and \nother needful buildings,\u201d and not, as the feds now insist, to protect an \nendangered tortoise.\nThe Founders were opposed to providing a centralized federal government \nwith unlimited authority to purchase and, as is routinely the case today, \nseize state and private land.\nDuring the federal convention debates in September, 1787, Elbridge Gerry, \nwho later went on to serve as vice president under James Madison, contended \nfederal purchase of land \u201cmight be made use of to enslave any particular \nState by buying up its territory, and that the strongholds proposed would \nbe a means of awing the State into an undue obedience.\u201d\nIn order to make certain the federal government did not abuse the Enclave \nClause, the words \u201cConsent of the Legislature of the State\u201d were added.\nMadison, Jefferson and the Founders were primarily interested in limited \ngovernment and the diffusion of federal authority over the states for the \nprotection of individual liberty. In 1992, the Supreme Court issued an \nopinion on the framers\u2019 reasoning behind the state consent requirement (New \nYork v. U.S):\n\u201cThe Constitution does not protect the sovereignty of States for the \nbenefit of the States or state governments as abstract political entities, \nor even for the benefit of the public officials governing the States. To \nthe contrary, the Constitution divides authority between federal and state \ngovernments for the protection of individuals. State sovereignty is not \njust an end in itself: rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties \nthat derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nMadison knew unlimited federal power inevitably results in unbridled \ntyranny. \u201cI venture to declare it as my opinion that, were the power of \nCongress to be established in the latitude contended for, it would subvert \nthe very foundations, and transmute the very nature of the limited \ngovernment established by the people of America,\u201d he wrote.\nDespite the desire of the founders and the originating principles of the \nnation, conceived as a constitutional republic, the federal government has \nrepeatedly and habitually exacted dictatorial authority in Nevada and \nthroughout much of the West.\n\u201cThe United States government owns and has broad authority to regulate \nfederal lands in Nevada,\u201d the BLM arrogantly insists. \u201cIn response to \nchallenges of federal ownership of the lands in Nevada, the 9th circuit \nheld that the federal government owned all federal lands in Nevada, and \nthat those lands did not pass to the state upon statehood.\u201d\nThis is in direct conflict with Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 of the \nConstitution.\nCliven Bundy\u2019s struggle with the BLM in Nevada is exactly the situation \nMadison and the founders tried to prevent. The federal government does not \nhave the constitutional authority to own land, beyond what is stipulated in \nthe Enclave Clause, and its seizure of land, under the obviously fallacious \npretense of protecting a tortoise, is a serious violation of the \nConstitution.\nMadison made if perfectly clear in Federalist Paper 45:\n\u201cThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal \ngovernment are few and defined\u2026 The [federal powers] will be exercised \nprincipally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign \ncommerce\u2026 the powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the \nobjects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, \nliberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, \nimprovement, and prosperity of the State.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about our constitutional rights and statehood,\u201d Bundy has \nsaid. \u201cAnd whether this area known as the state of Nevada is owned by the \nUnited States government or is owned by the sovereign state of Nevada.\u201d\nMr. Bundy, despite a propaganda campaign to the contrary launched by the \nfederal government and its subservient media, is absolutely correct \u2013 the \nwar shaping up between the Nevada rancher and the federal government is \nabout states\u2019 rights and, ultimately, the rights of sovereign individuals.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbPv445PVUnEUaphgGvFmWw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Terry Koontz", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13yh3gryo2edvvqh04ccvohtrqwurmw354", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-23T05:22:27.673Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCbPv445PVUnEUaphgGvFmWw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.21768999999999999, "formal_score": 93, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-23T05:22:27.673Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105123713889181518702", "textDisplay": "You quote a section of the Enclave Clause, stating they added \u201cConsent of \nthe Legislature of the State\u201d.

You \nhave refused to address that fact, also.\nThey harass them to move them off the land for mega corporations to take \nover, and to implement Agenda 21, which very specifically outlines that all \nsmall farming and ranching business must be shut down, and populations \nmoved away from such areas and concentrated in big cities. \"Land cannot be \ntreated as an ordinary asset, controlled by individuals, and subject to the \npressures and inefficiencies of the market\". They also stated that \n\"individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective\"\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Agenda-21-Summit-Nations-Programme/dp/1482672774/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1397959084&sr=8-2&keywords=agenda+21\n\nWe know what those words mean, and where it leads, as we have experienced \nit throughout the history, and a reasonably sound person will know what \nAgenda 21 is, a tyranny take over under disguise of something else.\n\nIt's true that Nevada was a U.S. territory but it is a state now and has \nbeen a state for a long time. It is states responsibility to control it's \nland not federal governments.\n\nMadison made if perfectly clear in Federalist Paper 45:\n\u201cThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal \ngovernment are few and defined\u2026 The [federal powers] will be exercised \nprincipally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign \ncommerce\u2026 the powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the \nobjects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, \nliberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, \nimprovement, and prosperity of the State.\u201d\n\nBy recognizing Nevada as a state, federal government must recognize its \nrights protected by the constitution.\n\nJames Madison was trying to prevent an Agenda 21 scenario, and devide power \nbetween the states. Cliven Bundy\u2019s struggle with the BLM in Nevada is \nexactly the situation Madison and the founders tried to prevent. The \nfederal government does not have the constitutional authority to own land, \nbeyond what is stipulated in the Enclave Clause, and its seizure of land, \nunder the obviously fallacious pretense of protecting a tortoise, is a \nserious violation of the Constitution. Of course, the federal court has \nruled against Bundy not once but twice.

See \nyou can't even write one paragraph without trying to insult me. Typical. \nBut let me get back to the crazy violent accusation you made. It's ironic \nthat you call white people violent when everyday a  young black teen lays \ndead in the streets just pick any ghetto you like.I am going to lay some \ntruth to  you and I know your going to respond with your racist because \nthat is all you got.\n  \n  You can't even trust your own people. I have been in majority black \nneighborhoods good and bad and you can always tell when you are in the bad \none. When they have cages around vending machines and every home has bars \non the windows. Are those bars to keep the violent white people out? No, to \nkeep your own race from breaking in. That is why blacks move into white \nneighborhoods so they can be safe. Think I am racist for saying that? I \nhave had them tell me that is the reason they do it. I met a older black \nman in a gun store buying a gun and he told me he couldn't even walk to the \nmailbox without fear of being robbed. You want things to change for the \nblack people well it starts from within. Your people are destroying \nyourselves and you can't blame the white man for that. Drug dealing, men \ngetting women pregnant then leaving them to raise the child on their own \nand that child grows up to be angry and bitter. And that same child ends up \nin a gang or dealing drugs then winds up in jail or dead. Jay Z used to \nsell cocaine to people in his community has he gone back and tried to make \nhis hood better? You all want to accuse the white man of being greedy and \nselfish but I don't see any of the multi million dollar rappers making a \nchange in their neighborhoods. All they can do is rap about how rich they \nare and you buy it up like a sucker. They are basically bragging to you \nthat they are rich and you are not.

He even passed two lie detector tests! He said Trayvon the white kid \nwas going for his gun and that is why he shot him!

But there is a difference between what the \nmedia says and does and what the law will do. I am on your side on that \npart that he would have not been released and would have been arrested.

Proving again why I \nlove tyt. Always after the facts.\n\nSo, does federal land belong to us or the government? Your opinion on that \nseems to be wavering. If it belongs to us, the taxpayers, then taxpaying \nranchers shouldn't have to pay again to use land that their taxes pay for \nbecause the government changed its' mind syddenly. If the land belongs to \nthe government, then you & I can't claim that he's stealing from us. \nRegarding the courts ruling, imo that settles nothing. The courts ruled in \nfavor of George Zimmerman, they repeatedly decided that money in politics \nis awesome and that corporations giving money is even better. The courts \nare not on the side of you & I, they're on the side of the wealthy & the \ngovernment. The government doesn't represent us anymore, if it ever did. \n\nIf it's true that militias were involved (I maintain that this is not true \nfrom the hours of footage I've seen) it was not the best way to handle the \nsituation. I believe Bundy had weaponry to protect his family and cattle as \nTHEY were being threatened and cows were being sniped when the agents \ncouldn't remove them. Any guns I saw out were as a response to the agents \ndrawing first. BUT, I wasn't there. If there were militias there \nthreatening ageents (again, any threats. I heard were FROM agents) then I \nstrongly oppose that. \n\nI also oppose the state essentially saying \"yep we're going to totally \nbankrupt and ruin this guy for daring to defy us\". THAT isn't America, \nthat's tyranny. While I understand that he broke the law, their actions \nseem vindictive and overdone.

I said that I only \npicked Columbus as an example of the poor education system. Besides the \nfact that you told me to read a history book. I was just trying to point \nout that the history being taught is not correct.\n\nI guess we agree on a lot of things, it was just a matter of expressing \nthem properly. \n\nI am starting to understand the problems of minorities in the US. I was \nunaware, until watching more videos and reading posts, that the problem was \nso overwhelming. During my arguments (discussions) some people directed me \nto different web sites, news articles, and videos regarding said problems. \nIt is far worse than I imagined. It's hard to get a proper perspective on \nit since we don't have that much hatred here. Sure, there's discrimination \nbut it's usually in favor of the non-whites. We wouldn't want to offend \nanyone, would we? I'm not advocating white supremacy but the scales have \ntipped the other way and we don't like it. Yes, I'm white. \n\nIt appears that you have 4 very opposing factions and each one of them is \nstrong and each one is dangerous to the other. Right-wing, Left-wing, \nBlacks, and Whites, both of which could belong to either one of the \"wings\" \nor not. All are very militant and getting violent and/or greedy. Nobody \nseems to have a middle-ground or an answer. It probably won't get settled \nwithout violence. I believe that it is one of the main reasons why the \ngovernment wants to start a gun registry or prohibit gun ownership. They \nalready have the major centers earmarked, i.e. L.A., Washington, Baltimore, \nDetroit, etc. When all hell brakes loose they don't want too many guns out \nthere facing the police and military.\n\nI am pro-police because of our family structure and vocations. The police \nhave a good reputation overall. Because of the respect they get here I also \nargued with the right-wingers down there. Anti-establishment is something I \ncan't understand in a democracy. I won't go into all of my reasoning but \nagain, comments I have received have propelled me to look at police \nbrutality in the US and I can only say that I'm glad I've never had any \ndealings with them yet. \n\nThe more I learn the more I fear for the US and therefore Canada. We are \nknown to back the US in many endeavors including war. We won't be sitting \nback when the US implodes and perhaps explodes but exactly what Canada's \nposition and reaction will be is a mystery. \n\nSo that's my shit."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiIlqQ4ewmOPFQvIhmR5Kaw", "inappropriate_score": 1.3729977116704806, "authorDisplayName": "Dante Xavier", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13geruwqpbotf0it04cir5ovmjxetiywtc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-19T16:40:24.393Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCiIlqQ4ewmOPFQvIhmR5Kaw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.31827800000000001, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-19T16:40:24.393Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vW3DxaEOW3w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD8/su2D6QUn7Kk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118161383914366499188", "textDisplay": "+arse scenic Dude, U.S. history doesn't begin with Columbus.

It was STATE land and Mr. \nBundy  stated several times that he would WILLINGLY pay state or county \nfees, but since the federal government had literally stolen that land from \nthe state, he did not recognize their right to collect fees from it.  \nSecondly, you say that other ranchers pay the fees, but only this one \nrancher refused.  Were you aware that almost every other rancher in the \narea was put out of business by this very thing?  Did you understand that \nthe fees levied against him were INTENDED to drive him out of business?  In \nshort, he could submit to their tyrannical power and give up his way of \nlife, or he could stand up to them.  He simply chose the latter.\nNow, as to the 'gun toting radicals' who dared to face off against these \n'innocent' federal agents.  Did you bother to watch any of the videos \nshowing these 'innocent' federal agents tasering helpless citizens?  \nThrowing unarmed people to the ground and piling on top of them?

Currently they send a collection agency after \nyou. The collection agency will harrass you but lacking enforcement powers \ncannot do anything physically. Eventually the bank will sue you to recover \nthe debt. When you lose in court a judge will issue a court order for the \nsheriff to use force to seize property to be sold to pay off the debt. This \nis legal and done routinely. It takes time to go through these processes. \nMr. Bundy stopped paying for the privilage to make money off a public \nresource but exploited it anyway. That is how he accrued the debt. Like a \nbank, the BLM eventually took him to court, after Mr. Bundy had lost his \nclaim that the restriction of land to protect biodiversity was a taking \nunder the constitution. The judge issued an order that some of Mr. Bundy's \ncattle be seized and sold to pay off the debt he owes and like a sheriff, \nfederal agents used force to seize 400 cattle. The only way for this \nprocess to be unlawful is for the BLM to be acting outside the law to begin \nwith. The issues of whether the federal government have the authority to \nown land, restrict federal land use, and to charge for the private use of \nfederal land have all been adjudicated and were decided. You may not agree \nwith the decisions but once the judicial system has ruled that is the law. \nIf you do not want it to be the law then change the law. It is a tall order \nbut that is the system that our founders created and it is the lawful way \nto address your grievances not disobeying the law. You say that the law is \nunjust, so change it. MLK Jr. did. Why won't you? Being in a minority \nopinion that doesn't stand a chance in hell of changing the law does not \ngive you license to rebel. The BLM will be back to seize property from Mr. \nBundy and they will come heavily armed and his debt to the public will be \npaid. I am sorry that the Clark County Sheriff is such a chickenshit but \nwhat happened at the Bundy ranch was a rebellion and the correct response \nif for another militia to be organized to put down the rebellion. I am \nsorry that didn't happen. I am however thankful that the worst element in \nAZ is the Preatorian Guard and if they ever tried to pull that crap here, \nSheriff Joe, much as I dislike his other policies, would have it handled \nshortly.

Accusations and claims do not carry the weight of proof. \nDemonstrate that the government does not have the right to own or manage \nland.

They're absent of meaning and have no \nconclusion, other than this playground, i'm right you're wrong bullshit, \nfriend.\"\nI have given you the basis of my accusations and you have continuously \nrefused to address them.

If you expect me to refer to your God as though your god is the \none true god then you are being unreasonable.\nThe English language is dependent on several rules for sentence structure \nand word placement. You are not following those rules. That makes it \nimpossible to understand what you are trying to say. I asked to you \nrephrase in the hope that you would restate your thoughts with proper \nsentence structure. If you refuse then you are choosing to be incoherent. \nYou are choosing not to communicate. That is your problem and only you can \nfix it. I do not need you to spoon feed me, I need you to follow the rules \nof the English language, like everyone else does. Are you using a speech \nprogram? If so please edit what the program is putting down because it is \nnot working very well.

They are not based on facts and \ncannot be argued or objectively judged. People either agree or disagree \nwith an opinion. I care about facts. Your postings show that you do not \nknow the facts of the Bundy, BLM dispute. I am trying to educate you what \nthe facts of the case are and given the facts, that Mr. Bundy is wrong and \nmore broadly that his anti-government supporters are wrong.\n\"(You probably language nazi, also...\" I insist on a basic level of \nadherance to the rules of the english language. I do not care about \npuntuation or spelling, I care about using the proper definition of words \nand putting the words in the proper order to communicate accurately. If you \nput verbs or nouns in the wrong place it changes the meaning of the \nsentance. Similarly, if you put multiple nouns or adjectives and leave out \na verb then the sentance makes no sense at all. Every sentance must have a \nsubject and an action word. \"I meant what I meant and if you \"do not know\" \nwhat I'm trying to ask, [?], obviously not say.\" In this sentence it makes \nsense until you say, \"trying to ask,\" Here I expect to see the resolution \nof that thought but what you put after this is a pair of brackets around a \nquestionmark. The original thought is not resolved. You left it hanging and \nthen wrote an incomplete thought \"obviously not say.\" This incomplete \nthought lacks a subject and an action. This leads me to believe that you \nare using a speech to text program that is not picking up all of your words \nand is adding things you are not saying. If you are using a speech to text \nprogram then please make sure to edit the post before submitting. The \ntechnology is not doing what I think you want it too.\n\"Talking with people face to face must drive you up a wall.\" You would be \nwrong. I prefer to talk to people face to face. It makes communication so \nmuch easier. It allows me to take in the other person's tone, I can hear \ntheir words clearly, I can read their face and it allows me to communicate \nin a much shorter time period. In the last few days that we have been going \nback and forth through posts, I could communicate this in a single hour.\n\"That's rhetorical mockery, like you're inclined and oblivious to in total \nlack of empathy or basic self reflection.\" The first three words make a \ncoherent thought but you lose that when you say I am inclined and oblivious \nto, these are contradictory words. The sentence makes more sense if I take \nout the word in but I should not have to guess or try to fix your words. \nYou are responsible for communicating your ideas. If you fail in that \nresponsibility then you fail to accurately communicate your ideas and if \nyou are not communicating your ideas then what is the point of talking at \nall?\n\"Narcissists are like that; not saying you are but I've known my fair \nshare\" I do think highly of myself but not so much that I qualify as a \nnarcissist.\n\"also pathological liars have the tendency to become self convincing black \nholes of thought.)- my opinion.\" An opinion that I agree with, though if \nyou are implying that this fits me I would still like to see you tell me \nhow I am wrong and back it up with evidence as I have done for you.\n\"If none of those things describe you, I apologize.\" If you don't think \nthey apply to me then why did you mention them?\n\nI had to go back to your post about liberty after reading the link you \nprovided but I do not see a link between the liberty described in that \nletter and the way you used the word. You wrote,\n\"Your, \"we should follow all laws\" logic means you'll follow any law \nbecause it's called a law and any government because it's labelled such. \nThere's such a thing as God given liberty.\"\nIn the letter the word liberty is used to describe freedom from biblical \nrequirements of the old testament. In your post you use the word to imply \nthat god gives us freedoms from some if not all government restrictions. If \nyou are using the word liberty the same way the letter does then it is out \nof place is your post and irrelevant to the thought you were expressing \nprior to it.\n\n\"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, \nand be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.\" - Galatians 5:1\nNot being a christian I may very well be misunderstanding this but after \nreading Galatians 5:1-26 it seems to me that this quote refers to being \nfree from Jewish law and sin, not our government. Even if you believe it \ndoes mean being free from our government that still demands that you \nestablish that the government has enslaved you and I cannot even begin to \nfathom how you would do that.\n\n\"You have no clue what you're talking about when you quote bible verses \nbecause you don't believe, That's biblical.\"\nJust because I don't accept or submit to the bible does not mean I am \nincapable of understanding what is written. I can read it just fine. It is \nbecause I can read it that I refuse it. I find the murder, rape, and \ncondemnation offensive. I would not know about any of that if I could not \nread and comprehend what is written in the bible.\n\n\"You're approaching my opinions (reminder, these ARE opinions we're talking \nabout)\"\nThe scripture that I referred to was to demonstrate that the bible tells \nits adherents to obey their human governments', nothing more. That is a \nstatement of fact not opinion. The bible does say obey the governments of \nman. It is in the bible. It is fact. There is no room for interpretation, \nit is very explicit about this command.\nRomans 13:1-7 \"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. \nFor there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been \ninstituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what \nGod has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are \nnot a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one \nwho is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his \napproval, for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be \nafraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of \nGod, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one \nmust be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake \nof conscience.\"\nHow have I taken this out of context? It clearly says obey the government \nor else.\n\n\"By YOUR RATIONAL Christians should sacrifice their children to satan if \nthe government says so.\" No, if the government told us to kill children, \nthen you and I will remove our concent to be governed. Without the popular \nconcent of the people it governs a government ceases to exist. At that \npoint we institute a new government. This may or may not involve bloodshed \nbut would only be disobeying government if the majority of the governed \nadhered to this command. This hypothetical is facetious. It would never \nhappen. Even if it did, by removing your consent to be governed and \ninstituting or trying to institute a new government you are obeying the new \ngovernment that has your consent to govern you. If you are going to use a \nhypothetical please use reasonable scenarios.\n\n\"You're an intellectual whore; borrowing from this or that to prove your \npoint with no basis in context; just like you're accusing me of.\" Please \ngive specific examples to make your case. All you have here is an \naccusation. Accusations are not proof of misconduct. I provided my \nevidence. Please provide yours.\n\n\"I build my opinions on facts. ... just like satan. Boo.\"\nSo this seems to boil down to three accusations: I am using my opinion, not \nfacts to argue, you believe in science but science doesn't know everything, \nand people want to be god. I don't see how the latter two are relevent so \nI'll ignore those. I have used several facts to support my positions and \nclaims. I told you that Mr. Bundy's grandmother did not live in the town \nnear the ranch until 1901. Unfortunately I got that wrong, as late as the \n1940 census, no Bundy's lived in Bunkerville. Bundy's maternal grand \nparents were the closest. They lived in Mesquite a few miles from \nBunkerville but never had any rights to the land Mr. Bundy is claiming he \nhas \"ancestral\" rights to. I told you that his parents bought the ranch in \n1948. This is confirmed by property records in the Clark County Recorders \nOffice as is the transfer of water rights to only the 160 acre ranch which \nprevented Mr. Bundy's parents from grazing cattle outside that area until \n1954 when they were allowed to build the wells you mentioned to water their \ncattle. These facts are also confirmed in the court documents of Mr. \nBundy's challenge to the BLM's decision to restrict 600k acres of Federal \nland to protect the desert tortoise, a case he lost. This is just a few \nfacts I gave you. You are the one who has not provided any facts. I wish \nyou would engage in a real discussion of the facts and not retreat behind \nyour opinions and biblical scriptures.

I told that you were wrong and explained why. I told you that \nyou were ignorant and I gave you information to fix that. I have said it a \nfew times. Ignorance is temporary.

I will mention the dust bowl \nagain and I will add oil spills, the reckless and fraudulent trading that \nbrought about the 2008 financial collapse, snake oil salesmen, get rich \nquick schemes, trickle down economics and the Bundy supporters.

They waited that long. Oil companies routinely fail to maintain \ntheir rigs and pipes. The Cuyahoga River has caught fire 13 times because \nof irresponsible storage of chemicals and oil. Businesses cannot be trusted \nto be responsible. The banks were selling bad mortgages to people who \nshould never have qualified and sold them knowing they were bad to \ninvestors and took out insurance on the product the knew would fail. \nDeregulation of the financial sector led to irresponsible and greedy \ndecisions to defraud investors, insurance companies and other banks. Snake \noil salesmen sold useless products with false advertisements and promises, \ndefrauding people all over the country. Today nearly every product on the \nshelves advertises things it can't provide and people believe it. Many \npeople still buy into get rich quick schemes. Ads to make money with \ngoogle, ebay, and other websites or by selling products for a company door \nto door make the scam artists a lot of money and defraud the people who \nbelieve the claims. We were sold trickle down economics during the Reagan \nera and anyone to thought about it would realize it was BS. A wealthy \nperson will spend their money sure but they only need so many cars, they \nonly eat so much food. Letting the nations wealth concentrate at the top \nwill not help everyone else because the wealthy do not spend fast enough. \nNow we are being sold the message that tax cuts will create jobs. People \ncannot be trusted to be honest and responsible. The Bundy supporters took \ntheir guns and pointed them at civil servents executing a lawful court \norder. They did not do any research into the legal case. They did not \nverify Mr. Bundy's claims. They were not responsible with their actions and \nbroke many laws in the process of protecting a lawbreaker. People are not \nresponsible. The government is very inept and I for one prefer an inept \ngovernment to an efficient one. An efficient government misused might \nactually be able to do what conspiracy theorists claim it can now. As long \nas it does what it is supposed to for the most part I will tolerate regular \nscrew ups, after all, that big bad government is made up of people but \ndespite being inept, the government, through regulation, forces people to \nbehave responsibly under threat of being forced to behave responsibly. \nStorage standards have greatly reduced the number of pollution \ncatastrophes. Safety standards have reduced work place injuries and deaths. \nBanking regulations written after the great depression prevented the sort \nof behavior that brought down the financial industry in 2008 until the were \nrepealed at the turn of the 21st century. Regulations on advertisements \nhave gotten rid of completely fraudulent claims about products and forced \nthe disclosure of ingredients for all consumable products. Other products \nmust also meet safety standards, no toys are allowed to use cheap lead \npaint. Limits on grazing and agriculture protect biodiversity and prevent \nanother dust bowl. The government is a huge help in forcing people to \nbehave responsibly. The government gets a lot of bad press for the things \nit does wrong and rarely gets any press for the things it does right. This \ncreates a distorted narrative and creates the impression that the \ngovernment can't do anything right and is irresponsible but that is far \nfrom the truth. People are free to do as they please within the boundaries \nestablished to prevent bad behavior. Your statement implies that people are \nnot free to live their lives responsibly. They are. They are not free to \nlive their lives irresponsibly. You are free to do whatever you want as \nlong as it is responsible. You are not allowed to do things that are \nirresponsible, like further drive an endangered species to extinction and \nreduce the biodiversity that our nation is dependent on to maintain our \nresources. You are not allowed to ignore the laws because you don't like \nthem. You need a better reason than you want to behave irresponsibly to \njustify breaking a law.\n\nYou said god given liberty. your god does not give you liberty the \nconstitution does but if you want to use the bible as a basis for your \ninteractions with the government, it is very consistent in saying that \nChristians should obey authority. Romans 13:1-2, 1 Peter 2:13-14,  \nEphesians 6:5-8, Colossians 3:22-25, 1 Timothy 6:1-2, 1 Peter 2:18-20, \nTitus 2:9-11. The christian god does not grant liberty but rights. The \nchristian god infact did not grant liberty to women or slaves at all and \nvery few rights. That is how you misused the word liberty. You should have \nused rights.\n\n\n\"...from your statements I can know that you are wrong and infer from that \nyou have either not read anything accurate or learned from anyone who knew \nwhat they were talking about.\" - How is that even possible in reality.\"\nMany people listen to infowars, MSNBC and FOX \"news\", the young turks, and \nmany others, all of which claim to be telling the truth but frequently get \nthe facts wrong or outright lie and misrepresent data. They also cherry \npick convenient facts when they are pushing a political agenda. If a person \nonly listens to these propagandists and believe their claim to be telling \nthe truth, then that person is listening to and reading false or incomplete \ninformation; information that is critical to coming to an accurate \nconclusion. If a person only watches MSNBC, Piers Morgan, and democrats and \naccepts what they tell that person, then that person will be wrong because \nthey have not read accurate information and listened to people who did not \nknow what they were talking about. The same is true of people who accept \nwhat FOX, infowars, and rush limbaugh say. These are propagandists. They \nare all liars. They are professionals. Their only goal is to promote an \nextreme political agenda. They are not in the business of presenting news, \ninformation and facts. For that you need to go to the source. Experts, \nprofessional journal articles, and real news organizations like the \nassociated press. Stay away from foreign government outlets like Al \nJazeera, RT and the BBC. They, like American propagandists, only present \nthe views of their respective governments.\n\nSlander is stated Libel is written. This is a written forum. You should \nhave used the word Libel. That doesn't normally matter but this is a \ndiscussion about law and the distinction between the two has a lot of legal \nimportance so I thought I would point that out.\n\n\"So what's the point, two legs bad fourth reich good?\"\nWhen did I mention anything related to germany? Why did you? This makes no \nsense.\n\"You're using social studies rational?\" You are misusing the word rational. \nSocial studies is a topic not a concept. This is akin to saying gun control \nrational or abortion rational. Rational as a noun is a body of logic and \nreason; as an adjective it means that something is reasonable or of sound \nlogic. My background in history helps me a great deal in coming to rational \nconclusions but it is not a source of reason itself.\n\"Sociological rational?\" This isn't even a whole sentence. Look up \nsociological. It is misused here.\n\"Historical - scientific - empirical rational?\" These are different types \nof rationals if they rely solely on either historical events, scientific \ntheory and facts, or experimental data. Because this is not a whole \nsentence I do not know what you were trying to say with this.\n\"What, I'm asking for real, does your opinion satisfy - besides your \npersonal edifice?\" This is an incorrectly structured sentence and I do not \nunderstand what you are asking.

I apologize to any \nMasons and Transhumanists who were offended. I came closer than I possibly \nshould have on a couple occasions but nothing I said about anyone other \nthan the Masons and Transhumanists was belittling.\nMirriam-Webster: Belittle: to describe (someone or something) as little or \nunimportant.\nI did not say that anyone or anything, excepting the two aforementioned \ngroups, as unimportant or as small. Everything I have said is accurate. The \nclosest I came, excepting the prior two groups, to belittling anyone was \nimplying that many people either did not pay attention during social \nstudies or had forgotten the information from their social studies class. \nThat would be belittling if it weren't true. You can google how poorly \namericans on the street do when asked basic questions about history and \ngovernment. Sadly, too many cannot even name the 3 branches of government. \nI am not belittling anyone when I point out facts that make a person or \ngroup look ignorant. Accusing someone or a group of not doing research, \neven if I add that they should have, and of being wrong is not the same as \nbelittling them. If you have not noticed, I am a very literal person. I do \nmy best to adhere to the established definitions of words and I say what I \nmean. I reject the attempts by anyone to redefine words to suit a political \nagenda and rile emotions. When I call Mr. Bundy an Anarchist, I am saying \nthat he fits the definition. Again, Miriam-Webster: anarchist: a person who \nrebels against any authority, established order, or ruling power\n2:  a person who believes in, advocates, or promotes anarchism or anarchy; \nespecially :  one who uses violent means to overthrow the established order\nI came close to belittling my countrymen when I wrote, \"This is immature \nand childish behavior.\" when referring to the anti-government advocates but \nI understand it to be true and I provided the justification for that \nstatement with, \"The primary evidence of maturity is the ability to forego \nsatisfaction in favor of something better later, comprehension.\" I will say \nit again, children want some small satisfaction now and cannot seem to wait \nfor something better down the road. They have not developed that ability \nyet. Similarly, it seems that unless anti-government advocates get what \nthey want when they want it and without having to do much if any work to \nget it they are not satisfied. That is evidence of a lack of maturity. \nGrowing old is mandatory, not growing up. Not every adult is mature, sadly.\nI do not know what you have read or who you have learned from but from your \nstatements I can know that you are wrong and infer from that you have \neither not read anything accurate or learned from anyone who knew what they \nwere talking about.\nCalling you a jerk or a dumbass would be name calling. I have not called \nyou a derogatory name, not once. I have accused you of misusing the English \nlanguage.\nThe words you misused are, in this order: Lawful, Liberty, Rights, Order, \nLiberty again, Renegade, and Slander. There were also a lot of grammatical \nerrors but only one sentence that failed to still make sense so I'll ignore \nthat. Given that list of misused words, I feel it is accurate to accuse you \nof misusing words and, because of how you used the words, of attempting to \nredefine words.\n\"Your position is that, if I don't agree with you - I'm this or that name.\" \nAgain, I never called you any names, others have but not me."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/user/dhermitmorse", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "dhermitmorse", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133jrijfx2bvbmmr232evqbdkjzgvrqs04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-01T14:56:38.614Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeWcOJuPWdnR6tqbiregEIg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.18762999999999996, "formal_score": 97, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-05-01T14:56:38.614Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110860160407384907609", "textDisplay": "+Scot Watson\nAnd yet ignores the fact that he would owe the state of Nevada 3.5 million \ndollars because the state of Nevada has a grazing fee of 15.50 per head per \nmonth while the federal government has a rate of 1.38 per head per month \nand the Nevada State Constitution ceded the lands to the Federal \nGovernment.

If Joe robs every business in his \ncity, but he misses one or one business is armed and refuses to be robbed, \nwould you claim that that business is cheating or being unfair because they \nrefused to be robbed?\nD.) It's not about the tortoise, if it WAS about the tortoise why did the \ngovernment euthanize 800+ of these turtles when they shut down the turtle \nconservation center due to lack of funding.\nE.) about the money, the government spent more money killing and taking the \ncattle away and on this whole debacle than the bundies owed, and more than \nit cost to run the tortoise center. Why would the government spend more \nmoney rounding up cattle than the bundies owe if it were about the \ntortoises? when just the year before they killed 800 of them? It's clearly \nabout power you dont shut down a center because you lack funds, then \nsomehow spend about 10x that amount to harass a rancher.\nF.) do we have any evidence that the cattle endanger the tortoises? didnt \nhundreds of thousands of buffalo run through there before? did that \nendanger the tortoise? \nG.) how come we should trust the government to preserve animals when they \nhave an abysmal track record of doing so successfully in their attempts in \nthe past?\nH.) people were shot over and over again in the \"wild wild west\" is largely \na myth\nI.) bundy threatened violence? How do you think laws are enforced? taxes \ncollected? with threats of violence, pay up, obey, or else men with guns \nwill show up and FORCE you to comply, arrest you, take your stuff etc. So \nto be correct in this manner, the BLM threatened violence, bundy and his \nmilitia buddies simply showed that just a threat of violence wasnt enough \nto make them comply with their edicts anymore. that actual aggressive \nviolence was needed by the government to make them comply. \nJ.) It's incredibly ironic that you say that bundy unilaterally decided the \nmatter because he had guns. considering the government who claims they own \nland just because they said so, in government courts. If I said I owned \nyour house (despite the fact that you built it) but i'm letting you live \nthere because I'm nice, then 5 years later I say you owe me $500 a month \nfor it and you say no because it's not REALLY my house and then I declare, \nin a court that I own and operate that it REALLY IS my house and then I \nsend a bunch of men with guns to your house to take your stuff because you \ndidnt pay me, and you have some of your friends with you ready to defend \nyour house.

Both \nare equally horrid.  There are also bigots in equal numbers against \nreligion, etc.  The world doesn't revolve around black people.

Additionally, the entire issue of \nonerous taxes being levied by the Feds is being challenged on \nconstitutional grounds everywhere, because so many of the taxes introduced \nsince the civil war don't meet the test of constitutionality. It should \ncome as no surprise to a learned individual such as yourself that the \nFederal authorities have not been operating according to their own legal \nguidelines for quite some time. That is why civil disobedience as \ndemonstrated in the Nevada case are so useful as precedents. By the way, \nthe local and federal authorities were never in any danger from the \npeaceful Americans assembled as is their right.

It says a great many other things. For \ninstance, the acquisition of private property for conservation efforts. One \nof the properties listed is Coyote Springs. This report was produced by \nBureau of Land Management March 2014.\n\nThey still want his land for a solar project.\n\nTo say he used the land for free is out right lie. His family built an \nmaintained water infrastructure on all his grazing land for 140+ years at 0 \nexpense to taxpayers. Not only has the cattle relied on the water \ninfrastructure for 140 years but every other animal. BLM has destroed a lot \nof that very infrastructure in the raid.\n\nBLM also shot alot of cattle. Multiple reports have been filed with PETA \nagainst the BLM abuse of the animals.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12mwj2ziq3wwfxgn04ceddj5zaifryyngw": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/user/evilmamaluigi", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Johann C.

If you \ngo somewhere its either where we live or nature and not some phony made up \nplace to suck money out of your pocket.\n\nTo begin with you need to consider what you want to see when you come here. \nThe country is extremely diverse for being so tiny. There are allot of \nurban areas and large cities to the south and some in the middle part. Most \nof the museums and cultural stuff is also located in the south and middle \nparts (since that area is more hospitable). In the south there are large \nfields and open areas as well. If you come to the middle parts you will see \nmuch more forests composing mostly of leaf trees towards the south and \ntransitioning into evergreens to the north. To the north and along the \nborder with Norway we got allot of mountains and ski resorts during winter.\n\nThere are allot of undisturbed nature in the middle parts however to the \nnorth there are HUGE areas without people and some exceptionally beautiful \nlandscapes. There are plenty of fresh water springs as well and pretty much \nall water in Sweden be it from toilets to fresh water springs are world \nclass drinking water. Granted there are places in the south with poor by \ncomparison. The weather is usually good during high summer but while its a \nlovely period with temperatures of 25*C or above its rather short and both \nautumn and spring can be very cloudy with brief rain now and then.\n\nDuring high summer the sun depending on where you are can shine during the \nnight leading to very short \"nights\" and light around the clock. During \nwinter the opposite is true where the sun only appears a short time however \nthe white snow usually means that the moonlight is bright enough to allow \nyou to see during the night anyway. We also have the occasional Aurora if \nyou are in the mid and more commonly in the north.\n\nAllot of people come here to spend a few weeks during the summer because \nits so lovely so there are plenty of property to rent for tourists. I would \npersonally rent a summer cottage someplace semi remote. I do not recommend \ndiving because of the poor visibility in our sea but boats can be fun. \nOtherwise you can enjoy living very near to nature without too much worries \nthat it will kill you. We only have one dangerous snake and its still \nperfectly survivable and the same goes for the spiders (Though seeking \nmedical attention is still advisable).\n\nThere are allot of mushrooms and berries freely available in the nature and \nby Swedish law you are allowed to trespass in nature, pick flowers, berries \nand mushrooms (just stay away from endangered flowers, there should be a \nyellow sign next to them). You are also allowed to collect dry wood and \nmake camp fires at your convenience. The only real rules is \"dont be a \ndick\" so clean up after you and dont damage nature too badly. There are \nplenty of rivers to fish in but its a bit tricky to get anything worthwhile.\n\nDuring winter I would say to avoid the early parts. It takes a while before \nthe air dries up and a proper layer of snow has fallen though there are \nknown to be years without snow. There are allot of winter activities from \nthe Ice hotel in the north to ice skating (allot of publicly accessible ice \nskating spots are usually organized for children but stay off natural ice \nunless it has been inspected by professionals beforehand. With some skills \nyou can travel long distances with skis and snow mobiles are also very fun \nto operate. A suggestion would be to contact a family that owns a lovely \nplace to stay in and ask if you could live with them for a few weeks in \nexchange for some money.\n\nThere are allot of really nice people here and if you meet the right kind \nof people from the start your stay could be a lovely experience. Swedes are \nalso known to be generous so if you are a nice and open person you might be \ninvited to some nice BBQ or something.\n\nAnyway I have talked too much."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108374775456899879537", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ah41542", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133j5szpxnrudmkz23nhrkjctj2jhmcs", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-19T10:35:44.184Z", "likeCount": 0, "sentiment_score": 0.55972200000000005, "formal_score": 7, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-19T10:35:44.184Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108374775456899879537", "textDisplay": "+Das Neko Understood. \n\nSo tell me, If I visit Sweden, what would you suggest as the highlights?
