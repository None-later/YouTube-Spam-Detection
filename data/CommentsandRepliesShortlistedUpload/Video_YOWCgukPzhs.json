I love my \ncountry, but I will not allow someone who has a biased opinion deliberately \nalter history to suite their narrative whether they really believe it \nor not. With Dinesh I believe it to be a case of over \"educated\" and under \nintelligent.

The host of this video comically calls communists \n\"progressives\", stinkweed by any other name. What we see here is an attempt \nto discredit American history by claiming the communist rewriting our \nhistory. As expected, RT (American communist propaganda under the guise of \nbeing a news media) comments is full of the usual communist rhetoric. I \ncall communism The Liars Philosophy, it's not just a practice, but a way of \nlife. The great liars of our species calling anyone who opposes their dogma \nliars is just one of many mind games they play.\n\nFor a long time I've been puzzled by the American inaction to confront the \ncommunist progress (that's the real leftist progressive) in breaking down \nAmerica from within. Every aspect of the American way of life has been \nviciously attacked. Yet interestingly this massive infiltration constantly \nfaces an invisible wall that keeps them from completely taking over. Even \nthe attempt to establish a police state militarizing law enforcement ran \nhead-on into that invisible wall. Every attempt by communists to trigger a \ndomestic conflict has failed miserably. So what is that invisible wall? It \nis the profoundly deep seeded American spirit. Unlike communist \nrevolutionaries, American revolutionaries are very patient, very self \ndisciplined and extraordinarily intelligent. Of course the Reds on this \ncomments will inevitably mock what I say, that's their mentality.\n\nAmericans are so strong that we don't fear descent, even the insane hatred \nfrom communists. The part of the documentary interviewing Prof. Ward \nChurchill shows just how insane communists are, with his stating nucking \nAmericans is justified. Let's see, Hitler killing around 6 million Jews is \nbad and killing 2 or 3 times that with Americans is good? Having a lot of \nexperience with communists in America and Europe, the most disturbing thing \nis their advocating violent revolution and mass murder. Fortunately, \ncommunists are very poor fighters, a lot of emotion and no brains. When \nAmericans finally get fed up with all this communist infiltration, the \nrenovation of our government and society will be applied very smoothly. \nThere will be some communist armed resistance, but that won't last long.\n\nIt's wonderful to see, especially an immigrant, show the true America. It's \nalso very satisfying to see communists squeal like little piggies. I think \nwhat is happening with allowing communists a free hand to cause so much \ndestruction is because American Democracy must be given a boost in learning \nand growing. Our democracy must evolve philosophically, morally and \nsocially. It can't do that if we remain comfortable. When all this \ncommunist destruction reaches a point where Americans become very \nuncomfortable, then we can breath new life into our democracy and way of \nlife. At that point we will see the beginning of the end to communism and \ntyrants, not just in America, but all over the world. And all the videos on \nYouTube won't affect it.\n\nThomas\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12hxh4bqwvetbbmp23tsf0bpsuuyrdqg04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCowGlTGH-rv1W428KPgVI7w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ali pada john", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-29T23:15:12.522Z", "videoId": "YOWCgukPzhs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCowGlTGH-rv1W428KPgVI7w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.24779400000000001, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-10-29T23:15:12.522Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108800788761333248300", "textDisplay": "Dinesh D'Souza is a half liar and a half Indian.

Since that time, government has been closing the fist and \ntaking rights.... Remember, we are talking about freedom, not equality \nwhich was a complicated issue that took some time to work out.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s ludicrous. Blacks were not completely free. Women were not \ncompletely free. Neither could vote, and in many if not most places women \ncouldn\u2019t even own land. I\u2019m under the impression Amerinds didn\u2019t have \nrights either. Moreover, the rights enshrined under the Bill of Rights \nweren\u2019t applicable to state laws, and in fact many had restrictions on \nreligion, for example. Post colonial America was rife with rules and \nrestrictions.  \n\n\n\u201cWhere do you think those preferences came from and do they require 100% \nconsensus? How does a state 'make up its mind'? Its called majority rule \nwhich is decided by individuals.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a rather simplistic view of the mess that is American government. \nBut to address it on its own terms, those preferences change, and wrt gay \nmarriage have changed. In fact wrt most of the liberal ideas I\u2019ve been \nmentioning have changed.\n\n\u201cWe started out talking about individualism when you made the claim that \nindividuality was the cause of our failed education system and I'm still \ntalking about that concept.\u201d\n\nOh, no, I didn\u2019t claim that, I guessed it. I have no idea why our education \nsystem is worse than other countries. I\u2019m guessing it might have to do with \ncultural norms, and just picked the most likely norm we have that\u2019s \ndifferent.\n\n\u201cInheritance and visitation rights don't require a legal marriage to \nmanage, there are other ways to attain those rights so they aren't \nexclusive to marriage. Also, you post pretty long comments for someone who \ndoesn't  \"care to delve into it on Youtube\".\u201d\n\nYes, and I\u2019m trying not to get longer. Whether there are other ways is \nirrelevant- I\u2019m talking about the establishment of a family unit and what \nit entails. Marriage is the formation of a new family. That\u2019s its most \nimportant aspect.\n\n\u201cHow can you separate rights and freedoms anyway?

I think I can give some examples of what i mean though. \n\nI am not arguing for conservatism by the way, I don't think along the lines \nof partisans but I believe freedom is tantamount to sacrosanct. To say that \nwe have more freedoms today may not be as accurate as some think. The \nPATRIOT ACT comes to mind. You can be labeled a 'terrorist' for your \nideology now and we definitely don't have the 'freedom from fear' that FDR \nspoke of. 'Free speech zones' are relatively new as well. Privacy is \neffectively out the window with NSA technology, drones patrolling, etc. The \nNDAA has elements that eliminate due process. Property rights are under \nattack more than any time in American history. Hell, you can't even buy \npaint with lead in it, chose your preferred light bulb, buy food with trans \nfats in some states, chose not to have health insurance, collect rainwater, \nand i won't even start on the firearms issue or Codex Alimentarius or the \nFederal land and water grab going on as we speak.\n\nAs far as birth control, that is a positive right. A right that is \ncontingent on another individual's action. Should a woman be able to force \na given doctor to provide her with contraceptives? Only if she invented it \nwould she have a genuine right to it. Positive rights are actually \nentitlements and can conflict with each other while negative rights can not \nas they do not require any action from another individual and do not come \nfrom mankind.\n\nWhen you speak of black rights to vote or gay rights to marry, those are \nalso positive rights. In an individualist society you don't gain or lose \nrights by becoming or ceasing to be gay. The marriage issue is purely about \nrecognition from the state in the form of subsidies, you can't force people \nto accept it nor can you force gays to stop being gay. Collectivism has \nallowed groups to oppress individuals even in America, unfortunately. And \nthe individual is the smallest minority of them all.\n\nThe 14th amendment actually just created a second class citizenship for \nblacks instead of the Citizenship whites had until the 16th amendment made \nus all second class citizens. Its a complicated issue. Supreme court \ndecisions have been intended to take rights from individuals but Marbury \nvs. Madison has yet to be overruled and any unconstitutional amendment or \ndecision is null and void (granted there is an honest judge involved).\n\nRemember, thoughts are individually constructed, not collectively. Who \nexactly does the collective serve? There are individual people working \ntogether to achieve individual goals and fulfill individual plans but \nsociety doesn't act or have preferences, per se. Only individuals do.

But \nthere\u2019s lots of evidence against that notion.\n\n\u201cThink freedom of speech....and think how group rights can take away from \nthose individual rights. Political correctness is one example\u201d\n\nNot so much a conservative boogeyman as much as an equal liberal reaction \nto such conservative offenses in the past. Even now, conservatives practice \npolitical correctness as much or more than liberals. It\u2019s just their PC \nhinges on things like the so-called war on Christmas. Meanwhile, freedom of \nspeech as a right has gained in the past decades. To take one example, porn \nis now widely available and has been found to be protected under free \nspeech grounds. This happened in the Flynt case in the ?70s[iirc]. And \nconservatives have tried again and again to overturn this. Note also \nconservatives attempts to censor the internet in the 90s, and free speech \nexpanded to include that as well.\nSo you seem to be arguing that widespread condemnation and private business \nreaction to some remarks made by Donald Sterling somehow reduces individual \nrights but the examples I mention don\u2019t expand them greater than ever \nbefore?... No, I\u2019m inferring that because you\u2019ve yet to actually mention \nexamples.\n\n\u201cAs for global warming, i was saying that your assertion that it is man \nmade is conjecture.\u201d\n\nWhich I thought was a ridiculous assertion and treated it as such. \nScientists look at evidence and come up with the most likely explanation. \nThat\u2019s what manmade global warming is- the best guess. Calling it \nconjecture minimizes the large amount of evidence supporting it. To date, \nno alternative offered by deniers has any substantial evidence to back it \nup.

With any of them that we have \nto downsize into the private sector, put them to work rebuilding our \ninfrastructure. Another thing is stop sending our money overseas to other \ncountries. Trade with them, but stop trying to buy their friendship. I'm \nnot even running for President, but I'm smart enough to know what we can do \nto straighten this country back out.\n\nBut the key is....finding some honest people to implement these plans and \nnot sell out or get scared when the death threats begin. I know these \nthings would work, but we have too many crooks, liars and thieves to ever \nhave a chance at getting it done. So good bye America, RIP.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12tgj0bctrwwti0a23ostgwjzimtbfdn": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK_ewhavgMasE1SgoxtZM0A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-I_ncHBsE_Jg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGw/H3Kr-DZElEc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "1BlubeTube", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-02T21:52:05.634Z", "videoId": "YOWCgukPzhs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCK_ewhavgMasE1SgoxtZM0A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.82569389999999998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-11-02T21:52:05.634Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114700550744673242995", "textDisplay": "I thought Thom Hartmann was going to take apart Dinesh D'Souza?

If you \nthink socialism works better, I cite Venezuela, where you can't buy milk at \nthe grocery store because it's not worth it to produce it. I know that Mr. \nHartmann is not propagating true socialism/communism, but heavy tariffs are \nno minor encroachment on the free market. The World Bank has said that if \nall such tariffs were eliminated, global economy would expand by $800B. \nHere is how it works:\n\nImpose a tariff > foreign economy must decrease output to cope with lower \ndemand > foreign economy experiences downturn due to lowered employment.\n\nALSO: people's disposable income decreases due to high price of domestic \nproduct/unavailability of cheaper foreign product > obvious decrease in \nconsumer spending because people have had to use up more money on the \ndomestic product > poor economic effect.\n\nI have been fortunate enough to receive a college business education. I \nwill inform you that I learned all of this in my first semester of \nuniversity.

They are gossips,\nslanderers, God-haters, arrogant, proud, boastful, inventors of evil, \ndisobedient to parents, undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, and \nunmerciful.\nAlthough they know full well God's just sentence-that those who practice \nsuch things deserve to die-they not only do them, but even applaud others \nwho practice them.\"\n-\nRead that word by word by word; this is God's assessment of ALL of mankind \nin his fallen condition; name a person who is not on this list multiple \ntimes and compare that list to Webster's definition of a sociopath or \npsychopath and then you know that 1) God does know mankind and 2) you \nbetter be reconciled to one so powerful He created everything with a word \nand ex-nihilo \"out of nothing\" and does not tolerate sin.\ufeff"}},

Of \ncourse, complete unanimity is hardly ever possible, and every once in a \nwhile there have been some deviations from the straight and narrow path.  \nAlmost always, those deviations have reflected not a disagreement with the \nfundamental message of Adam Smith, not a disagreement that in a perfect \nworld free trade would be the best of all possible courses of action, but \nthey have tended to reflect special circumstances of the time. \n\nPerhaps the most famous deviation was by the most noted, and some would say \nnotorious, of the modern economists, John Maynard Keynes - the English \neconomist who gave his name to the Keynsian Revolution.  In 1931, in the \ncourse of the Depression, Keynes, who had been a free trader all his life, \ncame out in some articles in Britain, in favor of departing from free trade \nand of introducing tariffs.  He did so not because he thought that was in \nand of itself the best policy, but because he thought the best policy was \npolitically unfeasable.  In his view, the right policy for Britain at that \ntime was to go off the gold standard, end a fixed exchange rate, allow the \npound sterling to be a free market currency whose price would be determined \nin the market as it now is, of course, in today's world of floating \nexchange rates. \n\nBut Keynes, an economist, made the political judgement that it was not \npolitically feasible for Britain to go off the gold standard.  Tariffs are \nan alternative to devaluation.  Afterall, it comes roughly to the same \nthing if on the one hand the price of the pound sterling was changed from \nthe $4.80 which then was the price, to let's say $4.00, that would make \nBritish goods cheaper to foreigners, foreign goods more expensive to \nBritain, and in that way would redress the problem of the balance of \npayments they were facing.  That's one way to do it and the best way.  But \nhe thought that was politically unfeasible and it comes to the same thing \nto introduce a tariff on imports and a subsidy to exports.  That's an \nindirect and concealed form of devaluation.  So Keynes came out for that \nconcealed form. \n\nHis political judgement was like that of many economists, flawed, and about \n3 weeks after he came out for a tariff on these grounds, Britain went off \nthe gold standard.  I may say that this is not an isolated story.  Time and \nagain, in my opinion, economists have erred when they have proposed 2nd \nbest solutions in the area where they are experts, namely economics, \nbecause of predictions they make about political feasibility in an area \nwhere they are not experts. \n\nAt any rate, Keynes had a very flexible mind.  And one week after Britain \nwent off the gold standard he retracted his support for tariffs.  He \npublished an article saying, \"now that we've gone off the gold standard \nthere is no longer any point to tariffs.  I return to my free trade \nprinciples.\"  But later, when he reprinted that retraction in a book of \nessays, he appended a very revealing footnote because it shows how much \ndamage can be done by the tendency for people to preach second best \nsolutions.  He said, \"Not all my free trade friends proved to be as \nprejudiced as I had thought.  For after a tariff was no longer necessary, \nmany of them were found voting for it.\" In other words, it's often easier \nto turn people in the wrong direction than it is to reverse that and get \nthem back in the right direction.\""}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC0Mjx5vnQ1LrkME_LCybvQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Fantasy Guru", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z132gh4jerzszj2zj04cijuw4pjkjlzh3mo0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-25T09:23:54.376Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCC0Mjx5vnQ1LrkME_LCybvQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.058640000000000025, "formal_score": 52, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-25T09:23:54.376Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103272896884113668950", "textDisplay": "Friedman is one of the greatest economic minds of all time yet Liberals \nalways somehow find a way to discredit him.

His \nprescription for simply removing all national economic protections \nworldwide is ridiculous, and I suspect he knows it. While he ironically \nwhines that progressives are committing national suicide, his advice that \nwe simply drop all trade barriers, would indeed be suicidal, if our leaders \nare stupid enough to follow it.\n\n\nWe do have some years of experience with conscious policies of trade \nbarrier removal: Nafta, Gatt, etc; they spawned the whole (honorable) \nglobal citizen's movement called \"Fair Trade\" in pointed response to the \nmislabeled \"free trade agreements\", designed to sound good and obfuscate \nthe exploitative nature of the game those who negotiate our futures away \nbehind a shroud of secrecy, are really playing. \n\n\nThe modern trade agreements have been good for billionaires, and disastrous \nfor nearly everyone else. All Americans that give a shit about their \ncountry, find it alarming that we are giving our country to the oligarchs, \nwhich is exactly what it means to sign agreements kept far from the public \neye, that render our entire system of laws subject to the review and \napproval of a tribunal consisting of three un-elected representatives of \nbig business, effectively ushering in the post nation state era, in \npreference to a de-facto world government run by representatives of the \nuber-rich.\n\n\n\nThe fact is, no industrialized country has ever developed without \nprotectionism, and none ever will. The third world has a very clearly \ndefined, and very miserable, but critical role in regard to the industrial \nworld, : to provide cheap resources, human and natural, for the \nindustrialized countries (who have survived and grown strong as a direct \nresult of protectionist policies), to exploit. It is an arrangement that \nhas produced untold billions in profits, and unfathomable suffering for \nthose on the wrong end. Third world status is the best any country can hope \nfor without protectionism.  \n\n\nThe best boxers in the world were never expected to compete in the ring, \nwithout the benefit of decades of \"protectionist\" policies by their \nparents. To advise a poor nation trying to industrialize, to simply refrain \nfrom instituting any protections to allow the new industries to grow, is \nthe moral equivalent of advocating that children should go in the ring with \nworld champions, as soon as they're big enough to wear a pair of gloves and \nwave their arms around."}}]}, "z13msh3pfov0ejr4y04ccffhzyebshepliw": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vjnD2iI1Vk--wSrSwH_aw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MG7WzcMSuYc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAU0/S-QaCU-IMy4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Andrew Gulick", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-12T03:56:26.538Z", "videoId": "YOWCgukPzhs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC2vjnD2iI1Vk--wSrSwH_aw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.665856, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-07-12T04:14:53.000Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112324671004443891388", "textDisplay": "Wow, this guy wouldn't let Denesh explain anything by cutting in the middle \nof his expalination.

But the following year, as the economy was mired in recession and \nthe federal deficit was spiraling out of control, even groups such as the \nBusiness Roundtable lobbied Reagan to raise taxes.

After Clinton finished his second term with a surplus budget \nwhich was supposed to be used to pay down the national debt, W Bush stole \nthe election and then gave that surplus back to the people in the form of \ntax cuts which mostly benefited the rich. So right there tells you that the \nRepublicans have zero interest in paying off the debt.\nWhat they do care about is that 600 billion giveaway to defense, and they \nalso let go of regulations to let the Stock Market dabble in derivatives \nwhich is nothing more than gambling with junk paper instruments which \ncaused the banks and wall street to collapse under the W Bush \nadministration.

They're goal? To see corporate fascism take place. Good luck \nwith that. Open your eyes and message that gray matter between your ears \nand stop being narrow-minded.\nFor me? I hate both parties.

Those factors are responsible for enabling the mess we have today. \nAnd they all started before Obama and Bush jr. got into office, if \nanything, they helped enable the fiscal irresponsibility of congress and \ngrow the deficit yearly and nationally, exponentially, up until the present \ntime and beyond.\n\nSo you see, put aside all the bipartisan retort, and just take a stroll \nthrough legislative and national history and you'll trace it for yourself. \nBoth of these debaters made true statements, but you have to take it back \nto the origin of the problem to understand how we got here.\n\nPs: Arguably, you can also observe the District of Columbia act of 1871, \nwhich can arguably be looked at as the premise or groundwork for the modern \nindustrial era of the 1900's and now 2000's.

Not that \nBush's cuts were the best, but it explains why the Dems went along.\n\nLot wrong with your post Chris- yeah Reagan cut taxes and there was growth, \nBut Clinton raised them and we got the longest expansion in history, and \ntaxes were huge in the 50s and there was massive government injection of \ncash into the economy with the GI bill etc, and there was growth then, too. \nHigh taxes aren't the bane you think they are.\nNow, you say about the Clinton thing I just mentioned:\n\"that was only after the Republican controlled house passed a balanced \nbudget ... Clinton prolonged the recession after he raised taxes in '93. \nYou didn't get economic growth until after a balanced budget, HOuse \ncontrolled the budget\"\n\nWell, wrong. The economy started growing pretty much right after the tax \nhikes. The Republicans never balanced the budget, and there wasn't a \nbalanced budget until 2000, and that was only because Clinton vetoed the \ntax cuts the Republicans tried to pass that would have reduced revenue. The \ncapital gains cut was passed in the middle of the expansion. I don't know \nwho sold you that silly crap, but it's incorrect.\n\nOne more thing: \"Reagan did not increase the deficit, again Democrats \ncontrolled\"\nTechnically true, but Reagan would have increased the deficit- every single \nbudget he submitted- which the House ignored- was not balanced. iirc \nsome/all had more debt than the actual budgets passed."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyapjkDQjwoXYDvaO5U52yw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "milky55way2012", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134clwj1zjddlhrg04cd5ziekbixxv4nd4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-15T03:11:12.204Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCyapjkDQjwoXYDvaO5U52yw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.23229000000000005, "formal_score": 68, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-15T03:11:12.204Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114651755287903877533", "textDisplay": "+Chris Nichols\nYea they give their money to who they want...without identifying who they \nare.

What are you trying to accomplish \nby appealing to an \"authority\"?  Besides, it sounds like a lot of what you \nsaid is lifted from Dinesh's own post on FB after Hitchens died.  I'd be \ninterested to know your sources on the quote about the formidable opponent \nand the supposed buddy buddy relationship they had, preferably from someone \nother than a known liar and corrupt scumbag.  \n\nBut even if all that IS true, it does nothing, NOTHING at all to dissuade \nmy real point, which I'm afraid you kinda missed.

Yes, he debates \nmore people than just Christopher Hitchens, and he displays astonishing \nlevels of ignorance coupled with an elegant use of empty words.  No, I'm \nsorry but I do NOT respect his style.  He brushes over history in his \narguments with breathtaking alacrity and, when called out on it, he balls \nup and starts accusing, starts calling characters into question, starts \nprojecting straw men left and right about what Hartmann was arguing.

The big problem \nhas always been those who bring the bad with them.\n\nP.S. \"(Nice lift from Gould by the way\u2015that term is usually reserved for \nthe schism between science and religion, not for the schism between liking \na author and being an atheist).\"\n\nWhat was this meant to accomplish?  Yea, so what, I like to use phrases \ncoined by evolutionary biologists in my speech. You think this weakens my \nargument somehow?

Christopher also agreed with many of his stances, most \nnotably, the Iraq war. I point this out to show you how ridiculous your \nargument is. The foremost atheist of our time had political views that \ncoincided with SOME of Dinesh's views. Is Christopher Hitchens not a true \natheist because he liked Dinesh? Towards the end of Hitch's life, Dinesh \nand him frequented many bars together. It IS possible to disagree with \nsomeone and still like them in this world. I don't agree with Dinesh on \nreligion. In fact, he makes my blood boil when I watch those debates, but \ncan you not appreciate his oratory style? Yes, much of is casuistry, but \ngive credit where credit is due. He puts up a good fight. And by the way, \nthis video has nothing to do with religion, so I'm not sure where you're \ncoming from. If this video was a religious debate and I was lauding Dinesh, \nyou might have a point, but this is a totally different subject. I tend to \nagree with a lot of Dinesh's political views, as does Christopher Hitchens \nand Sam Harris. Religious nut bag or not, if somebody says or \ndoes something I agree with I'm not gonna discount it simply because they \nhave OTHER beliefs that are absurd. Take the good and leave the bad.

Most believers know that the 10 \nCommandments aren't God's moral high bar. So your question fails at its \nmost fundamental (no pun intended) level. \nThe Children of Israel were a covenant (agreement/contract) people with \nGod. He had them things. Protection, blessings, etc, but mostly He promised \nthe Messiah would come from them. All they had to do was believe. \"I'll be \nyour Good, you'll be my people\". There were no laws or commandments for \n1600 to 2400 years from Adam to Moses. (Depending on whose time line you go \nby)\n\nThey screwed up. Their backs and got themselves into slavery, you agree is \nevil, so God, kept His part of the bargain. After 400 years in captivity, \nthey had lost their faith, lost their identity and didn't believe anymore. \nGod, knowing He'd promised the Messiah would come through these people, and \nseeing them after 400 years of bondage and zero compass than barbaric \nsurvival, Gabe them some basic civil guidelines to create some civility. \n\nEveryone, EVERY BELIEVER knows that all of the 10 commandments are \"briefly \ncomprehended\" which means \"summed up\" by Loving ones neighbor. This is \nSunday School 101. Romans 13:8-10. \n\nThe 10 Commandments were never Gods moral high bar. Jesus even attacked \nthem in the Sermon on the Mount. But you would know that since you know \nthat book you hate so much so well. The 10 commandments are your moral high \nbar, then you'd be one of the ones Crucifying Jesus, because that's why \nthey did it."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFogadzGpAbrCa5YuhanZ9g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Randy French", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ouxazaqaqc1kqr04cj34inuy5e1zojjg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-14T05:59:03.234Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCFogadzGpAbrCa5YuhanZ9g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.69312200000000002, "formal_score": 28, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-14T05:59:03.234Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QC1y8iyzy_Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAI3A/R29kPtYWnDQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112415006203621711613", "textDisplay": "+Tony Fordyce my poor grammar comes from using Swype and not editing well. \nMy bad.

The Christian Church invented human rights.  It was Dutch \nPietists that first advised that each individual should be allowed to \nbelieve as they choose.  Human rights were born in the church.\" If you \ncould point me to a scriptural justification for that, we could agree that \nthe church in fact invented hospitals and the human rights. If you can't, \nthen the credit can not be given to the church, but to people who just \nhappen to be Christians.\n\nEven worst, because the human rights go directly against the Church \ndoctrine of one God and Jesus as the Son of God. So, we can basically \nconclude that those people who \"invented\" the humans rights did it despise \nthe Church, not because of it. Also, institutions like hospitals existed \nlong before Christianity, and the ancient Greek practiced democracy and \ndebated human rights.\n\n\"The earliest documented institutions aiming to provide cures were ancient \nEgyptian temples. In ancient Greece, temples dedicated to the healer-god \nAsclepius, known as Asclepieia [...], functioned as centres of medical \nadvice, prognosis, and healing.\" \"According to the Mahavamsa, written in \nthe sixth century A.D., King Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka (reigned 437 BC to \n367 BC) had lying-in-homes and hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in \nvarious parts of the country. This is the earliest documentary evidence we \nhave of institutions specifically dedicated to the care of the sick \nanywhere in the world. Mihintale Hospital is the oldest in the world.\" \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_hospitals\n\nSo, the oldest hospitals are in fact in India in the 4th to 3th BC. It \npredates Christianity for about 400 years or 700 years if you count from \nwhen Christianity was first accepted (Christianity was not accepted in Rome \nuntil the 4th century AD)."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaPaf_ez-u8INOn3vqu6sEg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Angus Stone", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ouxazaqaqc1kqr04cj34inuy5e1zojjg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-11T14:04:06.734Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaPaf_ez-u8INOn3vqu6sEg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.02770800000000001, "formal_score": 41, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-11T14:04:06.734Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2BuT74Ru4kY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/XcbNAuHB6lw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118218509383697443117", "textDisplay": "Tom, I'm so sorry.

By the \nclose of 1860 there were 246 colleges in America. Seventeen of these were \nstate institutions; almost every other one was founded by Christian \ndenominations or by individuals who avowed a religious purpose.\n\nHarvard College, 1636 - An Original Rule of Harvard College: \"Let every \nstudent be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well, the \nmain end of his life and studies is, to know God and Jesus Christ which is \neternal life, (John 17:3), and therefore to lay Christ in the bottom, as \nthe only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning.\"\nWilliam and Mary, 1691 - The College of William and Mary was started mainly \ndue to the efforts of Rev. James Blair in order, according to its charter \nof 1691, \"that the Church of Virginia may be furnished with a seminary of \nministers of the gospel, and that the youth may be piously educated in good \nletters and manners, and that the Christian religion may be propagated \namong the Western Indians to the glory of Almighty God.\"\nYale University, 1701 - Yale University was started by Congregational \nministers in 1701,\"for the liberal and religious education of suitable \nyouth\u2026to propagate in this wilderness, the blessed reformed Protestant \nreligion\u2026\"\nPrinceton, 1746 - Associated with the Great Awakening, Princeton was \nfounded by the Presbyterians in 1746. Rev. Jonathan Dickinson became its \nfirst president, declaring, \"cursed be all that learning that is contrary \nto the cross of Christ.\"\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, 1751 - Ben Franklin had much to do with the \nbeginning of the University of Pennsylvania. It was not started by a \ndenomination, but its laws reflect its Christian character. Consider the \nfirst two Laws, relating to Moral Conduct (from 1801): \"1. None of the \nstudents or scholars, belonging to this seminary, shall make use of any \nindecent or immoral language: whether it consist in immodest expressions; \nin cursing and swearing; or in exclamations which introduce the name of \nGod, without reverence, and without necessity. \"2. None of them shall, \nwithout a good and sufficient reason, be absent from school, or late in his \nattendance; more particularly at the time of prayers, and of the reading of \nthe Holy Scriptures.\"Some other colleges started before America's \nIndependence include: Columbia founded in 1754 (called King's College up \nuntil 1784), Dartmouth ,1770; Brown started by the Baptists in 1764; \nRutgers, 1766, by the Dutch Reformed Church; Washington and Lee, 1749; and \nHampton-Sydney, 1776, by the Presbyterians.\nIt may surprise many to know that the Bible was truly the first textbook. \nThe New Haven Code of 1655 required that children be made \"able duly to \nread the Scriptures\u2026 and in some competent measure to understand the main \ngrounds and principles of Christian Religion necessary to salvation.\"\na. The Bible was the central text - John Adams reflected the view of the \nfounders in regard to the place of the Bible in society when he wrote: \n\"Suppose a nation in some distant region, should take the Bible for their \nonly law-book, and every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts \nthere exhibited!\u2026 What a Utopia; what a Paradise would this region be!\" \nJohn Adams, Feb.22, 1756b. Hornbooks - Hornbooks were brought to America, \nfrom Europe, by the colonists and were common from the 1500's - 1700's. A \nhornbook was a flat piece of wood with a handle, upon which a sheet of \nprinted paper was attached and covered with transparent animal horn to \nprotect it. A typical hornbook had the alphabet, the vowels, a list of \nsyllables, the invocation of the Trinity, and the Lord's Prayer.c. \nCatechisms - There were over 500 different catechisms used in early \neducation. Later, the Westminister Catechism became the most prominent \none.d. The New England Primer - It was the most prominent schoolbook for \nabout 100 years and was used through the 1800's. It sold over 3 million \ncopies in 150 years.e. Webster's Blue-Backed Speller - First published in \n1783 it sold over 100 million copies. It was one of the most influential \ntextbooks and was based on \"God's Word.\"f. The McGuffey Readers - Written \nby minister and university professor William Holmes McGuffey, the McGuffey \nReaders \"represent the most significant force in the framing of our \nnational morals and tastes\" other than the Bible.\nWhile there were many other textbooks (especially in the 1800's), the ones \njust mentioned were some of the most important.\nEducation in Religion was central to our Founders: Benjamin Rush signer of \nthe Declaration of Independence wrote, \"\u2026the only foundation for a useful \neducation in a republic is to be laid in religion. Without this, there can \nbe no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty, and liberty is \nthe object and life of all republican governments.\" The type of education \nthat shaped our Founders character and ideas was thoroughly Christian. It \nimparted Christian character and produced honest, industrious, \ncompassionate, respectful, and law-abiding men. It imparted a Biblical \nworld-view and produced people who were principled thinkers."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFogadzGpAbrCa5YuhanZ9g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Randy French", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ouxazaqaqc1kqr04cj34inuy5e1zojjg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-10T14:57:59.329Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCFogadzGpAbrCa5YuhanZ9g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.10865199999999997, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-10T15:19:18.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QC1y8iyzy_Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAI3A/R29kPtYWnDQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112415006203621711613", "textDisplay": "+runreilly My sad friend. are you oblivious to history?

You don't have to be some diehard Stalinist to \nrecognise that.\n\nAnd he didn't \"trick black people into uncontrollable flatulence\". Here's \nthe relevant passage from Rules for Radicals:\n\n\"I suggested that we might buy one hundred seats for one of Rochester\u2019s \nsymphony concerts.  We would select a concert in which the music was \nrelatively quiet.  The hundred Blacks who would be given the tickets would \nfirst be treated to a three-hour pre-concert dinner in the community, in \nwhich they would be fed nothing but baked beans, and lots of them; then the \npeople would go to the symphony hall-with obvious consequences.  Imagine \nthe scene when the action began! The concert would be over before the first \nmovement! (If this be a Freudian slip-so be it!)\"\n\nNo word of \"hide it from the blacks so we can embarrass them\", funnily \nenough. That's because what actually happened was he openly threatened \nthe Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra with a \"fart-in\" in order to embarrass \ntheir sponsor, Kodak. He never actually went through with it, because Kodak \nrelented in their opposition to hiring black employees. It's hard to see \nhow he could have done this deceptively when he actually didn't do it at \nall. \n\nIf that's really your evidence that he \"looked down on black people\", \nthat's pretty thin and, honestly, desperate. I have to ask, though, why \nwould he be organising protests against discriminatory hiring practices in \nthe first place if he \"looked down on black people\"?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPiT5xj8SsxcQPLrDBK-G5w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "DucksDeLucks", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ws3lgqpqwjjcej22ajhawbvvnefxqa04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-28T05:40:21.396Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPiT5xj8SsxcQPLrDBK-G5w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.52560000000000007, "formal_score": 37, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-28T05:40:21.396Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113066439971117854029", "textDisplay": "+CharlesMansonVEV0 I can't prove he was a party member but he is on record \npraising the party's views.
