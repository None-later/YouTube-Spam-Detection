That's why \nguns are not the same as cars or hammers. Knives that are meant to kill \nshould similarly be banned. You are not more safe if you have a gun in your \nhands if everyone else has one too, everyone is simply collectively more in \ndanger. The level of brainwashing by pro gun activists here is depressing. \nAs a Brit I can scarcely believe this mindset, as literally no one I know \nowns a gun and no-one would even want one even if they could get one. \n\nBanning guns or knives would not stop crime or stop people being murdered. \nI live in the UK and people still die from both. The point is that if you \nhave far fewer guns, less people can get a hold of them and keep hold of \nthem long enough to kill.

Maybe there needs to be a \npsychological test that one passes before they are allowed to bare arms.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13qhvjzjzq3ffezt04ccza4vvbpuxtqrpw0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQO5L7MjNb5VZStIFRQJF_Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Qqzd2PgVmw8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/UvmumN30UCQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "1p6t1gms", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-07T14:13:13.691Z", "videoId": "664f0INxNbM", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQO5L7MjNb5VZStIFRQJF_Q"}, "sentiment_score": 0.93220380000000003, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-06-07T14:13:13.691Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103392985733754492748", "textDisplay": " Art Vandelay says: \u201cshut your pie hole, baby factory\u201d\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12xgr45fo3fixer304cebionvusyn1hhpo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 34, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwZ2Ky_FiewdGb2NEYY_OA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "yjalma", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-25T03:30:48.746Z", "videoId": "664f0INxNbM", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCiwZ2Ky_FiewdGb2NEYY_OA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.85334019999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-05-25T03:30:48.746Z", "likeCount": 43, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116742691955344949556", "textDisplay": "some rich white kid who was rejected by women decided to go and kill people \nand the nra is responsible????\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIRPCuF2miQY3QHC5MtJTTw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Michael Anderson", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xgr45fo3fixer304cebionvusyn1hhpo0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-28T04:57:39.171Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCIRPCuF2miQY3QHC5MtJTTw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.60854800000000009, "formal_score": 38, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-05-28T04:57:39.171Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HKHEqghRCUU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/6uwraKpeMcA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104435711041857014702", "textDisplay": "+Lexi Lee that is only one clause of the amendment.

However, \nI find it unusual that he only focuses on the deaths that occurred by using \na gun, and has chosen to use his son's death as a platform to further a \npolitical agenda that wants to strip gun ownership rights from law abiding \ncitizens.  Let us not forget, the murderer of his son also stabbed several \npeople to death and used his car as a weapon as well. Should we ban all \nautomobiles and knives too?  After all, there more automobile related \ndeaths in the U.S. each year in comparison to deaths attributed to legally \nowned firearms.\n\nIf guns were not on planet earth, would his son still be alive?  I highly \ndoubt it.  As the murderer of his son and history proves, a knife or an \nautomobile can serve equally well as a murder weapon.  If someone wants to \nkill, they will kill regardless of the type of weapons available. Timothy \nMcVeigh killed 168 people with a rental truckload of modified \nfertilizer.

Most of \nCalifornia's politicians are trying to make it near impossible and \nimpractical to use a weapon to protect yourself and those around you.

The laws in place are already stacked \nagainst you that if you don't meet a specific criteria in a situation, you \ncan go to prison for rightfully saving your own life. Look at the rules \nthat armed security guards have to follow. I'm a licensed security officer \nand let my exposed firearm permit expire, because for my to legally protect \nmyself, I have to nearly be shot first to even pull a firearm out of the \nholster, where a police officer just has to presume his/her life MAY be in \ndanger.\n\n\"They talk about gun rights, but what about the right to live?\"\n\nDo you honestly believe that this kid gave a damn about people's right to \nlive? As with any homicidal person, their goal is to deny people's their \nright to live to satisfy their own desires (to kill).\n\n\"Stop this madness! We don't have to live like this!\"\n\nYou can't regulate a person's intentions. If someone wants to kill you, \nthey will find a means to try to achieve that goal. The War on Terror \nshould have been a lesson that no matter how many terrorists you kill, you \ncan't kill an idea.\n\nLastly, you can say \"let the police handle it\" or depend on the police for \nyour safety. That's your right, but it's idiotic to pass the responsibility \nof your own life and personal safety to the hands of a few strangers. And \nthe police' job is not to protect lives. Their job is to protect property \nand enforce the law. If their job was to protect the lives of citizens, \nthen we would all be in barbed wired refugee camps with the police on the \noutside waiting for a threat from afar. Get it together people. Your safety \nfor your life starts with you. Not some rich politician in a suit. Not a \nhandful of law enforcement officers patrolling an entire city.\n\nYou can pass the most strictest of laws in the history of mankind. Truth of \nthe matter is that when someone wants to kill, they always find a way. The \nbest you can do to minimize this is to arm yourselves.

Get rid of weapons everything \nwill go down hill from there. \n\nMaybe we will all learn one day. When all of humanity will have to come \ntogether as a whole if there's ever a catastrophic event. Maybe then we \nwill learn to stand together. Till then, lets all argue with each other and \nblame inanimate objects that are not at fault for our flaws.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12vvrizrsuwxtwa504cjjqx2s2ue1gj4ss0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJKiL4tRlW7rviTvtsNvqew", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4rurK8i-jWk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACY/s61VrVZ0xLM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Blasian Baby", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-31T20:19:26.661Z", "videoId": "664f0INxNbM", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJKiL4tRlW7rviTvtsNvqew"}, "sentiment_score": -0.77855000000000008, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-05-31T20:19:26.661Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100949708252094643206", "textDisplay": "This lame excuse for a \"father\" is a total moron.

Out of about 240 \nmassacres, 173 were shootings, 60 were stabbing/blunt \nforce/strangulation/fire/other, and 9 were a combination of shooting and \nsome other form of lethal force. In England where guns are pretty much \nbanned, knives, hammers and other lethal weapons are used more frequently \nnow. The murder rate has went down in UK and the USA.\n\nI couldn't get a specific number, but the murders in UK that used knives or \nblunt force are far and away more prevalent than murders that used guns. \nKnives and blunt weapons have replaced guns. The UK has been increasing \nrestrictions on knives, bats, hammers, etc. but it has had little impact on \nmurders or violent crime.\n\nThe UK murder rates are statistically far lower than the USA, but the UK \nuses only murders that have a legal conviction. For example, Dr Harold \nShipman was convicted of 172 murders that occurred over a two decade \nperiod. Everyone knew those victims were murdered, but the murders did not \ncount UNTIL Shipman was convicted THEN all 172 murders were lumped into one \nyear. The USA counts murders whether or not the murderer is found; \ntherefore, the USA murder rates will look much higher than the UK. I don't \nknow what the comparable murder rate truly is in the UK, but it is much, \nmuch higher than reported.\n\nWhen comparing statistics between two countries, it is impossible to get \naccurate reports. Different definitions of crime and differing \nmethodologies cannot produce accurate comparisons.\n\nIn the U.S. the place with by far the most restrictive gun control is the \nDistrict of Columbia. It also has the highest gun murder rate of any place \nin the USA. The gun ban in D.C. has been lifted; consequently, the murder \nrate is at its lowest point since in 1976 when the gun ban was first \nenacted. However, it still remains as the place with the highest gun murder \nrate and still has the most restrictive gun laws.\n\nLet me do a more apples to apples comparison with States within the USA. \nAccording to the Brady Campaign, the state with the most restrictive gun \ncontrol laws is California, yet that state has the highest gun murder rate \n(3.25 gun murders per 100,000 people). According to the Brady Campaign, the \nstate with the least restrictive gun control laws is Utah, yet that state \nhas the lowest gun murder rate (.97 gun murders per 100,000 people).\n\nThat was a long ass response, but wanted to give you some numbers to think \nabout. If you can dispute those or put those in a perspective that would \nsupport more gun control, then I would like to hear that.
