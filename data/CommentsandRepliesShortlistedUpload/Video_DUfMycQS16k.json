You have to make \nover 250,000/year for significant tax changes. There are plenty of hit jobs \nfloating online, but 16% higher is BS.\n\n\nAlso you seem to lack an understanding of how areas hire teacher in uni and \ncollege. Courses have a limited class count, when it fills it is simply \nclosed to enroll. Theirs no obligation to expand it, when courses lack \nenough student they are also closed, there is a minimum to them. \n\nIn university it is competitive, they only pick the best offer not stuff \nclasses for anyone they find. The free part is tuition you still pay for \ntools, equipment, dorms, food, lockers, parking, books and on field \ntraining. \n\nAlso if you expand classes, as you mentioned that would also create more \nteaching job, if it expands more then more space would be needed meaning \nmore jobs for construction workers, and land. When the uni/college expand \ncampuses, jobs would be given to teachers, aides, secretaries, IT for \ndatabases increase, purchase of new computers, furniture and, cooks for the \ncafeteria, janitor, utilities, more cable line, Internets, telephone \ncompanies, security guards, and food contracts, for vending machines and \ncafeteria ingredients. This means more jobs and profits for several \nindustries.\n\nAlso more money contracts for businesses selling books, computers, \ncalculators, teaching software, and people can get paid for web development \nof the new campus. this create a stimulus effect on the economy. Also less \nstudent loans means more money spent on the economy, meaning a \nredistribution of money.\n\nIf people fall low enough to get food stamps guess who has to shoulder that \nburden tax payers, so would you shoulder the burden for food stamps or \npeople getting a better job?\n\n  The wealthiest already have option to avoid taxes to begin with, due to \ninvestment tax rates being lower then income tax rates, plus shell \ncompanies and offshore tax havens. Do you read the panama papers? So the \nburden for middle class already exists. That's why the proposal of raising \nminimum wage, and closing those loopholes that allow tax shelters. Because \nthe wages are not catching up to inflation, therefore the trickle down \neconomics, are not allowing enough liquid money into the economy. In \nprocess they are going through a virtual recession in terms of purchase \npower, the absence of velocity of money is making the middle class shrink \nalready.\n\nIt's fine and all to nitpick here and there, but that in itself is a \nfallacy as everything must be looked at through a macroeconomics \nperspective, because everything affects each other.\n\nEven Clinton has money laundering to avoid taxes.

That is a misnomer. I have been a \nBernie supporter since day 1, but the two party system does not allow for \nthird party votes in the presidential election. Being idealistic at that \nmoment usually causes bad things to happen. \n\nReal progressivism occurs outside of the elections anyway. Alternative \nenergy, hammering on crappy corporations, reducing systemic waste in our \nsociety. Believe me, I have pounded the pavement and picked up the phone \nmany, many times. I have been a registered member of the Green Party and I \nspent most of my life as a registered independent--I registered to vote as \na Democrat so that I could vote for people like Bernie, not so that I could \ntoe the blue line--as it were.\n\nReal progressivism happens at the local level. I sat a committee for a year \nthat transformed 405 acres of land into public open space (at no cost to \nthe taxpayer, by the way). Hard work. I got yelled at by townspeople (See \nMud Lake Open Space in Nederland).\n\nEven though I am a non smoker, I helped campaign for the legalization of \npot. My online business is designed to undermine the bullshit that is the \nreal estate sales world (see sellersecondopinion.com). The online class \nwon't be up for about four more weeks, but my stated goal is to save \nhomeowners billions and to educate them about shoddy financial practices \n(see \"The Refinance Racket\")\n\nFight for Bernie while the fight is there. If he concedes, then take the \nnext best alternative and pick the best fight for you locally.\n\nPresidential politics is just what it is--a limited framework for change. \nIt sucks, but more often than not the presidential vote is more about \nholding the line.\n\nHolding the line is not towing the line. Playing defense is as important \nwhen the other guy has the ball--that is just reality.\n\nMoving forward occurs elsewhere. More significant actions occur with how we \nwork, how we raise our kids and so on. Go read my book if you think that I \nam not up for a fight.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJustin"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFgyO-1onB2XD_Ai2p9ilPA", "inappropriate_score": 0.8, "authorDisplayName": "ICantGetCrabs", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13kwti5zu2xjhuxt04cdl2gupejtja4cd0", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-03T23:35:43.361Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCFgyO-1onB2XD_Ai2p9ilPA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9565664, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-03T23:35:43.361Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uR-02KOjlaI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADw/_8GBo7_R47A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101268998669126363418", "textDisplay": "+Justin Chipman Perhaps you just \"Settle\" when you should fight for \nprogressive ideals... That \"Settling\" shit has been happening over 30 years \nand nothing has happened in that time that true progressives want at all.\n\nYou must fight with your vote not to give in and fall inline for the \n\"Establishment\" Nominee they must earn that vote not feel beholden to it \nbecause the other clown could wreck the country like a Texting Drunk Driver \nin a Conniption fit over their Mistress got pregnant with another man and \nthey feel betrayed.\n\nYou either tow the line for the DNC and all it's massive failures.\nOr you do not and we force them to eat the shit they have sowed for being \nthey way they are, corrupt.\nDon't believe they are ? Have you done any research to refute my claim?\nDo I have evidence of that very thing, I sure do.. Oh, you don't like that? \nWell that is what you are voting for Hill Billrary when you tow that line \nfor them and just vote Dem Can, it is sad you lack the capacity to fight \nthat you give in to them and forgo your ideals of being progressive to be \ncomplacent, and that's the problem.\n\nTo say it's not is denial the same denial that many Progressives have lived \nwith for years till they got sStockholm syndrome, and just tow that fucking \nline.\nThose that did this are fucking weak, they have no fight and will not, they \nhave character as feeble as a Elephant with MS, they are the ones that back \nher and have signs that have \"I'm with her!\" on it... That is a failure and \nthey should be ashamed but they are being pragmatic as it is seen as the \nsafe route that we can't get all that Bernie wants but we could get what \nHill wants.... Not true with her you will get less than she says....\n\nSo you wind up towing the line like a punk ass motherfucker that can only \nbitch and whine about things rather than fight for the things we all want.\nYou call them \"Stupid\" but you just lack any will to fight, any passion to \npush for what you want, you are the weak, the feeble that will tow that \nline willingly that will lay down your progressive ideals and carry her to \na win.\n\nYou may say \"Hey! I voted for Bernie during the Primary in my State!\" \nCongrats cupcake you just made me think less of you.\nThat you have the audacity to call people stupid but you like the \nconviction and spine to see the fight through.\nYou just give up and throw in the towel because it's hard,it's too \ndifficult and I can't stand the pain.\nYou can't endure you are weak, mentally they have defeated you because you \nhave walked away.\n\nSo in your mind anyone that is still fighting is then \"Stupid\" by default \nto make yourself feel better cup cake,.\n\nAs far as ruining the Country... It's been that way a long fucking time \nButtercup, so IF those Bernie supporters switch to Trump and truly fuck the \ncountry more then it was the DNC's fault for disenfranchising so many \npeople, for not being with the populace, for not being for the people.\n\nMore so when Bernie is not taking any money from Banks/corporation/fossil \nfuels.\nBernie released his Tax Returns and Hill Billy can't release her Goldman \nSachs speeches, kinda of fucked up that Hill Billraries could be like that \nand not see that She was a Goldwater Girl and that fucker was truly racist.\n\nThen she claimed that meeting MLK Opened her eyes to the problems in the \nBlack Community...\nAfter many years in 1994 she calls all black children \"Super Predators\" and \nthen that years 2 million go to prison..\nNot only that she caters to the For-profit-prison crowd.... SEEMS totally \nlegit!!!! \nIt's like she was a rapist and her defense was \"But I fucked them up the \nass, so it wasn't legitimate.\"\n\nShe's been ass fucking people a long ass time.... Her time as senator what \ndid she do that was meaningful ?\nSponsored 3 bills she didn't write... TOWED the line for the banks and gave \nthem Tax Payer money...\nThen she supported TRADE deals all she could...Those that hurt the American \neconomy...\nShe truly isn't a Natural politician, she just like handed \"Special Ed\" \npower...And you would vote for that, shame on you.\nBecause you lack the capacity or the conviction to fight, becaue you are \nweak and feeble doesn't give you the right to tell people they are \"Stupid\" \nfor your self rationalization to make yo feel better about it.\n\nDoing the right thing is difficult... You are just to weak to do so, this \nis why you punk out halfway through anbd leave, and give up, then tow that \nline, eventually you will complain about it and what she is doing, but \nsince you towed that line you will defend her and why because you will \nconvince yourself this was the best thing I could do given I had to (Only \nby your standard is this something you had to do, you lack fight to make \nchange and you look down o others that will make change and are doing that, \nyou call them names, you blame them...)\n\nbut all that you do project how you truly see yourself, how you are weak \nand misguided, because you believe there can never be change so you shout \ndown at others that fight for it. \nYou are atrocious, you are just the problem, because you are pitiful,the \nweak, the feeble, the one that will not fight but scream for change.\nThose that support Bernie all the way and beyond aren't the problem.\n\nIt's people like you, that \"Settle\" that convince themselves that they are \ndoing this for the better of the choices and that change will eventually \ncome.\nIT will not come without action, it won't come from wishes and hopes, YOU \nmust fight, YOU must challenge, you must make them fold to you not you to \nthem.\nTHEY should cater to YOU, you should force them to by any means, YOU lack \neverything needed to fight for change.\n\nNow evaluate yourself, as the problem lies at your feet.\nYou have no passion, no fight, no conviction, no will to fight, no will to \nendure, you are the feeble weak punk ass motherfucker that just tows the \nparty line hoping they will eventually grant you change without you \nfighting.\nBecause you can not be bothered to do anything hard, so how dare you talk \ndown to another motherfucker that is fighting, how dare you rationalize the \nthings you do to see yourself as doing what is right....\n\nBecause you will never be right when you constantly tow their line and \nsettle, and continue to be weak, pragmatic, feeble, utterly useless in a \nfight for change."}}]}, "z122gfyilsvkhdh3522exxewtnv1i3ryd04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZRGU2H3ngrgGpn6yrINKbg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Don A", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-03T03:16:54.790Z", "videoId": "DUfMycQS16k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZRGU2H3ngrgGpn6yrINKbg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2016-05-03T03:16:54.790Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116216246774505374787", "textDisplay": "yes.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12cu5nhskarhdvkm23kynm50rv5ixrp404": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbpg2369709WPYNH5-XeEMg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Joel Gallardo", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-03T22:27:47.174Z", "videoId": "DUfMycQS16k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCbpg2369709WPYNH5-XeEMg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2016-05-03T22:27:47.174Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102029014789240936995", "textDisplay": "YES\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ishoa0pnaxlj4w04ci5dyupijupeweew": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz7MkEpuQdmUm_2Sc6akIKg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Box0Rain", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-03T17:29:59.644Z", "videoId": "DUfMycQS16k", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCz7MkEpuQdmUm_2Sc6akIKg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.18940399999999996, "formal_score": 25, "updatedAt": "2016-05-03T17:29:59.644Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105274313441841430948", "textDisplay": "Hillary Clinton = TPP, TTIP, TiSA.

Fourth, she would \nNOT give us \"incremental change\" (social category), she WOULD give us the \nexact same abrogation of social rights that Chump is stumping for...BECAUSE \nSHE IS ANOTHER FUCKING LYING REPUBLICAN PIECE OF SHIT! Fifth, she would NOT \ngive us \"trickle down\" (economic category), because THAT was a \nthinly-veiled tax grab (that never ended, and has only gotten worse)...she \nWOULD give us outright theft and larceny on a scale Chump can only have wet \ndreams of. Finally, fuck them BOTH #BernieOrBust #NeverClinton"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCctks21nDrZcHR6fmqls8Rg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "David Eilering", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13hdzqr2nqgyhkvq23ze3ypekfts1eqw04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-09T14:34:45.773Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCctks21nDrZcHR6fmqls8Rg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29592599999999997, "formal_score": 18, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-09T14:34:45.773Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115214546937393882653", "textDisplay": "+Strutinan If Hillary is elected she will be the corporatist that she and \nBill have always been.
