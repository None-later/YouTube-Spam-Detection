This may make us appear more aggressive,not to \nmention (for the most part) Americans are extremely independent,and really \ndon't want help from the government (unless they ask for it or it's a \nconstitutional requirement need)(like for example Americans overwhelmingly \nreject socialism) anyway at the end of the day Americans are workaholics \n(this is maybe not always good) but none the less Americans take off the \nfewest days for vacations and for the most part that's done voluntarily.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ugfqh1mi5tblxs04cjlqwbqygxblrvoc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyOizv7E54ObPt7Wj65MIww", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nxFtNGojw8c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI8/uQywU-moeFk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Daniel Butler", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-20T21:35:04.815Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCyOizv7E54ObPt7Wj65MIww"}, "sentiment_score": 0.98016970999999997, "formal_score": 91, "updatedAt": "2015-04-20T21:35:04.815Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102651001505699930965", "textDisplay": "Lissette makes my heart go thump.

No. \nAmerica is not the best country in the world, and honestly not many people \nthat I know think America is the best country in the world. There are the \nolder patriots that believe hands down that America is the best. I \nunderstand that. We're used to what we have. You're used to what you have. \nI understand that there are people that will disagree and thats fine, \nwhatever I honestly dont care. We aren't the worst country, not by a \nlongshot but it's the other way too. We aren't the best and we aren't the \nworst. These very long arguments i'm seeing down below are so unbelievably \npointless. What are you trying to prove? That your country is better than \nAmerica or simply that America's awful? Why? Why are you doing that. \nAmerican's make fun of America all the time, we joke and we laugh. But we \ncare about our country just as much as everyone else. I'm sorry that you \ncome across a few hundred American's that are concieted and think that \ntheir country is on top of the world but dont forget that there are \nthousands of others that are sitting there completely content with how \nAmerica is, not boasting that it's the best, not saying that it's the \nworst. America has changed a lot in it's ordeals lately. But the older \npeople that were alive when things were polar opposite dont want to change, \nor atleast that's my experience with them. Yes, there are asshole \namericans. But there are assholes in every single country. I'm sorry if \namerican's jerks are a little bit louder then we want them to be. \n\n\nI'm sorry.

That answer was kind of lacking IMO.  It's not \nabout power.  I would say that is the least of the reasons.\n\nOne, America could not have happened without firearms.  Fighting the \nnatives (horrible as it was), fighting the British (they had it coming \nthough ;) ), hunting- early Americans *needed* guns.  If you didn't have a \ngun you were dependent on someone else for your food and your protection. \n Americans like freedom. We do not like to be beholden to anyone else for \nany reason, so that independence guns provided our ancestors has persisted \nin a feeling of independence today- even though we rarely hunt or need to \ndefend ourselves. \n\nTwo, the guys who founded America, the Founding Fathers I think they are \ncalled, were not big fans of totalitarian regimes.  They really did want \ncitizens to have a last ditch recourse against another King George III \nwanna be if it came to that.  That also persist today - this country was \nfounded by people who did not trust government, so what do you expect?  I \nhave to disagree with the suggestion that private firearm ownership is not \na deterrent to government overreach too- because militias showed up, armed \nto the teeth, and Cliven Bundy still has his cows on Federal land, now \ndoesn't he?  Why didn't the government just take them out? Because that \nwould have just made things worse.  The threat of things getting out of \nhand was great enough that the government backed down (even though Bundy \nwas clearly in the wrong).\n\nI would also like to point out that anyone who feels invincible and \npowerful just from shooting or holding a gun SHOULD NOT DO THAT.  They are \ndangerous- reckless and undisciplined at best, murderous at worst.   With \ngreat power comes great responsibility really applies to private firearm \nownership- and the biggest problem with 'gun culture' is that a lot of the \npeople who own guns do not own the responsibility part of the equation.\n\nI do agree about the sexuality thing, though.  Christians have always been \nterrified of sex, and the fundy Bible-thumping sort that have hijacked most \nChristian churches and the GOP are really terrified of sex!  Remember: the \nfirst successful Imperialist-era settlement in the Americas was composed of \nPuritans...\n\nI agree with the language thing, too.  We don't because we don't really \nhave to.  We're waaaay over here away from almost anyone else, most \nimmigrants learn English within a generation or two, and the people most \nAmericans meet even in Mexico (tourism industry employees) speak English \nanyway.\n\nAbout the cars question.  We didn't invent the automobile (Vielen Danke, \nHerr Benz) but we sure took the idea and ran with it. It may be in shambles \nnow, but once upon a time Detroit really was the car capitol of the world. \n  Plus, America is freaking HUGE.  The distance between Copenhagen and \nVienna would not even get you out of my home state!  Everything is spread \nout here- to the point that mass transit is only viable in larger cities \nand in those few areas that are heavily developed, like New England and \nparts of California and Florida.  So most Americans don't just want cars- \nwe need them just to get around.  For example, even when traffic is light \nyou can't get from the south end of Houston to the north end in under 30 \nminutes- and that is on the freeway going 65 MPH!  Oh, and remember that \nfreedom thing? yeah, that's another reason we like cars: the freedom to go \nanywhere we want anytime we want, no schedules, baggage checks, or tickets \nrequired.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z133fxhxiq3hytn20221s33o3vicsny33": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzwzosHXgJ6mJLrrJ5LdrA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-F7JGK9bJQqA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/R1l_UAKyoBM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MST3Killa", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-26T03:08:55.036Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZzwzosHXgJ6mJLrrJ5LdrA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.30344600000000005, "formal_score": 54, "updatedAt": "2015-09-26T03:08:55.036Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113465391389387707563", "textDisplay": "Sigh... Look, first off, I don't own a gun. I don't particularly want to \nown a gun as I find them very dangerous but I do reserve the right to \nprotect myself and if a threat is viable enough, I would do so. I also \nthink people take \"gun culture\" at times too far just as people really push \nthe boundaries of free speech and other freedoms we have in the US. \nHowever, this country was born out of revolution. These 2 dopes up here \nseem to think it's laughable that a government would ever hurt it's own \npeople and that simply because a country has a large and advanced military \nthat it can't be beaten. Wrong on both fronts. Guns for personal protection \nis a simple concept. Generally speaking, and this is changing as evidenced \nby these two, American's don't like to give away freedoms to the state. \nYes, we have police, yes we have a military, but, we are very wary of \nentrusting all of our personal protection rights to them as we are often \nsuspicious (rightfully so in my opinion) of anyone who holds that kind of \npower over another. Now, the idea of personal protection does not mean just \none individual to another. An armed population serves as a serious \ndeterrent both foreign invaders as well as a warning against a tyrannical \ngovernment. These two laughed off the idea that the US military could be \nbeaten by some dudes in Michigan with a couple rifles.... Which, that \nscenario is true... however, 40% of Americans own at least one firearm and \n20% own more than four. That's 128.8 million Americans. Do these two think \nthe US military (or any invading foreign military? or any military in \nregards to 40% of it's own population) can realistically battle 128.8 \nMillion armed individuals? Nope. The US military (as well as Soviet \nmilitary at the height of it's power) had a hard enough time dealing with \nguerrilla fighters in the middle east and their numbers were no where close \nto this. What's the saying? \" You cannot invade the United States. There \nwould be a rifle behind every blade of grass.\" (this is an unsubstantiated \nquote attributed to Isoroku Yamamoto but the point still stands.) So, no a \ncouple dudes in Michigan are not going to fend off the entire US military \nwith a couple rifles in the woods... over a hundred million dudes in the \nwoods and mountains and in the streets and cities and countryside and ports \nand deserts and suburbs...... yeah...now the Military would be in trouble. \nThat's even assuming the military sides with the tyrannical state at all, \nit is party of their oath to protect from enemies both foreign and \ndomestic... It doesn't say that domestic enemies are only potentially \ndangerous civilians and it doesn't say that for good reason. Sadly, people \ndon't want to believe that a tyrannical state could ever possibly exist in \nthis country or that there is no way any foreign army would ever attempt to \ninvade... while I share that desire and hope, the saying goes; hope for the \nbest, prepare for the worst.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13qwnuqsz3hzfymx224zn45quzcs50ud": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaxt19z4_ZKuqwIdKYjvn2g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ciara Jowett", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-23T16:39:56.304Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaxt19z4_ZKuqwIdKYjvn2g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.54803399999999991, "formal_score": 10, "updatedAt": "2014-12-23T16:39:56.304Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102415011997784076135", "textDisplay": "Maybe not a terrorist attack, as such, but more like a school shooting...\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12nuxa5buuyvfzzz04ccd3qbqndc1yrgmk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0rrfqd3AVjZeswq1aEzaQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Daniel Roberts", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-06T17:39:33.061Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCV0rrfqd3AVjZeswq1aEzaQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.058683999999999958, "formal_score": 17, "updatedAt": "2015-08-06T17:39:33.061Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117193148291718272573", "textDisplay": "These two people are on some sort of narcotic.

People that are bilingual have a better chance of \nscoring a good or well paying job and have more doors opened for a brighter \nfuture.

It's always better to be fluent in more than one \nlanguage. Of course you Caucasian people may not agree but that's just how \nit is in America today.. \"Speak English We are in America we don't need to \nknow another language\" it's very funny that you all say the exact same \nthing. A while back at my local post office there was a man Scott a tall \nCaucasian man who was costumer service unfortunately had to quit his job \ndue to lacking Spanish. Many Spanish speaking people would come to the post \noffice therefore having a language barrier thus holding up the line. They \nhad to put him in the back where the physical labor work was at and \ncouldn't handle it so he had to quit. That's kinda sad if you ask me he was \na really good man.

Whether it be your bills, whether it be your \nkids, they come second, because if we dont stop this, we might not have \nANYTHING left. We as a people, need to once and for all stop the \noppressors, instead of watching a video or reading about them.. such as we \nhave done against England and won in 1776.. we need change, and I mean \nserious change.. go look at our current debt! go look! I dare you! This was \ncaused by our lack of ability to make change and be what we once called, \nbeing an American. Americans are special people, it is time we start acting \nlike it once again and being the logical innovating people we are instead \nof clinging to other people's beliefs and ideas across the world like china \nand some idiot running for president.. or something we heard so we \ntherefore think its true without seeing the evidence to think so.. because \nwe dont have any thoughts for ourselves as individuals. It is time we stop \nthinking as a larger whole and in ignorance and start thinking as \nindividual leaders who have a philosophical and reasoning outlook on there \nworld to trully learn and be confident as individual AMERICANS, not \nAmerica. America was once defined by its people and what they conquered, we \nreached for the moon and passed the stars. Now? we let the very business's \nand there inventions by which we conquered in the pursuit of a greater \ngood, conquer us. We have become numb, we have shut ourselves in from our \ncommunity. In a world of abundance, we are left in want and despair. Where \nwe have the power to reach out to millions of people, but fail to make that \ndifference. It is time that we put morals and community before our own \nproblems and selfish needs, its time we all as Americans do the right thing \nregardless of the outcome or reason to not want to do so. It is time we put \ncourage and Community over self gain and fear. The very fabric of our \nsociety depends on each American standing up for things like Morals, Common \nsense, and making a difference through there own leadership and not living \na lavish life with a utility build they cant afford, thats in a house with \na mortgage that they cant pay, to protect children they cant afford to take \ncare of.. It is time we show our appreciation for the very fabric of what \nmakes us Human, our community and ability to express our ideas, not conquer \nour self gain and self devouring. our current age of technology, we have \nbecome numb, like so have the Romans who fell from being distracted with \nthe Colosseum set up by the very abusers who starved them to ruins. So many \nparallels to our current time, so we need to realize the timer is ticking, \nare we going to wait for the next American to do it? Or are we going to \nface the actual issue by facing what we believe in with courage.. and be \nhuman again by being selfless by representing Freedom and Equality by which \nwe root for each year on July 4th.. It is as if we have kept the pride, but \nhave forgotten the purpose of why America started.. It is time we become \nwhat we once were, courageous, inspired, inclined, political, informed, \nmoraled, logical, Americans. The society of people by which represented \nMorals and Innovation with a face of courage, not a lifestyle of closure \nand contempt, in fear of being wrong and ignorant. We were not belittled by \nintelligence, we conquered it knowing we know little, and realized that \nthis fact made it interesting to learn so much of what our world has to \noffer. The issue is us, we let this happen. Morals among our people become \nemotionally driven responses, and Innovation has become corporately tied \nbecause we are led by the weakest of us, which is not for the greater good. \nIt is time we realize this and not against our ego, but towards our \nintelligence and self reasoning and pursuit to have a purpose.. by which we \nput hardwork and the pursuit of knowledge over temporary pleasure that \nmasks fear and insecurities. I am still waiting for the day that we as \nAmericans once again lead the rest of the world in the pusuit of wisdom, \nmorals, and intelligence in being exactly what we are, humans, \nintelligently thinking creatures based on reason and logic, by which we use \nto care for each other unconditionally not based on what we think is right, \nbut what is right. Once this becomes fullfilled and we understand the very \nfabric of not only the purpose of why America started, I think we will once \nagain understand our true purpose not in ego, but in leadership.. in the \npursuit to once again lead the Human race into a better life.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13witviuy2muhuyk04ce5ixkqfkvtawbmg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBfDAhwZKU4gwq--YthHXAQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 5.882352941176471, "authorDisplayName": "AmpharosNinja", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-04T13:43:05.171Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBfDAhwZKU4gwq--YthHXAQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.75036999999999998, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-07-04T13:43:05.171Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104266632306665445594", "textDisplay": "America FUCK YAY!!!!!!!

There are so many beautiful, intriguing places with \nfascinating religions, delicious food and ways of life, that are so vastly \ndifferent from one another, why would you choose? \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12rczmhrorstthxo04civkzhzf4fff45kw0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcJhz_2fP5WisGvqnE4wtg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BSF9VT6fK3w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE8/wgswBO-1m5k/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "John C", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-24T02:04:59.534Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGcJhz_2fP5WisGvqnE4wtg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.927454, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-07-24T02:04:59.534Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105025576508920976340", "textDisplay": "cause why not?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13mwvqaeljjzj3n523msjgyszjfc1cwu04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Q_Eve3lT4PdAQntDubf0w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cGNOLBuaH58/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/e1nvpr1qjVs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "CdePausNL", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-11T06:04:05.934Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1Q_Eve3lT4PdAQntDubf0w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.025670000000000026, "formal_score": 66, "updatedAt": "2015-06-11T06:04:05.934Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117019880798715537695", "textDisplay": "I live in the Netherlands and we don't get taught we're the best country in \nthe world.

posting but I just had to comment.  The answers to \nthe first question \"Why are Americans so obsessed with guns?\" was very \nuninformative and generic.   John's comment that  you have to believe in \ntwo different things to be an American was offensive and basically gave a \nstereotype of hillbilly rednecks shooting in the woods.  This is so not \ntrue.  He seems to have forgotten his elementary school teachings where our \nbasic rights as Americans and why we have those rights in the first place \nare explained.  It WAS a group of farmers and hunters and small landowners \nwho took down the British government despite the fact they were under \nconstant threat of having their families murdered and homes burned. \n\nThe ability to carry and own arms was written into the constitution as a \nreminder to our government that we did it once and we can do it again if \nthey seek to oppress us as a nation.  I feel that as an educational program \nposting onto an international format like youtube more thought and \nconsideration should have been placed into your answers.

Americans are not \"obsessed\" with guns because it is usually war torn \ncountries and the psychopaths in charge that carry obsessions with guns. \nTarget shooting and hunting are the oldest sports in this country so trying \nto ban them is like trying to ban baseball equipment. Many Americans live \nin rural areas where they have to be self sufficient, so guns are a \nnecessity.\n\n2. Bullshit, complete bullshit. Here are a few examples of very popular yet \nvery sexually explicit media; 50 Shades Of Grey, Lady GaGa, Desperate \nHousewives,the porn industry, and Miley Cyrus's fucking twerk. Go to any \ndance club in the USA and people are usually doing a very intricate form of \ndry humping on the dance floor.\n\n3. English is a colonial language and has the most countries using it as an \nofficial language on the planet with more speaking it as a foreign language \nthan those with a native tongue. Go almost anywhere in the world and you're \nalmost guaranteed to find someone with at least a basic understanding of \nEnglish. Unless living abroad, learning another language is almost a \nnovelty for Americans. Take for example, my mother is fluent in French but \nhardly travels to France or has French speaking friends. Why learn another \nlanguage if it will rarely be used?\n\n4.The Interstate System is why we rely heavily on cars.

That makes absolutely no sense. Or did you just then \nrealize it? In which case it obviously isn't that big of an issue if it \ntook you over 2 years of living there to have a problem.\n\nAlright, you'll likely be treated differently if you're female, or if you \nlike different things, or if you dress different, or if you are of a \ndifferent ethnicity. Foreign countries aren't the only places that do this. \nIt happens everywhere. It's human nature to follow society.

Because of this, stereotypes and (as I said in my very first message) \novergeneralizations are passed around until at least half of the population \nbelieves them. It happens everywhere, people are just trying to fit in.\n\nThat's screwed up, and I'm pretty sure there are laws against that. If they \nturned you down just for being American, you most likely wouldn't have \nliked the job anyways. How did they even know you were American?\n\nSo your husband/wife wouldn't consider moving to the US? Yeah, the \nrepublican vs democrat thing is ridiculous, and I can't stand the news. \nBoth sides are so... well, one sided. Though, have you ever thought that \nmaybe the reason people both here and in other countries hate it so much \nisn't completely because they are just wrong, but because America really is \nscrewed up? We have a very high crime rate, an education that is really \nonly affordable to high-class people, we eat WAY more than we need to, we \nhave teen pregnancies all over the place, we have this weird fetish for \nblame and justice about the most miniscule things, and people will sue each \nother about anything. I mean, the top 1% of Americans have over 40% of all \nof the US currency, while the other 99% are left with the rest to share \namongst themselves. And they blame us for being greedy. As someone who grew \nup in a home with a single working mother, in a cheep rented house, behind \non rent, eating ramen most days, getting the electric turned off, and my \nmum still worked to get a better degree, and still worked a job, and still \nraised my family, I have a hard time respecting people who waste a millions \nor a billion of dollars on a car or a boat when my family is struggling to \nmake a thousand for food and housing. Now I'm not that poor, but we are far \nfrom rich. Life is unfair, humans are cruel, that's how it works. A prime \nexample is school. Ever notice some kids in school are popular, while some \nget their faces beat in? Why is that? It's because humans build themselves \nup by beating others down. That is why I don't like nationalism, it gives \npeople another thing of theirs to build up by beating other people down, \nthen they retaliate, and the cycle continues with few the wiser. Sadly, the \nwiser people are beaten down as well, because people don't like change or \ndifference, they like conformity.

At the time the United States \nwas founded, about 90% of the population was rural settlers.  These people \nrelied on firearms for subsistence hunting- not everyone raised livestock \nenough to butcher, and even if a market was less that a few days travel \naway, most settlers were too poor to buy a side of beef or something.  So \nthey hunted.  Firearms were a common tool then.  Why would the Founding \nFathers put such a constraint on what was an everyday necessity for \nsurvival? They wouldn't- it was a commonsense assumption that people should \nhave the ability to own a basic means of survival.  The militia clause of \nthe Second was just that- a legal means to organize militias before the \nU.S. had a standing army.\n\n2) regardless of what the Founding Fathers intended, since Heller vs DC and \nMcDonald vs Chicago, what they intended doesn't matter.  It's pretty \nobvious that you're not American, so I don't expect you to know how our \ngovernment works.  But I am going to explain it.\n\nAs you may know, pretty much everything in U.S. law depends on the \nConstitution.  Our SCOTUS (Supreme Court of the United States) is the last \nword on determining if a law is Constitutional or not- they ultimately \ndecide this by simple majority decision, and their word is final unless the \nConstitution itself is amended (this has happened only 17 times in the last \n224 years).  In 2008, SCOTUS decided by a narrow 5-4 margin that the Second \nAmendment applies to individual firearm ownership (DC vs Heller).  In 2010, \nin McDonald vs Chicago, SCOTUS decided that the Second applies at a Federal \nlevel (that is, all states must abide by it).  In short, all this means \nthat no matter what one's opinion is, Americans have the Constitutional \nright to individually own firearms. Period, end of story, if you don't like \nit GTFO.\n\nWhat SCOTUS did not say was that this precluded any forms of gun \nregulation.  There is still room for the Federal or even state governments \nto regulate what kinds fo firearms can be owned, but the ownership itself \nwill never go away short of repealing the Second (good luck with that)."}}]}, "z13ci5c4equ3xlrwq04cfzvxol3xcj5w2e0": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Kmi381dflqYdqEhalAiPA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-F736Nvzwr5A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALs/PrpAicLs6DY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.66225165562913912, "authorDisplayName": "Thomas Jefferson", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-15T06:35:37.832Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6Kmi381dflqYdqEhalAiPA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.44663199999999997, "formal_score": 7, "updatedAt": "2014-10-15T06:36:54.000Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102837144971378172535", "textDisplay": "It's not a feeling Liberal !!!

People are going to believe what they want to \nbelieve, I suppose.  It's easier for you to fool yourself into believing \nthat our care costs are higher because we're getting better care, than to \naccept the truth - that corporate greed has taken over the medical \nindustry, and values money over human health, life, and wellbeing - \nsacrificing human beings for profit.\n\nA few years ago, I damaged the tendon in my finger playing basketball.  I \nhad recently lost my insurance, and couldn't afford surgery.\n\nIn order to mitigate the damage, there was a special brace I could buy that \nwould hold my finger in the proper position to help the tendon heal.  It \ncost $800.  That wasn't including any charge for the doctor, that was just \nthe price for the brace.  My doctor suggested the brace because I couldn't \nafford surgery.\n\nI went online and found the brace and ordered it from the United Kingdoms \nfor \u00a315, including shipping, which is the equivalent of about $30.  $20 of \nthat was shipping costs for shipping the thing clear from England.\n\nMy doctor confirmed that it was the exact same brace, and expressed his \ndismay at the state of the U.S. medical industry that had tried to scam me \nfor $800 on a simple piece of metal and styrofoam that obviously shouldn't \nhave cost anywhere near that much.\n\nA few years before that, my daughter spent a night in the hospital, and \nwhen I looked at the bill, I noticed that they charged us $100 for each box \nof tissue that was opened while we were there.  It didn't affect me, \nbecause my insurance company picked up the check.  This was when I realized \nthere was a problem with the insurance industry.  It wasn't until years \nlater during a college research assignment that I fully realized why things \nworked this way.\n\nSimple metal braces that could be ordered from Europe, and tissue paper are \nnot new emerging medical technologies only available in the US.

Every \nproblem nations are having with America, including American aggression is \nthe result of Democracy. Incidentally, I am a liberal and a Declarationism \nactivist. Contrary to anti-gun propaganda very few people that own guns own \nthem as a result of ego. Our laws are very clear that the it is not only \nthw right of the people but the duty to own weapons and be proficient with \nthem.\n\nMost shootings are restricted to bad neighbourhoods and degenerates killing \neach other. Only pea brains are gun nuts. But that does not reflect the \nover all attitude of responsible gun owners. People with little experience \nwith guns feel powerful with them in their hands because they lack respect \nfor the sacred position guns hold in our culture.\n\nLike me and the rest of my family our children were raised not only with \nguns but an array of many other archaic weapons. I was in charge of \nteaching our children the basics of combat. At an early age we taught them \nsafety and disciple with such things as weapons which included respect for \nothers. As the generations before me they too were taught that picking on \npeople and starting fights is one of the most disgraceful things to our \nfamily. The games I played with them were designed to hone their skills as \nwarriors, that they should be able to defend our nation, community, family \nand themselves should the need ever arise. This involved them hitting me \nwith wooden swords and staves. Two of the purposes it served was to teach \nthem self control as they had to pull their strikes so as not to hurt me, \nthis skill is also vital to mastering the use of weapons.\n\nOne day I went to my brother's home for my usual instruction. My sister in \nlaw was babysitting two children from a family of pacifists. They watched \nme teach my nephews and nieces. Horrified at first as they were forbidden \nto express any form of aggression. When it came time for warrior games they \ndecided that it actually looked fun and begged to join. Reluctantly, I let \nthem. This was a good lesson in the evil side of pacifism. Those two \nchildren had no self control and like the reporters on this clip talking \nabout feeling powerful shooting guns, these children acted likewise, it was \nan egocentric kick and they had absolutely no idea of the difference \nbetween anger and aggression. Their eyes filled with hate, hate in a \nchild's eyes for nothing. I had no choice but to end the warrior games for \nthe day and as my nephews and nieces spared I sat down with those two \nchildren and talked to them about those emotions, as their parents should \nhave done. When there parents arrived I had their children stay with my \nnephews and nieces while I confronted the parents away from their ears. \nThey were horrified and insisted their children didn't have an aggressive \nbone in their bodies because they taught them away from it. So I showed \nthem. I first had my nephews and nieces attack me in mass. Then I had their \nchildren do the same and purposefully failed to defend myself. It cost me \nseveral stitches, but I wanted them to see the blood and the monstrosity \nthey had inadvertently created. It was difficult to contain my laughter at \nthe shock, horror and sudden realization on their faces. The next time I \nsaw those children, they were enrolled in Judo classes."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl46H0iyOUObTUd9BGYZVng", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Sapphire Otaku", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ejl4xtvbhixsbf04cfrszzq2ez3rpfoc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-29T02:12:14.300Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCl46H0iyOUObTUd9BGYZVng"}, "sentiment_score": -0.65866800000000003, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-29T02:12:14.300Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4SwI_OQBhRQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGY/jDSCiW3C8ZY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104959516854984286876", "textDisplay": "I've shot guns, but I live in AK, it's really normal here for hunting and \ndefense.

Outsourcing to China has been the mantra for US companies \nfor the past ten years or so and US manufacturing has taken a big hit. It \ndrove many fabs out of business or forced them to dramatically downscale. \nNow that China's wages are going up (and us wages have been flat for \nyears), some of the manufacturing is coming back. Not all, but it is in \nareas where the risks (inferior products, IP theft, bribery to name a few) \nare becoming greater than the rewards (higher profit margin). China's \nquality is not superior. It will probably improve when their overhead costs \nare on the same level as the US and are forced to compete that way.  You \nwill know when that happens when you look out your window and see pigs \nflying around.\n\n\nAs far as the metric system's non-existence in the US, it is a complete \nmyth. Most if not all scientific sectors use the metric system exclusively. \nAs far as machine shops, etc., systems of measurement are irrelevant for \nthe most part. Parts are manufactured to conform to SI standards every day. \nUS standards for industrial stock is probably the biggest hurdle, but its \nrelevance is nearly inconsequential.

We have a right to bear arms. I know many people who own \nguns, but I do not know not one person who always has that gun with them. \nYou either keep the gun at home, or you take it with your while hunting. We \nalso have guns because we're scared. If someone breaks in, you'll be dead \nbefore you call 911. If you're in your own house and someone breaks in, you \nhave the right to shoot them as self defense. It's not about power or \nseeming cool. \n\n     Secondly, about the whole sex thing. They were right for the most \npart. In school, there's always school assemblies or you might take a \nhealth class and learn about STI's. We have so many talks in school about \nthe negatives of sex, that the kids actually start to get scared that \nsomething is going to happen to them. On top of that, America was formed by \nmany puritans and still today most of the population is christian, so we \nlearn in our teen years that the bible says we shouldn't have sex until \nmarried. \n     \n     Third, many americans actually do know a second language and sometimes \neven a third. Either their parents teach it to them from a young age \nbecause of their roots, and/or you might take 2 years of a certain language \nin high school as in most schools, it's a requirement to graduate. Also, we \ndon't really feel the need to because many don't even travel out of the \ncountry. Want to go somewhere hot? Hit up Florida or the southern states. \nThere's plenty of vacation areas like ski resorts all over the country. We \ncan experience everything in comfort of our own country. I live in Ohio. I \ncan easily take an 8 hour drive to New York City if I'm really in the mood. \nI can take a road trip down to North Carolina and go to the beaches down \nthere. I don't need to go to a completely different country and spend all \nthat money to get there. Just a simple map and gas will get me where I \nneed. \n\n     Fourth, as for the cars. It's more of a social class thing. If you \nhave a nice car, it's a way of showing off. Plus, what they said is true. \nThe US is a huge place. Like I said in the last paragraph, we could take a \nsimple road trip to wherever we want. Saying that, we need a way to get \nthere. The only place you will find taxis and buses is in the city. The \nsuburbs and rural areas need cars to get everywhere. Just to get from my \ncity to the next will take you at least 20-30 minutes. We also like the \nfreedom cars give us. We can go wherever, whenever. No need to wait on \nanyone else. You don't need to wait at a place and leave at a certain time. \nIn your own car, you get to choose that.\n\n     Lastly, most americans don't think America is the best. We are proud \nof our country, but only the naive people are blind to the political \nproblems going on. I know where I'm from, we like to take pride in things \nand show that. We love to host barbecues for the Fourth of July and go full \nout in red, white, and blue. We go all out in sports colors for the Super \nBowl. To us, it's fun. We enjoy taking pride in who we are. It's just \nsomething we do. I guess you could say showing your pride is like an \nunwritten rule in America. It's seen as a good thing. We like to get \ntogether with our neighbors and celebrate our country. Almost everyone \nknows that we have many flaws, but so do other countries. Other countries \nprobably believe their country is the best too. We take pride in our \ncountry, but we don't think it's the best. Many realize that we have a lot \nof things we can work on, but we also like to take a step back and just \nsmile at how far we've gotten. Although we have many problems, we also like \nto look at the bright side of things. Another thing? We also exaggerate a \nlot, but who doesn't? A lot of times when we say something is the best, we \ndon't really mean it. I get that we might be a little too proud sometimes, \nbut don't think all of us are ignorant and naive to the problems going on. \nWe see them, we really do. We also see the good things though, and that's \nsomething many people around the world fail to realize: there are good \nthings about the United States of America too.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUmFSLtmYfCPr7sM_1d99EQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.78740157480314965, "authorDisplayName": "ferrariteddy", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125vrcorrjdzfzkh224yfzovmfbyppup", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-23T13:24:12.455Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUmFSLtmYfCPr7sM_1d99EQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.75188199999999994, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-23T13:24:12.455Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108105646094764831249", "textDisplay": "Honestly i dont care if they take away our guns, ill just buy them \nilligaly, (allegedly) but we do need guns to fight the government.

Militias and Ordinary Civilians fought and won. On top of that, the \nConstitution can be changed at any time just by voting for that change. Not \nthat it is that easy. The United States Constitution is also one of the \neasiest things to replicate and other countries constitutions and similar \nto the Bill of Rights are based on the United States. The rights of the \npeople, right??\nFor Cars, it depends on which state and city you live in. But they were \ntotally correct on that we totally obsessed with them. I really have no \nidea why but if you don't have a car you aren't getting any pussy. But just \nhaving one even a shitty one in high school or college you get some no \nmatter what.\nFor the language and the why we think we are the best country. I remember \nin high school history class reading about the term \"schooling\" being \nbrought up. It was to refer to how we were taught so we could be a unified \nnation. It was a long time ago so my memory is a little fuzzy but I believe \nit brought up speaking English, being taught the same things in the \ncurriculum. One of the most important things it brought up was that parents \nbelieved the schools should be responsible for teaching their children \ncertain things while the schools or government believed the parents should \nbe teaching their children those things. The range of what should be taught \nvaried from finances to sex and so much more. So that's why we have to have \na parent sign those little papers asking if your child can attend this and \nthat. So the schooling we received was pretty much to make sure children \nknow how wipe their own asses and everyone is on the same page. It does \ntake a way from the culture they may have come from but you can always take \nyour child and educate them yourself. We are also educated in schools about \nall the wars the US has been FORCED to take over. I don't even want to \nargue with some foreigners on the comments I am sure to get but yes we were \nforced more times than none into wars that we never had to go into. After \nthat we pretty much became the police of the world and I think Americans \nare pretty damn tired of it. We don't just fight for our freedom but for \nother peoples freedom and you can spin any way you want but that is what we \nare led to believe because most people in the US do not involve themselves \nwith politics. They get manipulated by their family, church and the news \nthat these people are being oppressed and we must do something to help them.\nFor Sex, yes we are very oppressed when it comes to this topic. Almost \nevery country I have been to seems to be more open to this and so you get \nlittle children running around all the time with no fathers.

Still, Germany, as a whole, DID vote \nfor the Chancellor-in-the-running in 1933. The burden is shared.\n\nIn re your second point: The US\u2019s involvement in the Reconstruction of \nEurope and its subsequent occupation thereof played a CRITICAL role in \nsecuring the European/World peace. Lend Lease, the Marshall Plan, and debt \nforgiveness were all INSTRUMENTAL in preventing another Trans-European \nconflict.  The US\u2019s disproportionately high presence and levels of \ninfluence in NATO and its vital role as \u201cJupiter\u201d during the Cold War gave \nWestern European countries (ESPECIALLY Germany) and MANY others the slack, \ntime, and resources it needed to achieve their qualit(ies) of life. Though \nyou accurately implied that the US acts according to its own self-interest \nfirst and foremost, the FACT is: without the USA, there would have been NO \nEuropean agreement at all.  \n\nAs for your third point: The elimination of the despotism symbolized and \nembodied by Charles I was INDEED the milestone for Britain\u2019s Industrial and \nTechnological ascendance. Cromwell was barely a bump in the road. The lack \nof an \u201corderly society\u201d (a la a monarch/warlord/authoritarian overlord) was \nkey to Britain\u2019s creative and industrial development. The Lunar Society \nemerged less than a century after Cromwell\u2019s antics and formed the pinnacle \nof free-thinking British society. While assorted German inventors and a FEW \n\u201cGerman scientists\u201d did manage to make some notable contributions to the \nBritish/American Industrial/Technological Revolution(s), the basis of \nAnglo-American success lie in the lack of constraints present in German \nsociety.

I widely agree with you. However, I wouldn\u2019t say that \nBavarians bear the \u201cguilt\u201d of Hitler cause Hitler was the necessary an \npredictable consequence of the dictate of Versailles, which not only \ncastrates Germany politically but also led to big mass unemployment and \nmass mortality due to following famine strikes in the early days of the \nWeimar Republic.\n \n2. The declining number of wars and genocides is due to factors like higher \neducation and vital depravation in most countries (not only in the western \nworld). It has nothing to do with the dominance of any superpower in the \nworld. Especially the European consensus was the consequence of cultural \nEuropean development and the high-developed \u201chistorical sense\u201d In \nNietzsches terminology, which was very pronounced in the high educated \noccidental countries, especially in Germany. If there were never be the \nUSA, the European agreement would have came true even faster and more \nthorough cause the US prefer an \u201cunited Europe\u201d just under their \ndomination, but by far never a strong and independent *Europa unita* with \nit\u2019s own global policies. \u2013\n \n3. I never doubt that Britain has taked the lead in modern technological \ndevelopment since the 18th century. However, I really doubt that this \ndevelopment was due to the dispatching of Charles I. The cynical mass \nmurderer Cromwell wasn\u2019t the biggest enforcer of culture and science at \nall. It was more or less the necessary consequence of normal civilisatory \ndevelopment, in which Britain was ahead of Europe even before Cromwell.\nHowever, if we look at the technologies we still use today, especially \nGerman inventors contribute a lot. Look at cars, TV, computers, jet engines \nand so on. At the turn of the century Germany has overtaken Britain in \ntechnological development an was the new leader.

Since 1871 Britain was the worst enemy of Germany\u2019s development. \nThe British government never were interested in an industrial development \nof Germany, they want to destroy they biggest rival, which was going to \novertake Britain economically.\nAnd when you say that German intellectuals and inventors stand out in spite \nof the necessary militarism you\u2019re praising German genius even more!

Sorry but no cigar on short sided \nthinking of rely on military alone.\n\nPoint 4: I was not aware of that, but your arguments are still bad.  Fact \nof the matter is big cars are dumb and I agree that we have lousy \ntransportation.  However part of the argument still remains in it being an \nAmerican hobby because cars are essentially American.  We have a cultural \naffinity that grew up around it.\n\nPoint 5: First it's Iraq not \"Irak\".  I agree with you that those wars were \ntotally wrong and still are wrong under Obama or Bush.  Which is why point \n1 is VERY valid.  We have rogue elements in our country and it's becoming \nclearer and clearer they are using us for their own prosperity and gain. \n Without arming ourselves there would be no reason for them not to turn on \nselect groups in America.  They are doing this slowly with minorities in \nthis country.  However when the time is golden for them they will turn on \npolitical dissidents in general.  It does not take long for a country to \nfall into the hands of a wicked dictator with piss poor ideologist leading \nthe masses.  We are already seeing this happening with the terrible \nmovements in the middle east and Africa for material supremacy or worse. \n While I don't claim to know their motives you are an idiot to think wolves \nare not lying in wait to use a super power like us for their own agenda and \nwould not jump at the moment we are disarmed.  We do not own guns to fight \nour government we own it to insure it stays noble and good for the world. \n We do not want to be slaughtering innocent people because of lies.  We \nrather be building up those nations and really helping them.  The majority \nof people here are spoon fed information from a bias media which screams a \nsocialist or fascist agenda.  We wish to stay a conservative country, not \nrepublican.  However our values are based on looking out for the little guy \nand protecting those who can't protect themselves.  I think when us \nAmericans put aside our differences and get along and step away from all \nthe political bullshit we all want to be a light in the world.  We just \ndon't know how to get there and we are being steered by evil people who \nonly think about number 1.  Trust me.

You are proud of your Army, yet you despise it at the \nsame time. You know it can take on any other army in the world, yet if you \nwere invaded you have only yourselves to defend against it? It is true that \nduring your battle for independence there was (at first) no real army. You \nhad to fight almost individually. And yes, it's a big country, open and \nrather unpopulated with lots of danger animals, lots of Indians, lots of \nherbivores you can shoot to get fresh meat... but at a certain point, no \nlater than at the end of the nineteenth century when the \"frontier\" was \nover, all these things could and should be done by the army, by the police, \nspecial security forces, wild animal & forest management etc. How is it \npossible that so many Americans think that their own government is actively \nworking against them? How is it possible that so many Americans think that \nthey have to arm themselves AGAINST their own government?\n\n\nPoint 4: The automobile / car is absolutely not an American invention. It \nis an European invention. You might want to look up the name of Karl \nBenz... and others like him because if it weren't for him than some \nFrenchman or German or Englishman or American would have come up with a \nworking horseless carriage using an explosion engine. Or maybe it is better \nto claim that it is an Western invention. You can also claim that the \n(heavier than air) airplane is an American invention but that's not true, \nif it hadn't been for the Wright brothers, surely within just a couple of \nyears, some other European or American would have come up with a working \nflying machine. It was just a coincidence. The reason why Americans love \ntheir (huge) cars is more practical, because of the greater distances and \nthe lousy public (ground) transport.\n\n\nPoint 5. The US only try to install / protect etc. democratic governments \nif it suits them. Western Europe only got Marshall help because the US were \nafraid of losing it to the Soviets and losing it as a market for selling \ntheir products. Invading Afghanistan? Okay... pity it didn't help. Invading \nIrak? Pretty bad idea.

Incidentally, in reading your \nearlier comments, I'd like to point out that you didn't quite get the \nwording of the amendment right. The sentence is, in fact, grammatically \nincorrect due to its first comma. That one article of punctuation has been \nresponsible for more bitter disputes than any other I can think of: \n\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, \nthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\" \n\n\nIt appears clear that this amendment states that in order to defend a state \nfrom its enemies, *both foreign and domestic,* a militia is needed. And \nobviously this militia would be pretty ineffective without arms. \nConsidering the historical context, I think it's safe to say that the \nframers were worried both about invasion from outside forces (England to \nthe North and overseas, France to the West, Spain to the South) and about \nthe degradation of the government into tyranny. A representative democracy \nwas, after all, a giant experiment; nobody was sure it would work. \n\n\nAll of that aside, I think it's important to *remain* with historical \ncontext long enough to acknowledge the fact that the firearms of the time \nwere laughably slow, inaccurate, and generally unwieldy in comparison with \nthe sleek killing machines of today. In those times, it would have been \nalmost impossible for a child to shoot himself, even with a weapon that had \njust been loaded with powder and projectile. The possibility of someone \nfiring more than a shot a second without reloading would have left the \npeople of the day slack-jawed in shock.\n\n\nThe truth of the matter is that we've been beyond a second amendment world \nfor a very, *very* long time; we just haven't acknowledged it. The way the \namendment is currently worded, I find it difficult to imagine anybody \nallowing *any* restrictions on weapons. But I also know that nobody, \nprobably not even a libertarian, would argue for a citizen's right to own \nand operate an armed tank or a rocket launcher. The second amendment is \nalready being applied selectively; I think it's time we acknowledged that \nand drafted a new version appropriate to the times. \n\n\nUnfortunately, that will never happen as long as half the country deifies \nthe founders and regards the Constitution as a holy document akin to the \nBible."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1zTA86YsSp2sb80T55XqpQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "waterdamnaged", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ghfbjyvjhvnrr404chdbiowieehayf5w", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-08T14:24:08.960Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1zTA86YsSp2sb80T55XqpQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.32026200000000005, "formal_score": 80, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-08T14:24:08.960Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Pneb3TKUgw0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAo/UihYexuUSaU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110914854542198862154", "textDisplay": "+Walter Sobchak yes, and the US Constitution is no different in that \nregard.

That title undoubtedly goes to a \ncivilization that existed a very long time ago. I haven't decided which one \nit is specifically, as there are many factors to take into consideration, \nbut no current power is really anything to gawk at.\n\n\nThat being said, the US failed to take Canada, but the British Empire also \nfailed to take the US. The entire war amounted to the British not \nkidnapping US merchants from their ships, and that was only a result of the \nNapoleonic Wars coming to a close. It was ultimately a draw. Yeah, the \ncapital was burned down, but it's just a city; it's not that big a deal. \nThat's what President Lincoln kept saying to his Generals in the Civil War.\n\n\nSpeaking of the American Civil War, you are right in saying that there \nweren't many good generals on the Union side, as they all went to fight for \nthe Confederacy. Grant was practically the only one worth noting, aside \nfrom General Chamberlain, who has a pretty cool story behind him. General \nSherman was committing the Scorched Earth version of Total War. He was \ntaking out the places the Confederacy was getting their resources from. It \nis very controversial, but it was very effective.\n\n\nYou say the US did basically nothing in WWI. You are basically right; \nhowever, the US was supplying Britain with contraband throughout the war. \nIt only joined because the RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-Boat. In my \nopinion, the US should never have gotten involved in the war at all. Let \nEuropean problems stay European problems.\n\n\nGreat Britain was certainly something to see during WWII. Sticking it out \nand not being conquered at all... because it is an island nation. If \nBritain were connected to the mainland, it would have fallen. That's not to \nsay that Britain was not essential to the Allied victory, it was; very much \nso.\n\n\n\"the USA only softened up the Japanese...\" Very wrong. The US practically \nhandled the Pacific Theatre on its own. Australia was almost invaded, but \nwas stopped by the US. The US kept pushing Imperial Japan back to the main \nislands, not Australia. By \"blasting them to bits,\" you are either \nreferring to fighting Japan in general, or the nuclear bombs. The US had to \nuse bombs so much because Japan knew how to build a bunker. The nukes could \nhave been avoided, at the cost of a joint land invasion of Japan by the US \nand Russia, which would have wasted a LOT of lives. Imperial Japan did not \nsurrender in battle, my friend. You want to talk about dishonorable, look \nto Japan, who ironically thought their actions \"honorable.\"\n\n\nVietnam was terrible."}}]}, "z13yunuzno3rv14bp04cffwa4qmbhnfr0s00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsZpOfTX-LphNqAwOzwo9OQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "chauncy primm", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-20T06:17:18.620Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCsZpOfTX-LphNqAwOzwo9OQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.19453999999999999, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-12-20T06:17:18.620Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106208053812358606452", "textDisplay": "The xenophobia thing was very big here in the US .

After they fire \none of two things will happen they will either look back with a huge grin \non their face or with fear if it's fear then you haven't lost anything if \nit's joy then teach them about firearm safety and then being up the \nConstitution :) \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13wt5diry2tdj23r221exnpzqn1v3wpb04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVKuARUu3BJT522XfcRQH6Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "agentsmith123123", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-22T13:37:17.287Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCVKuARUu3BJT522XfcRQH6Q"}, "sentiment_score": 0.25398800000000005, "formal_score": 76, "updatedAt": "2015-09-22T13:37:17.287Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115438355441262625434", "textDisplay": "every body always throws out the hypothetical that the entire military \nwould be against 1 guy with his gun. the fact is chances are if the \ngovernment went tyrannical they would be dealing with hundreds of thousands \nof people with there guns. and most likely portions of the military would \ncooperate with the people. and we would be more likely facing the UN rather \nthan just the US military. and it would be very possible the people would \ndevelop an ally like we did with France in the American revolution. and you \nshould see the American people being obsessed with their bill of rights and \nevery aspect of it that includes the right to bear arms. and you should \nalso see guns as a necessary tool for a free people.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z134frcpyyi3efp2222tebfbhlrjhf0sj": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBxXuBIdUBO6xOmYm-EwAJw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3jfao_81VR4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARQ/6wrMgz-B65g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Noe Berengena", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-06T17:35:15.015Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBxXuBIdUBO6xOmYm-EwAJw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.28338400000000002, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-05-06T17:35:15.015Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113871124439375734108", "textDisplay": "It is certainly an American standard to have serious topics presented by \npeople who talk and behave like nitwits.

Yes many early colonists were Puritans but \neven that doesn\u2019t explain it. What does religion usually ask of a man or \nwoman?  To look above themselves for a higher cause for their lives. This \noften requires that person to repress or control the animal urges within \nevery man and woman. Not that these urges are necessarily bad but if they \nget out of control, havoc can be wrought on a person\u2019s life. Religious \npeople understand the duality of humanity\u2019s nature, part animal, part \nspiritual and all too human. Since religious people understand this they \ntry to control or repress modern society\u2019s all out assault on sexuality. \nThis appears to be repression but is a natural reaction to the \neverything-all-the-time part of society. Sex and sexuality are thrown in \nour faces all day every day and if you don\u2019t like it too bad and guess \nwhat, you have to accept and condone anything you don\u2019t like as normal and \nokay because I have the right to violate your rights.

The so called Japanese \nperson claiming to not understand why we have guns, they probably made up \nthe character. They picked a subject near and dear to the leftist effort to \ndisarm Americans and slice up the first of all Constitutional rights. For \nthose who really don't know why the 2nd Amendment of the right to bear arms \nis so important, it's very simple. just look at the American Revolution and \nDeclaration of Independence. The 2nd Amendment was NOT to protect hunting \nand target practice, it is intended to kill other human beings. \nSpecifically, a tyrant that takes away our Constitutional rights. In the \nDeclaration it says we have the right and duty to fight a government that \nhas become a tyrant. An example would be the type of government that TYT \nwould like installed.\n\n I have an idea, how about TYT do a survey on what Americans think of TYT? \nThe most common example is TYT are traitors to the American people, our \ndemocracy and our Constitution. We won't see that of course, TYT is way too \nbusy making up crap and telling half truths and lies.\n\nThomas\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []},

Many Americans who \nlean toward 'the left' in political ideology are feared by the media (also \nmainly left-leaning), so they're more than likely not willing to ever go \nsee what it's like to shoot a gun. This is the imbalance of power we see \ntoday in the US and usually how many mass shooters get away with killing a \nlot of people *who choose not to arm themselves!*\n\nAnyway, when I first shot a gun, I did not feel \"powerful\" or \"unstoppable\" \nat all, personally. I respected the gun as a powerful tool and just wanted \nto see how accurate my first shots were at the range. I was paying way more \nattention to handling the gun safely: *finger off trigger until aimed at \ntarget I'm willing to shoot*, keeping the gun pointed down range *at all \ntimes*; treating the gun as if it's loaded at all times, and etc.\n\nIt all depends on the individual, I guess. Many get excited after shooting \nguns, as I saw in another YouTube video of left-leaning people going to the \ngun range for the first time, but I did not get excited like a child at all \nmy first time. :)\n\n\nAbout the people wanting guns to fight off a possible tyrannical, fascist \ngovernment takeover in the future: They have a good mindset to think this \nway, as the 'founding fathers' wanted us armed just for that. What, \nexactly, do you think the *2nd Amendment of the US Constitution is all \nabout?*\n\n\nAnd, yes, it's true that the American military is very strong, though not \nguaranteed that all soldiers within that military would even choose to fire \non citizens of their own country, seeing as how they already have family \nhere as well; many will not obey such a criminal order to begin with, but \nfor those who would, well I'd say that 50 million citizens armed would be \nquite a bit to take on at once, even if the military uses tanks... we're \ntalking *FIFTY MILLION ARMED CITIZENS* here.\n\n\nAnyway, we should have \"assault rifles\" to begin with, as apart of our \nmilitia weaponry, at the least. Anything stronger and I'd understand that \nit'd be best to keep it locked up only for emergencies, but others would \nthink this is \"insane\" for citizens to own rocket launchers and such. lol! \nMaybe better for local law regulations, though the person still owns it as \nhis/her private property for totally emergencies.\n\n\nCall it crazy but without this type of mindset, the 'founders' would've \nnever won the Revolutionary War back 230+ years ago. They recognized that \nWe The People must remain armed to keep the balance of power intact. All \nfirepower in the government and you have tyranny reigning over us.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z134dlwrvzfnvvtf1220ez4gvxivfhlll": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-C7sY9Rg4T4j3V003AprA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OmUbPOQx9vg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB4/Gsujk7N-Z7g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "\u79cb\u5c71\u6faa", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-16T03:40:50.870Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCL-C7sY9Rg4T4j3V003AprA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.60951, "formal_score": 41, "updatedAt": "2015-10-16T03:40:50.870Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117290043737799580341", "textDisplay": "i'm very pro public transit, as it is better for the environment and \nefficient, comparing japan to the U.S.A or Canada, it is so much better in \njapan, i hate traveling in north america, are spend hours being \nuncomfortable in a car or truck going from one city to another, it is so \nmuch slower and less reliable then rail systems, and you can also end up \nwaiting in a highway for an hour not able to do anything, i hate the \nconcept of individual cars it is just so inconvenient and annoying\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12lsblx5kndijr4l04cjxxbjpqkh3np13k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUYOBCB1Ch5qESgyGVogbbQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ft7DAsFLcuU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJg/7c7V5R547B4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 7.6923076923076925, "authorDisplayName": "xOxOShelleyxOxO xOxOQuevedoxOxO", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-22T03:55:59.911Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUYOBCB1Ch5qESgyGVogbbQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.76065999999999989, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-22T03:55:59.911Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117326996541466931556", "textDisplay": "Who else was singing AMERICA FUCK YEAH!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12hyfaxqwjji1rqc04cezmb5mbkulfxwz40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXdD9OJNYFQHEnCv7BX8lw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fa_DN2qGgBc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEc/EVz_D1Oj8QE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "tham pun", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-20T15:02:36.403Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZXdD9OJNYFQHEnCv7BX8lw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.26941999999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-20T15:02:36.403Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105598988403568742354", "textDisplay": " junk FOODS, but with DIET drinks = American.... \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ww1dr1uyujnd5004cdb2ylmvpivaxy34": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5KNlTpWT8MDf72rT2AoYoQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SDIrRtmjcEE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEc/i42q_zOXd5s/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.95011876484560565, "authorDisplayName": "Sexxistentialist", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-18T08:26:07.986Z", "videoId": "BhvTc4euYXQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5KNlTpWT8MDf72rT2AoYoQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.72499000000000002, "formal_score": 76, "updatedAt": "2015-08-18T08:26:07.986Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103219165436624643123", "textDisplay": "Why do you call it \"soccer\" instead of football since \"football\" requires \nthe use of the feet and not the hands.

Okay, to be \nfair, yes, we do teach our kids that our country is the most peaceful, the \nmost right country in the world.

They have so much things to be proud of and can overpower any \ncountry anyway. In all honesty, I think we would act just like you, if not \nworse, if we happen to live in a country as advanced as the US.\n\nHowever, I still don't understand why public transport system in the US is \nreally bad. I've ever heard that the car manufacturer bribe the government \nnot to give its citizen proper transportation system so that the demand for \ncar rise up.
