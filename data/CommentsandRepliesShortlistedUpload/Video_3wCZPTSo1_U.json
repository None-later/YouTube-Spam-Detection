It seems to me that what is beneficial to us as social beings \nis also served by our biology. However, nature only lends a helping hand - \nsome things we must do for ourselves. And so I think that human sex is a \nphysical, emotional and cognitive act all at the same time and one of the \nnatural products is bonding between the couple. This is more than reptilian \nand does not arise from psychological dysfunction but from normal human \nfunction. And so whatever else nature gives us in terms of granting and \ngratifying sexual urges, it also helps us to be virtuous. But, certainly, \nnature is not enough.\n\nWhen considering the necessity of cultivating virtue, I like the Ancient \nGreek understanding which identifies a human moral faculty as inherent as \nevery other human faculty (e.g. the capacity to learn language.) However, \nthe Greeks understood that like all such capacities it needs to be trained \nin order to reach its full potential. I don't think we have a reptilian \nnature that we need to escape, but a human nature that we need to nurture \nand perfect. The reptilian for a human being IS dysfunction.\n\nI often find myself in discussions with people who want to tell me about \nreptiles and ducks and bonobos and chimpanzees and the like as if this will \nhelp me to understand myself better. I fear these comparisons are more \nlikely to mislead than inform. Why?

So, a \nchild being shut-in by her parents because she is dangerous; that's a \nsituation you would probably only see in the case of a child with \npsychological problems.  If you frame it in that way, then almost every \nobservation is on-point.  \n\nOn the other hand, it does kind of take the fun out of fairy tales when you \ndo that.  I also don't think any of these things are the actual intended \nmeaning of the story.  Like J.R.R.

Close Encounters was no exception - the aliens \n\"communicated\" with humans telepathically.

Catwoman (uses her agility to become jewel thief)  So it becomes \nabout skill vs magic powers or super powers.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12jtvwo0ujovfzzd04chrup4vnpe35wnm40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHjP_EzlwKSPiegHqcSn_Ng", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Pill Harmonic", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-11T21:45:58.289Z", "videoId": "3wCZPTSo1_U", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHjP_EzlwKSPiegHqcSn_Ng"}, "sentiment_score": -0.66600999999999999, "formal_score": 88, "updatedAt": "2014-07-11T21:46:15.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117503864967027184181", "textDisplay": "You guys really hate narcissistic desire.

In her defense, she had no idea that her sister was going \nto cause winter for miles around, or out walk a horse, when she set out, \nso, there's that. \nFor balance's sake, I just wish they had had Elsa thaw out hans' heart at \nthe end, instead of sending him back shamed to his toxic family.

She is showered with gifts, told she \ncan do/be anything she wants, and watched as the men in her life are \ndeprived of even the most rudimentary needs, such as freedom and respect. \n(You could make the argument that dad has no choice, as the threat of \ndivorce ever looms over his head, but you must then ask yourself why he \nmarried a woman who gave plenty of clues to this life back when they were \nstill dating.) This girl grows into a narcissist. But what else could she \ngrow into, given her situation in life? Therefore, it is incumbent upon the \nrest of us real men to put them in their places. We cannot change their \npasts, but we can make there presents so miserable, that they will be \nforced to become decent human beings.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12vedpx5vzywlbuv23ru5pwyzekelfuh": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7F8JYS_s7G26YQ05EGSeBw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SK51vdRdS_k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFI/oombsqsKbkw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ryu Hayabusa", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-08T15:58:36.627Z", "videoId": "3wCZPTSo1_U", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7F8JYS_s7G26YQ05EGSeBw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.66122799999999993, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-06-08T15:58:36.627Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101014273428062658718", "textDisplay": "\"The universe is hostile\nSo impersonal\nDevour to survive\nSo it is, so it's always been\"      \n\nHow do we live in peace ? ...make a religion ...make anarchy\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ft3kpbw3isvh05220s33wzpigtfjsk": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ8nS0M8hep3fPziNfX8iYg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P2HFMIF8GJo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAhU/1eKzYxNcT-0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Shaman Dragon (SHA DRA)", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-16T14:23:14.758Z", "videoId": "3wCZPTSo1_U", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQ8nS0M8hep3fPziNfX8iYg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.73168799999999989, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-08-16T14:23:14.758Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111593214428682875339", "textDisplay": "magic represents the imagination\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z125e1uzys2bclbtp23fwf0hvrustlytg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQwypKe-khtbl7re3vwTAPA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--twQ9zFfKEo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAcM/wl1bxG7Bl_w/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jesse Collin", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-20T04:32:12.148Z", "videoId": "3wCZPTSo1_U", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQwypKe-khtbl7re3vwTAPA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.90949380000000002, "formal_score": 66, "updatedAt": "2015-02-20T04:32:12.148Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114950743900570121080", "textDisplay": "Awesome.

The troll wipes elsa's memory of her own powers at 11:55 in an attempt \nto cure her \"madness\" \n \nThis is obviously 100% not true, the troll only uses his powers on anna.  \n \n2. 35:25 Stefan claims that anna saves kristoph, and shows her dexterity \nand prowess in combating wolves and riding sleds. This is ridiculous, if \nyou watch the scene you can see that the reason kristoph falls of the sled \nis because of anna swinging a guitar at him, furthermore is clear anna has \nnothing to do with the piloting of the sled as sven is an experience \nreindeer and anna does not even touch the reigns during the entire \nsequence. \n \n3. Afterwards stefan goes on to claim that the women in the movie are \nportrayed as effortless masters. This is shown to not be the case as anna \nrequires kristoph to save her by throwing her to sven and coordinating a \njump across the chasm. Later on anna shows her ineptitude during a \nrock-climbing sequence. And off the top of my head she also shows her \nweakness in snowman combat by first aggravating marshmallow, then flicking \nhim with a tree in an attempt to defeat him. Both of which are met with \ndisastrous results.  \n4.  At about 17:00 stefan goes on to rant about how the girls are having \nshallow conversation and are not fit to truly rule the kingdom. He of \ncourse disregards the fact that these girls had terrible parents who locked \none girl away in her room for most of her life and told her to be afraid of \nherself and her power. And the other was locked away without explanation! \nanna was kept in the castle without social interaction and presumably a \ngood deal of conditioning for the leadership role she may one day take as \nwell as elsa. Of course the girls are going to be unfit for rule, the role \nis thrust upon them (much like the assumed phallic status of the rod and \norb from the coronation). \n \nI made another post in the comments here, I don't know how to link it \nhowever."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy5335sguUmYmULSW_0kZqQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheKiosk94", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qgxxhypu4fpwwl04cj3yiauqug1mr1qg0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-05T01:28:15.806Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCy5335sguUmYmULSW_0kZqQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46550000000000002, "formal_score": 17, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-06-05T01:28:15.806Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109265132250087365298", "textDisplay": "+onlyashadow1121\nPlease list them.

So unless you're completely \ninsane or entirely ignorant, this couldn't be the aim of your replies. \nLet's explore another possibility...\n\n2) Whether or not you truly believed I was all of a, b, c, d, and e: you \nwere in no way interested in confirming, but rather, you saw someone get \nmocked and reflexively and egotistically (see: self-righteously) decided to \nrepay the perceived evil with an evil gesture of your own. This in the form \nof an insult to someone who just made an insult. This seems to make more \nsense than the first possibility because it would explain the irrational \n(i.e. purely insulting and inaccurate) and arrogant nature of the replies.\nPut another way: It would explain why you took it upon yourself to \ninsultingly chime in in the first place, AND it would explain why each \nreply has become more intense, dismissive and obstinate in subsequent \nreplies.\n\nIn light of this, you have to ask yourself whether you feel very very \nfoolish and idiotic for chiming into an argument with someone you wish to \ndo nothing but harm to, (and this because you believe you saw him do harm \nto another!?) ...\n\nYou're lucky to have me, Thag"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJdqB8quaMdIFLRvQHO9Ahw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Thagomizer", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125gbvwvpuhwbykh22egrhr3pnhxz13d", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-19T06:11:44.211Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJdqB8quaMdIFLRvQHO9Ahw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.75341600000000009, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-19T06:11:44.211Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104496727361272064376", "textDisplay": "When did any of posts imply that I even considered you an adult, let alone \nsomeone worth debating?

HELL I even know what it \nis to suffer mental illness, only to be told bu my parents to ignore it. \nHOWEVER, despite all of this I feel like I have learned more lessons from \neverything that has happened in my life. Thank you so much for posting \nthis. Honestly I want to make a difference in the world, and I looked to \npeople like you to sort of guide me in the right direction. THANKS SO MUCH.\n\n\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13zhtrj1nvvytaby04civ04sl3xsf3ylzk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwQQ-ApFRYID_y3E0JFBycA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IjHkQvrzDXY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAATI/n8oScx7AOU0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ellie b", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-10T08:20:55.348Z", "videoId": "3wCZPTSo1_U", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwQQ-ApFRYID_y3E0JFBycA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.70347599999999999, "formal_score": 7, "updatedAt": "2014-06-10T08:20:55.348Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115283044721206473362", "textDisplay": "I'm really confused.

I live in mediocrity and have \nillusions of grandeur because I am smart. I attend Community College, where \nI attend for free on government financial aid. I am a horrible student, I \nnever study until the day of an exam, yet I have illusions of grandeur \nconcerning my own ability to accomplish my goals and the honest chances i \nhave of graduating and transferring to a top college in the US. I am smart, \nI get A's and B's mostly without trying hard (attendance is my biggest \ndetractor in grades). I am just lazy academically. I recently switched my \nmajor to a Liberal Arts: math and science concentration, where I coast by \nin all classes except physics. I am horrible at physics, I regularly get \n25% on physics exams and tests because I just don't put in the hours to \nstudy. When I try to read my text book I eventually lose focus and go off \nand do something else. Yet I still feel entitled to getting into \nprestigious schools through out the country. This video just bitch slapped \nme. I know I am slacking, not treating my studies like a job, and expecting \nto get rewards without putting in the effort. I have mediocre habits and it \nreally pisses me off. I really want more from myself. I have to man the \nhell up and bare down on the mind numbing physics text book and do it. I \ncannot suffer to live in an illusion where I can coast by on innate talents \nI was born with, and I am so mad at myself that THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE \nBEEN DOING! I plan on getting a dual degree in Geology and Civil \nEngineering, and I keep expecting that when I transfer and am finally in \nthe different school and environment that I will snap to it and be better. \nHowever based on my current habits, I just won't. I can't bear to get by \neasily anymore, especially because I will be responsible for thousands of \npeoples lives in the future. I desperately do not want to be a shit bag. It \nwas very hard to listen to the second half of this video, as I felt a ton \nof resistance to it, because you were talking about me Stephan. I have to \ngo through the pain of growing and learning new skills, and I constantly \nput it off and procrastinate on it. This video made me very mad at myself \nand I now have this pent up anger to go open that damn book and not leave \nit.\n\n   I do not know where I would be without these shows done by Mike, the \nresearch crew, and you Stephan. They are not only my North Star, they also \nteach me how to use the damn sextant. I am borderline homeless poor, but I \nas soon as I am able to sustain myself financially yours will be the first \norganization that gets a check. Of five or maybe even ten dollars! (I am \njoking).

I \nknow what it is like to work hard, I have had a job since I was 14. I \nworked pumping gas and landscaping over the summers, and worked at the \npublic library during the school year. I am used to physical labor, where \nit is easy to excel at a job because effort and results are much more \ndirectly correlated. I have worked myself out of homelessness already, and \nI worked 50 hours a week with a daily 8 hour commute to put my little \nbrother through school. It is not an issue with discipline. \n\nI've been through a lot of craziness; the school environment just does not \nfill me with fear of negative consequences for a missed classes or not \nstudying. I am just feeling it now because I am starting to see how my \nfuture is in jeopardy just when I figured out what it is going to be.\n\nJust as a side note, I just wanted say (at the risk of sounding like a \ndick, apologies) that the 10,000 hour rule is to achieve mastery in a \ndiscipline. Malcolm Gladwell himself said how the concept gets \nmisconstrued. It has actually been researched that to pick up a new habit \nand become decent in a discipline only requires about 20 hours of effort. \nThe 10,000 hours thing is mostly about finding the appropriate challenge \nfor your skill level, which is the most time consuming part of the process, \nand it can be shortened if the process is streamlined. People have gone \nfrom novice to grand master chess players in 4,000 hours practice using \nonline chess because the matchmaking algorithms place players against \nopponents of similar skill level. You don't get that in sports or martial \narts or solitary pursuits so much, so it takes longer to advance in skill.\n\nSorry, I always write a lot, its deeply ingrained habit. Also I know I was \ndefensive, I wanted to clarify my situation a bit. It doesn't mean I don't \nvalue what you said, because I really do. I always enjoy the camaraderie \nthat comes from other guys that know the struggle of being in the shit. \nHenry V Crispen's day speech and all. Those not in the shit shall hold \ntheir manhoods cheap that they were not there to twiddle in the suck with \nthe merry band of brothers. I really do get you brother."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh13-tDdeHBspUslUtTVbvA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Vincente Sanchez", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ocpfxdmyyfvo1g22rijpotymnzhav3", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-06T22:47:32.534Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCh13-tDdeHBspUslUtTVbvA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.48045200000000005, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-06-06T22:47:32.534Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VlePFLi4lxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWc/_7fUDKjmaEA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111670838829623377224", "textDisplay": "+BarringtonDailey For your viewing pleasure I have restructured it into \nparagraphs.

Who you think you are is a construct of \nparenting, assimilation to your friends and the microculture you've grown \nup in. Most decisions of who you are were made by other people. It's not \ngenetic. Now it's your turn to make yourself. Decide today to do things, \nnot as you normally would, do them as Stephen would. No f***ing excuses! Do \nor don't. Experiment with little innocuous decisions. Something you \nroutinely do. Go right where you would normally go left, physically, \nmentally and/or politically.\n\nAs a kid I lived \"kind of\" on a farm. I shoveled shit. I had chores most \nmornings at 6 am before school. In high school during summers I worked \nmaintenance. I cleaning bogers off spoiled rich kids desks and cleaning \ntoilets for $4.50 an hour. I hated it then but I am appreciated it now. No \ndiscipline was not an option.\n\nThe benefit of having a rational mind is you can benefit from understanding \nsomeone's experience.

I can see you \ncare deeply about the effects of all of this and it pains you that it's \nbeing spoon fed to ALL of us. By virtue of what your commenting on, really, \nit's GOING to piss off the majority of the people who come across it, as \nwithout real honesty into how we're all part of such paradigms, and \nsincerity without being offended by the parts of it we could change but \nusually do NOT, it's an attack on the viewer themselves, or rather, they \nwill feel it is. Because really, anything that is complacent in the viewer \nwith perpetuating these mechanisms in themselves, is supporting it, and if \nwe're honest, then we're going to be resentful of being called on it. But \nas the saying goes, \"by doing nothing you have already committed.\"\n\nI'm wondering, for those who can't quite follow what you're really saying \nhere (and reading the comments on here I see most can't or get lost in \nsemantics), or find themselves reacting too much to your own experiences of \nthese things you are commentating on, if there is something you COULD \npresent, following something like this, that takes up a more \npositive-attack on these issues you care about. Such as an alternative \nviewpoint or \"storyline\" -I.E. what COULD the writers have done, to avoid \nor make this a healthier movie for little children, or people in general? \nObviously the writer was a complete moron and had NO idea they were just \nregurgitating the crap they were spoon fed, at best (or intentionally \nmeaning to create something like this to inseminate into our children's \nlives via their imagination using the wonderful and incredibly powerful \nmedium of images and songs)... but what COULD the story have held and shown \nthat might have offset some of the damaging things and dysfunction either \nby showing a different relationship, structure or dialog, that might have \nchanged all this?\n\nAnd what possibly could an average person, who sees this movie, and - man \nor woman - notices these same things and is somehow uncomfortable with it \n(but perhaps not quite aware of why) -what could someone like that DO to \noffset this kind of crap, if they objected to it? I.E. where is a GOOD \nexample of what you think is wrong with the archetypes you see in this \nmedia? ARE there any healthy examples of princes is modern media, for \ninstance? What about healthy families or relationships in kid's movies like \nthis?\n\nMaybe an alternate storyline, and then an example of where you've seen that \nor how that exists somewhere else. Then the viewer can compare and begin to \nsee it for themselves, from an inner experience of these things that are \napparent to you, but they might not have the insight to face or be willing \nto look at so directly yet, or they see as personal attacks on their own \nchoices (and for good reason, but still). That would also help keep them \nfrom reacting to YOU so personally, and missing the whole point of what you \nso scathingly did the work deconstructed for them, ironically.

Through this you make the accusation of else \nbeing responsible for her parents death, CLEARLY this isn't the effect of \nelsa's powers as she controls only snow, cold, freezing and the like where \nas the parents died as a result of a storm at sea WHICH, STEFAN, contained \nnone of the icy elements elsa has control over and instead was a quite \nrainy and windy affair CHARACTERISTIC of a tropical storm which obviously \ncan occur only in warm waters. You are definitely drawing conclusions from \nmisinformation that you have fed yourself like so many grapes from the \nvine.  \n \n*edit: not to mention but elsa has not shown any ability to remotely \ncontrol the weather over long distances. The initial ice age she enacts on \narrendale is caused by a chain reaction of her freeze-touching everything \non the way out.

And I will tell you first and foremost, the involment of \nthe supernatural, magic or powers is not a message about descending into \nmadness, but a view of seeing the world where said powers could exist and \nmake you special or where said powers can exist and be considered mundane. \nthe magic existing in a fantasy world need not equal \"madness\" as that \nlogic makes it too simple, or perhaps too complex.\nthere are actually a few possibilities to these fantasy stories. while you \ndid strike a point, of possible anger and wanting an adventurous world, \nthis does not equal madness. someone may write about an unfairness in the \nworld and express it through powers. an example- x-men.  the big issue \nbeing the issue of racism/ not madness, in showing the idea of mutantes \n(those with special powers) vs humans (those without) and wishing to \ncoexist.\nor spiderman  with the notion \"with great power comes great \nresponsibility\".  his powers would be considered magic even if explained \noddly in his world. but the point of his powers is not that parker descends \ninto madness, but that he has a vast amount of ability and doesn't believe \nhe should abuse that ability. \nmy own fantasy writing is about a world I'd like to see which is highly \nviolent, but this isn't the madness of the characters. it's their actual \nworld. they all have powers, none of em are special in regards to their \npowers. they just channel them like martial arts and some use them better \nthan others. they fight and contest against one another in a struggle for \nsurvival.  this has nothing to do with madness or their world not being \nreal as far as the characters themselves go. so this honestly counters your \nargument that it is.\nso while you break down the idea of turning frozen into something without \npowers and all about delusions and abuse, I'm going to have to move on to a \nvideo where you aren't trying to break down a cartoon or fantasy world in \nrelation to psychosis. because not everything relates to psychosis, not as \nfar as writing goes. it could be a theme, but it is not the overarching \ntheme in a lot of things like harry potter,

While that can often be the case, magic can \nalso be defined as phenomena observed or experienced by some people (but \nnot necessarily everyone) which have not yet been adequately explained \nscientifically (rationally).\n\nJust as humans are prone to imagining magical phenomena where there is \nnone, it is JUST AS TRUE that humans are prone to explaining away magical \n(ie unexplained, but real) phenomena using seemingly rational but wholly \ninappropriate scientific explanations which do not really *explain* the \nphenomena in question at all.\n\nHuman experience has always been increasing at a faster rate than science \n(rationality) can explain or account for. The concept of 'magic' can be \nthought of NOT so much as an explanation, but rather as a placeholder until \nan suitable explanation can be figured out based on knowledge or data which \nwe do not yet posses.\n\nIt is not 'magic' that is at fault here, it is scientists who incorrectly \ndefine magic as a *explanation* rather than as a *placeholder in lieu of an \nexplanation* who are at fault here. When scientists dismiss 'magic' what \nthey are often doing is just refusing to admit they don't have an adequate \nexplanation either. Or you could say that when scientists come up with a \ncrappy explanation which not really explain the phenomena, they like to \npoint to a 'magical' explanation and say \"Hey, at least our explanation is \nbetter than that!\" .... but 'magic' is not an explanation, it is a \nplaceholder for an explanation in the absence of enough data and knowledge.\n\nIn many ways to call a genuinely unusual phenomenon 'magic' is more \naccurate (more scientific) than to insist it must have been the product of \nsome well established scientific process or mechanism, even when the data \ndoes not really fit.\n\nAt least the term 'magic' leaves the door open for further enquiry and a \npossible rational / scientific explanation in the future. But once you \nincorrectly define 'magical' (ie unusual) phenomena in mundane terms you \nclose that door forever.\n\nThe modern world is full of wonderful and terrifying observations of \n'magical phenomena' which have been effectively sealed off and quarantined \nby the establishment scientific community, which has defined them as \nmundane examples of ordinary science and nothing we should concern \nourselves with. Move along now.....\n\nAn incorrect scientific explanation is by far the worst example of a \n'superstition', and the hardest to budge once it is in place.\n\nThe opposite of superstition, rationality and delusion is NOT the claims \nmade by the scientific community. They are (with VERY FEW exceptions) just \npriests in white lab coats, that's all.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ccpprauadz5tyq04cddahlq3tut0rhvs0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrfGY6DYRHfgFc4gKvajIiA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "John Smith", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-05T11:19:51.734Z", "videoId": "3wCZPTSo1_U", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrfGY6DYRHfgFc4gKvajIiA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.13736799999999999, "formal_score": 97, "updatedAt": "2014-06-05T11:19:51.734Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112638018522761443002", "textDisplay": "Looks like our views on gender have been..frozen..since the 1800s..\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrfGY6DYRHfgFc4gKvajIiA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "John Smith", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ccpprauadz5tyq04cddahlq3tut0rhvs0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-05T11:20:26.579Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrfGY6DYRHfgFc4gKvajIiA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.47329400000000005, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-06-05T11:20:26.579Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112638018522761443002", "textDisplay": "*puts on sunglasses*"}}]}, "z13fft3bckvsyhsyc04cezyoqyayjrtj3rk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO1pb3NJZBU3YuazpO564A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5w7znHFGpYs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/4qrnXfiaZrE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Otto Otto", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-15T11:37:00.881Z", "videoId": "3wCZPTSo1_U", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYO1pb3NJZBU3YuazpO564A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.14801200000000003, "formal_score": 4, "updatedAt": "2014-07-15T11:37:00.881Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108191219610798305740", "textDisplay": "uhm @ about 50:30 this analyses all goes to ^%# for me it sounds like \nstefan thinks we ought not be giving health care shelter food and cash to \nthe pregnant ladys around us... hmmm. is that what you mean senior stefan \nmolyneux? i just want to know exactly what you think the right thing to do, \nthe sane thing to do is when it comes to caring for our poor young ladies? \ni think you sound just as nuts as the rest of us btw... and love but true \nlove is still just outside of your reach. maybe its offering that other \norgan after the jagged spoon incident... we grow them in peetree dishes \nnow.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO1pb3NJZBU3YuazpO564A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Otto Otto", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13fft3bckvsyhsyc04cezyoqyayjrtj3rk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-29T09:33:36.043Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYO1pb3NJZBU3YuazpO564A"}, "sentiment_score": 0.099777999999999978, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-29T09:33:36.043Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5w7znHFGpYs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/4qrnXfiaZrE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108191219610798305740", "textDisplay": "come on buddy, whats with hiding my questions under your adverts (\"The \nTruth About Frozen...\" & \"I love this.

How can kids understand them, let \nalone make sense of them all? The answer is, they can't. Adults giggle away \nduring the film's sexual innuendos thinking their kids are way too dumb to \nunderstand or see them and they don't even pay attention to all the dark \nthemes expressed in the film.

I'd go with Joesph Campbell on this, \"Myth is \nthe secret opening through which the inexhaustible energies of the cosmos \npour into human cultural manifestation. Religions, philosophies, arts, the \nsocial forms of primitive and historic man, prime discoveries in science \nand technology, the very dreams that blister sleep, boil up from the basic, \nmagic ring of myth.\"\n\nYes, as with all things, there is a downside to creativity, and that is why \n\"religion\" is on the list above. But prior to Darwin, what were people to \nthink? Gods were a creative way of addressing obviously important issues \nwith no explanation (like the complex design of living beings). \n\nStar Trek has inspired many technologists, and the line between high \ntechnology and magic is very thin, as Clarke pointed out. Star Trek too is \nmythology.\n\nMy own interpretation of the movie? Else's magic represents the creativity \nand independence within all of us. The repression by her parents is the \nsurface values, materialism, and statism that are threatened by her inner \npower of being who she really is -- a free and creative being. Her parents \nshaming her magic, is the attempt to make her conform to social values, \nreligion, etc.. Her sister represents those who are \"freedom kin\" whose \nlove and recognition help her to manifest her creativity in a positive \nmanner, rather than through the twisted process of rigid social systems \nthat don't honor individuality, or the twisted anger of having been shamed \nfor being herself.\n\nAll that said, I think Stef makes some very interesting points along the \nway... there are a lot of distorted concepts that are common to Hollywood \nplots tarnishing the inspiring core story of individuation.

Who murdered your sense of imagination? Look, I really liked \nFrozen unapologetically and even found it personally motivating, inspiring, \nand refreshing against the backdrop of patriarchal fairy tales. To see a \nfemale lead who understands that love is more than just marrying a man and \nthat self-confidence can overcome fear and drive one to accomplish great \nthings. To know that whatever your past may be, you don't have to be \nenslaved to it because it is the present that that is where all potential \nlies.\n\nBefore seeing Frozen, I railed against it because I thought it would be \nterrible, but was pressured against my will to see it until watching a few \nseconds of Let It Go and had a total change of heart. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I appreciate your analysis and insight and the \ncounterbalance it applies to something that is so very seductive. But I am \nleft wondering about your own mental well-being because you don't just \nattack Frozen but ALL magic and science fiction as being madness and \nirrationality. Do you in turn think all artists and writers are irrational \nand insane if what they portray is anything but 100% realism?\n\n\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" ~ \nClarke's 3rd Law.\n\nI myself hold the definition that \"magic is science we haven't discovered \nyet.\" Not that I believe it's sane to go jump off buildings and hope you \ncan fly but that I don't believe reality AS WE UNDERSTAND IT is the end all \nof knowledge and truth. That life is far straight Germany than what \nempiricism has brought us SO FAR. If you care to wait for peer reviewed \nquantum so I entity to tell you \"we are all one,\" that's well and good but \npeople of faith figured that out thousands of years ago and wondered why it \ntook you so long to catch up.\n\nImagination is not just mental illness but practical. Gene Rodenberry \nimagined the Hysenburg Compensator and not science is close to making one. \nHenry Ford dreamed of a V8 engine when his best scientists told him it was \nimpossible.

So when we see the \n\"ice melting\" at the end it's the hope of the people that Elsa's madness is \nover.

Though I don't think magic equals madness in every \nfairy tale. I rather think magic means power. \n\nThese ancient fairy tales are not just violent narcissistic fantasies, but \nprofound life lessons in the language of the unconscious and dreams. \nUnfortunately this projection of the unconscious is a shallow lesson for \ngirls perfectly mirroring our current culture.\n\nStrange how all these current heroines come from a dysfunctional family. \nLike in \u201cFriends with Benefits\u201d, which also very very accurately mirroring \nthe current trends, interestingly the girl there didn\u2019t have a father to \nbegin with and her mother was sleeping with everybody, yet she was \nperfectly normal and adorable in the film. I suspect this movies are \ndistorted in a way, that it shows how the heroines perceive themselves, but \ntheir true nature is hidden even from herself. In Frozen also Anna was \ncompetent in every possible sense. It only shows girls just don\u2019t invest in \nself-discovery and the culture encourage them to be carefree.\n\nThe roles men fulfilled in this movie is a subject of shame. See, every \niteration of fairy tales, the heros, the masculine is losing power, and \nmore more lame. Just how it starts, we don\u2019t have one princess, we have \ntwo. It is not a female-male relationship and how they save each other, but \nhow two girl save each other. There is no real room for men here. Secondly. \nThe hard-working men only mine a little ice, while she can frost the entire \ncontinent, without even looking. Christoph doesn\u2019t have a chance to kiss \nand save Anna. She save herself. Christoph is a bystander and stands \ndumbfounded, when the two girl save converts from dead to alive again. He \nis out of synch. And then timidly ask for permission to have a kiss. The \npower dynamics are restored that he is again with the lower value and went \nfrom an acting force to a permission seeking victim, even he had proved \nhimself numerous times.\n\nI am with Stefan\u2019s conclusion absolutely, that this flick favors abusive \nrelationship into real ones. There is no balance between masculine and \nfeminine in the end. No union in the usual sense. The 2 girls will rule the \nland, with their powers, but where is the masculine emotional control? What \nif \u201clove\u201d and other positive emotions goes away?

Gravity is still \nsomething we have yet to fully understand. That doesn't change how \nuniversal it is however; even if we don't comprehend it entirely, we know \nenough of its basic principles so far to be able to test it time and again \nwithout the result changing, save in a few specific circumstances where \ncertain materials are near each other (bismuth and a regular magnet \nhowever), in which case we have reason for the exception that is also \nunchanging, no matter what we say.\nNumbers, for the purposes of language and measurement, are made up symbols. \nHow else are we expected to measure anything? And though numbers are made \nup symbols, the properties they are used to measure do exist. If one cat \nwalks into another room with another cat, there are now two cats. However, \nif three cats walked into a room with five cats, we do not suddenly have \none cat. We have eight cats, no matter what you try to say. We are able to \napply a made up number system to reality because reality responds in \npredictable, unchanging ways to our conclusions with said number system \n(possibly barring theoretical math, as I have no knowledge about such \nformulas).\nThe universe may not 'care' about organic is and is not, but that doesn't \nchange the fact that such exist, with or without the word 'organic' being \nused or known. There are plants, animals, cells, and bacteria which must \ntake in energy in order to survive, while rocks, soil, plastic, and atoms \n(just to name a few) are not organic because they do not require energy in \norder to survive and only react to forces acting on them; they do not act \nindependently. Again, nothing we say or believe will change tat, no matter \nhow we try to redefine the meaning of words (which is just our way of \ntrying to express our understanding of the world).\nA statement such as \"the grass is green\" is not identical to the above \nstatements. Such is based purely on our perception of the light that is not \nabsorbed by the grass, which can change if one is colorblind. The \nstatements I put forward, however, would stay the same, whether or not we \ncan perceive it.\nAlso if I may make a comment on the brain: though it may have developed \nsolely for our survival and reproduction, it is capable of other things, \nsuch as understanding. Just because it was made for one purpose doesn't \nmean it can't serve another, though it may have more issue with alternate \npurposes. That, however, doesn't make it incapable."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCt8D9Jn_Va2UhL5miOyig", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Drudenfusz", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12dul2wksvcw1lnr221vz2yzpelcxurj04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-05T10:35:37.349Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTCt8D9Jn_Va2UhL5miOyig"}, "sentiment_score": 0.043852000000000002, "formal_score": 75, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-06-05T10:35:37.349Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oJMqGEPfxlg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAG8/_8tWr4E8Gg4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105563840395137785018", "textDisplay": "+DBArtsCreators Gravity exists, sure, but the pull is in both directions \nnot just in the direction of the larger body, the larger body simply has \nmore pull (overall that is a structure of reality, and we still struggle to \ncome up with a pattern that explains everything about gravity). 1+1=2 is \ncompletly made up, there are no inherent numbers in objects in reality, we \nonly assign those, maths is is just a system that we apply unto reality, \nthe universe doesn't make maths, we do.

His review of Maleficent was \nright on, and not coincidentally matched my reaction as I left the theater.\n\nBut his perception of Frozen seems plain silly to me. Associating fantasy \nand magic with mental illness is a very different take on things that I've \nnever seen or heard before. It's fine as a metaphor, but the movie's \nnarrative loses substance if you take it beyond that.\n\nTo me, the song \"Let it Go\" relates to coming out of the closet. Elsa's \nkept part of herself hidden from the rest of the world, keeping it to \nherself. She was afraid of how others would react, and so kept herself and \nher magic (her sexuality) hidden from others. She tried to be what others \nexpected her to be, but when her secret is discovered, she embraces who she \ntruly is and is empowered by it.\n\nBeing an asexual who has come out of the closet this year, that scene \nreally hit home for me. That said, I view this more as a metaphor than \nanything else. Elsa is singing about her magic powers, not her sexuality. A \ncigar is just a cigar.

She \ndoes AMAZINGLY dangerous things like ride bicycles on *stair railings* and \nthey either dare not to, or care not to, stop her.  Bear in mind this is \none of only 2 royals still alive.  So either the servants don't care if the \nline dies out, or they actively desire that this royal house gets replaced \nby another.

"+shadyparadox\n\nClearly you misunderstand what's being presented. These \"conspiracy\" \ntheories that stefan is \"making up\" aren't for the intellectual adult mind, \nthey're targeted at very young audiences because they soak up everything \nshown and given to them at a rate that puts all adults to shame.\n\nChildren learn and comprehend multitudes faster than adults ever could, \nbecause their brains are still growing and fluid, they haven't settled into \nthe shape and form that adulthood brings.\n\nKids not getting and understanding these things is by design. If your child \nsteals a cookie and you smack or spank them, they don't necessarily \nunderstand why you punish them in such a way, but they do understand \nconsequence of action.\n\nIf a very young child is exposed to media and social conditioning telling \nthem that marriage is a living hell, say by having dysfunctional parents, \nor parents who never say they love eachother or get along very often in \nfront of the child or talk about love dying or fading with time, they will \nsubconsciously associate love and marriage with a gradual degradation of \nhappiness, not wanting any part of it.\n\nThey won't fully understand why until later in their lives by hindsight and \ninsight.\n\nAs adults, we can look at our childhoods in retrospect, deduce why we feel \ncertain ways about certain things.\n\nTo end, the only full family unit we see in Frozen is the royal family, as \nStefan points out, and they're ashamed of their children, never get along \nall that well, are abusive and neglectful, and ignorant of the finer points \nof parenthood and in general common sense.\n\nThe only other family we hear about is Hans's, and that's also made out to \nbe horrible and something nobody would want.\n\nMeanwhile everyone else seems normal, the non full family units, everyone \nwho isn't married with children, are shown to be more content than the \nfamilies.\n\nChildren will not understand why they don't see any functioning familial \nunit, but they will see and subconsciously associate a full committed \nfamily with negative things.\n\nIf a child only ever sees their parents fighting, they will subconsciously \nassociate marriage, love, and being a family with misery. The same way that \nvery young girls seeing this movie will learn to subconsciously associate \nwell off, charming, and handsome boys and young men with evil and deceit, \nbetrayal and selfish lies.\n\nThis movie, and by extension, media like it, is the way it is by \nintelligent design, not happenstance or coincidence."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQzndIuuKQ_2TcCiVYwPHzw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "cheeryouUPfred", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13czvrjglymfzweu23wythy2yu1d5cu5", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-25T07:14:34.302Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQzndIuuKQ_2TcCiVYwPHzw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.75904400000000005, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-25T07:14:34.302Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oXSMby6hMQw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJU/I1WOgWcl0v4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110216128417963810794", "textDisplay": "behavioral patterns repeat themselves, however.

And a \nfilm reviewer reviews everything a film has, including visuals, songs, \ncomedy, and characters from a plot and entertainment perspective. Majority \nof Stefan's \"review\" is just on his philosophical analysation of the film. \nI even said multiple times how I doubt the writers would've put a whole lot \nof philosophical depth in this film since they probably wanted to make a \nkids film. I also doubt they would put magic in as a metaphor for madness, \nbut more as a plot element. And not every writer-especially for a kids \nfilm- would try to put philosophy in their films in the first place. Maybe, \nthey had another intention for some of those scenes Stefan talked about. If \nall of Stefan's BS was true, then Disney would've gotten a ton of lawsuits \nfrom overprotective parents and certain companies. \"But our society is \nbrainwashed\".

It seems all you're doing is shoving Stefan's opinion down my throat \nbecause you never saw the film, and you're gonna believe everything he \nsays. So when he says that pigs are smarter than humans, I guess I'll be \nseeing you again bowing down and obeying his every command. How about you \nlearn what an \"opinion\" is before commenting because all you know how to do \napparently is prolong an argument. All of this started because you refused \nto accept the fact that I had a different view on Frozen and you wanted to \ndefend your god Stefan.

I shouldn't even talk to you \nabout Elsa's uncontrollable powers anymore then since you haven't seen the \nfilm. Of course, if you saw the Let it Go music video and not the whole \nfilm, you would think Elsa is in control when she wasn't.

That means he won't be right about everything. What if a dog \nbites a human child? Does that dog have some distaste for humans? Was he \nscared? Was he playing around when that happened? Or is there something \ndeeper to this incident? These are all interpretations, and sometimes, \nthese stay as interpretations, not confirmed 100% true facts. So Stefan is \njust interpreting the entire Frozen film from a Philosophical viewpoint \n(which also makes him a not-so-good-film reviewer). Maybe watch the film \n1st, then you can hopefully form an opinion on it. And next time, \nunderstand the difference between solid evidence and interpreted evidence. \nBecause looking at something from a philosophical view is an \ninterpretation. What if people view things from a religious, scientific, or \nlogical view?

She was singing a \nsong, and seeing as this was Disney, they would go against the logic of \ntheir film to make a cool song scene. Remember \"Be Prepared\" and all those \nrock formations and sudden hyena spawns? The reason why she didn't want to \ngo back and try was because SHE WAS THE ONE WHO STARTED IT. And she still \nwasn't sure how her powers work. She didn't want to risk hurting Anna again \nor making things worse. It's like when you're cooking something, and the \nstove catches fire for no reason (in your eyes). Some people will end up \ngetting a new stove instead of using the old one to not risk another \naccident. And SHE DIDN'T INTENTIONALLY HURT ANNA.

And maybe \nafter building that house (Disney song logic moment), she probably had some \ntime to think about what she did. She might not of came back because she \nthinks the towns folk might attack her. She also comes back around to \ntrying to go to Anna, and after seeing Anna frozen, hugs her in grief. \nAfter the true love moment happened between the 2, the Winter ended. So \nshe's not pure evil. And saying Frozen is a political film is like saying \nThe Lego Movie is a propaganda film. Say that in public, and no one would \nlisten to you thinking you're crazy or overthinking it. And how is my claim \nasserting? I talk about how the press would react if all these \nPhilosophical BS messages were true. The media would be all over these \nanimation studios, TONS of people would lose their jobs, and the american \nanimation industry would be dead.

Are you also implying that the rest of us common folk \ncan't think right because of no Philosophy? Even the guys who study at \nuniversities? Jeez, you guys are pretty one-minded on that Philosophy \nstuff. Wouldn't want to be with a bunch of guys like that. What I meant by \nthe  \"Maybe if you tell your child that movies are fake and are intended to \nentertain (except messages), then maybe he/she will be fine then\" line was \nthat ignoring the messages, everything else about a movie is still meant to \nentertain.  Entertainment comes 1st, then messages come next. I also wasn't \nsaying the messages don't exist \"yah fuckwit\". I was addressing that to \nanyone thinking that there's ONLY a message to these animated films and \nblindly ignoring all the effort that was put into these animated films like \nthe animation, songs, voice acting, etc. \n\nOne final thing, seeing as we're now gonna start hurling insults at each \nother (I tried to avoid that), hope you and Stefan enjoy a happy life \ntogether.

She doesn't ask Anna if she knows where the trolls are.\n\nImagine, Elsa asks Anna to go, but to send someone back who knows where to \nfind the trolls.  She says she thinks there's a book in the Palace library. \n That combines Elsa's two objectives, remove Anna from danger and find out \nmore about how to stop the winter.

No we should just keep loving the \npowerful people WHO ARE KILLING US until they get better.  Great advice.\n\n\"And Frozen isn't a political film.\"\nIt's a film about those with political powers, and how we should respond to \nthem, at least in part.

Elsa as said in the film \nhas no control over her powers. She wanted Anna to leave her alone. That's \nwhere she accidentally Freezes her heart.  And if you can even follow what \nthe plot was, the only time Anna got hurt was when she was a kid, and once \nas an adult. SHE WASN'T GETTING ABUSED BY ELSA THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. I \nalready said how most kids will see Elsa as a princess. And Elsa's powers \nkeep coming back to haunt her. She was locked away for most of her life, \nand she almost (it's Disney) looses Anna from her at the end. Clearly, the \npowers were ruining her life. How would kids take away anything about a \npowerful being from that? They have miserable lives? I'm also talking about \nHans (forgot about him). The way Anna leaves him shows that she doesn't \nneed a man to be happy. She's independent. What I mean by love is how Anna \ntries her hardest to help Elsa despite her powers, and not giving up on \nher.  You seem quite fixed on the abuse idea, and let me tell you THERE WAS \nNO ABUSE BECAUSE ELSA WAS LOCKED AWAY. Anna lived the normal life but \nwanted to be with her sister again. And how do we know what messages are \nreal? Well if they said it in an interview or article, if it seems preachy, \nand whether you like it or not, if it's a happy or realistic message (Up's \ndeath message for example). If all the accused animated films actually had \nevil messages, then the press would be all over them and kids won't be \ntaken to see anymore. That's why most animated films always have a happy \nmessage and ending. It's to keep parents and kids happy. The main reason \nwhy I draw the line there is because LOOK AT ALL THE ANIMATED FILMS WE HAVE \nNOW. Nearly all of them DON'T bring up any sort of religious, political \n(outside environmental), Philosophical, or any other message like that \nbecause that would cause controversy and parents might not see the films \nbecause of these alleged messages. Most of them go for the happy or gritty \nrealism messages, and that's what makes them family films. It's also seen \nthat Frozen and Rio 2 haven't even caused an uproar with parents, press, or \neven kids. Maybe these alleged messages weren't obvious enough for them to \nunderstand, or no one even saw them, or they're just BS?.  And Frozen isn't \na political film. If we go by the rulers, Elsa accidentally froze the city, \nAnna was trying to fix it, and Elsa ran away to AVOID hurting anyone. Do \nyou seem to just obey Stefan or what? I disagree with his claims, and you \ntry to convince me otherwise. I bring up a logical argument on how there's \nno way animation studios are that evil nowadays otherwise, they'd be fired. \nAnd you seem to be ignoring the abuse thing the entire time. If you really \nare a parent, and you're believing everything Stefan is saying, then I \nguess you're ok with Stefan telling you how to raise your child then? And \nyour probably gonna try to teach your kid Philosophy then? If that's true, \nthen that's your child then, and you have full control. But I guess that \nStefan has a big say in what films your child should watch then huh?

Anna wanted to help her because they're family, and she needs the city \nfixed. Also, Elsa locked herself in her room for those 10 years, it wasn't \nlike she was hurting Anna her whole life. Or that she enjoyed it.\n\nKristoff and Anna may have kissed, but they didn't marry. or talk of kids. \nThat was more of a thank you for everything kiss. \n\nObviously, I know Thomas, and other shows have important messages. I'm \ntalking about stupid stuff like \"Thomas the tank engine encourages \ncapitalism\" or any other BS claim. I'm saying don't bring Philosophy into \nthose kind of shows, and let the kids learn the basic face value messages.\n\nAgain, I'm talking about Philosophy messages, so HTTYD is fine since it's \nan obvious message. Where I draw the line is when people try to bring up \nphilosophy, religion, liberal, political (some cases), or any other types \nof messages like those since they feel so preposterous and out of place in \na kids film. Most kids don't know how politics work, or even what the word \nreally means. So keep those kinds of messages out of these animated films \nand let the parents talk to the kids about that particular medium.\n\n  "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvzEitihku7kqoPcF4kKkyg", "inappropriate_score": 0.19317450096587249, "authorDisplayName": "Michael Price", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xs3vprpv2zjre123bcrobqxfecboux", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-22T11:39:17.249Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvzEitihku7kqoPcF4kKkyg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.41428599999999999, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-07-22T11:39:17.249Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110052846499317783376", "textDisplay": "+JCstealth2344 \"I still don't think Disney is that f-ed up to have their \ncharacters be that evil.\"\nOk, then explain how the characters of Elsa and Anna are NOT evil.  Let's \nstart with Elsa.  She has a superpower.  She is told that she needs to \nlearn to control it.  She does not.  Admittedly she gets no help to do \nthis, and initially she's just a child.  Then she grows to adulthood, \nchronologically if not emotionally.  She continues with the same approach \nto controlling her power that has been failing for years, repression.  When \nthat fails spectacularly she tries another approach, running away.  Which \nis really a variation of her first approach.  \n\nSo far she's just a mess, not actually evil.  She's mostly hurt herself, \nand the harm she does her sister she believes is necessary.  But then it \ngoes further.  When she's told about the disastrous effects of her \nabilities she does NOTHING to stop them.  She simply decides there's \nnothing she can do.  While I can understand the approach of breaking free \nof invalid restrictions.  But she wants to break free of every restriction, \nincluding the one about not hurting people.  She literally never does \nanything that helps anyone, after the first incident where she hurts Anna.. \n She is constantly hurting people, and she's never called on it.  This is a \nmessage you can't fail to get.  It's not \"hidden\", it's the obvious \nmessage.  The powerful, beautiful person gets to get away with shit.  \n\n\"Even if Stefan has argued it, it doesn't mean it's true. I'm still certain \na lot of filmmakers don't include a whole lot of Philosophy into their \nfilms intentionally. \"\nIt doesn't matter if they do it \"intentionally\" but I'm sure they do, if \nonly by default.  They are PROFESSIONALS.  If they wanted to make a movie \nabout magic princesses that didn't tell people \"Just keep loving your \ndestructive and self-involved relative until they get better no matter how \nmuch they hurt you\" they could.  The decided to write the movie so that \nthat message is in \"Frozen\".  \n\n\" This is why there have been what I like to call \"coincidences\", where \nboth medians collide by accident.  \"\nOk, where is your evidence that these messages were, or even could be, sent \nby \"coincidence\"?  The characters did what they did because the writers \ntold them to.  The writers therefore decided everything they did. Yes they \nwanted drama, comedy etc. but there are THOUSANDS of ways to do that.  They \nchose the way that sent these OBVIOUS messages.  And yes they're obvious, \nto anyone who thinks about them, not \"hidden\" to any major extent.\n\n\"I also stand by my statement of taking some things for face value, \nespecially for kid focused shows or films.\"\nAnd what is \"face value\"?  At face value this film is about a pair of \nirresponsible, self-involved bitches and how good it is that they be saved \nbecause they deserve to be rulers, even though they do nothing virtuous the \nentire movie.  The supposed message of \"love\" is that love involves doing \nthings for the good of someone who hurts you continually for 10 YEARS. \n Really that is the \"face value\" of this film, is it any better than the \n\"hidden\" meanings?\n\n\"I never thought Kristoff was the love interest for Anna\"\nReally?  So the fact that they kiss at the end isn't a hint?  She's \nspecifically told that he loves her, and she seeks him out for a kiss.  \n\n\"Otherwise, Philosophy guys will start attacking Thomas the Tank Engine, \nDora the Explorer, and plenty of other kids shows despite them meaning no \nharm.\"\n\nOk, so do you believe that these shows have no meaning?  Because if they \ndon't then they're a damn waste of time.  Children are supposed to be \nLEARNING things, That's their JOB.\n\n\"He should just ignore animated family films because they almost never try \nto hide any messages too deep, otherwise the kids and parents would have a \nhard time finding them.\"\n\nKids can get the messages, they're not stupid.  If you have a film where \nthe businessmen are all evil, they get that businessmen are supposed to be \nevil.  If you have a film where the hero ignores what the boss says and it \nworks and saves the day (e.g. How To Train Your Dragon ) they get that \ndoing your own thing and ignoring the boss is good (at least sometimes). \n The idea that children, who are the most aware of us all, miss these \nthings is absurd."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEMivaGaCYRcONtEM6_MJA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "JCstealth2344", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xs3vprpv2zjre123bcrobqxfecboux", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-22T10:44:54.908Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJEMivaGaCYRcONtEM6_MJA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.45610599999999996, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-07-22T10:44:54.908Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Kag37R85Xoc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABQ/PfRMjlBh148/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117097925729442165803", "textDisplay": "+Michael Price \"They're professionals, they had total control of the \nscript, it is what they wanted it to be\". \n\nI still don't think Disney is that f-ed up to have their characters be that \nevil.

These \nprofessionals do these aimed more for general audiences and critics. Not \nreally to philosophers since they aren't the main focus. If there's an \naction film being made, and the villain does something horrid, it's \nprobably to build up his character or to create some tension with the \ncharacter rather than something philosophical. This is why there have been \nwhat I like to call \"coincidences\", where both medians collide by accident. \n \n\nI also stand by my statement of taking some things for face value, \nespecially for kid focused shows or films. Should we dissect Thomas the \nTank Engine just because there would be some possible hidden messages in \nthere? Or what if I made an innocent kids film about the importance of \nfamily? I wouldn't want to put anything too deep to the point where the \nkids AND adults can't see them.  \n\nI never thought Kristoff was the love interest for Anna since the ENTIRE \nfilm is about breaking that cliche where it's more about the sisters \nrelationship rather than a romance one. So some of that argument I disagree \nwith.\n\nAgain, for the target audience of these films( toddler to elementary school \nstudent), I doubt 90% of them or more can see the \"Philosophical\" messages \nthe film has. They're just gonna see the obvious ones like Frozen's message \nabout being independent, Rio 2's environmental message, Lego Movie's \nbelieve in yourself message, or HTTYD2's darker message about death and \novercoming what life throws at you. These messages kids and adults can see. \nPhilosophical ones, I doubt majority will see them. Some might call them \nBS.

Nope. Some things \nare meant to be taken for face value. \"\n\nHere's what I said:  \" Everything has hidden meanings, for a sufficiently \nbroad definition of \"hidden\". \".  In other words I don't think the meanings \nwere that hidden.  When you show a character doing something, and a \nreaction to that, you're showing that reaction is appropriate.  \n\nSo for instance Anna \"rewards\" Kristoff for *saving her life* by replacing \nhis sled (which was only lost due to her sister's vapid negligence).  This \nis treated as though it were a generous thing to do instead of the very \nleast she could do and still be considered human.  That sends a message \nthat rich powerful people should be served without expectation of reward \nand if they even reimburse you for your costs you should be happy, whether \nthe authors \"meant\" it or not.  To me the message isn't that hidden.  \n\nNow imagine that Anna had done this and Kristoff had said, \"Great, that's \nwhat you should do when someone loses property in your service.  Now if you \nthink that's actually rewarding someone, you my dear are an ungrateful, \ndelusional bitch.  Seriously I risk my life for you and you give me \nsomething that's worth less than your DRESS?   And that I only need because \nI lost the last one doing what you needed doing?  Tell you what, I'll take \nmy reward now, it's NEVER SEEING YOU AGAIN YOU UNGRATEFUL BRAT!\"\n\nDifferent message right?  And a far more healthy one.  But it undermines \nthe massively irrational romance between Anna and Kristoff.  No Kristoff \nmust be \"in love\" with Anna, despite the fact that she has been \nhorrifically self-involved.   Now they could have fixed this easily.  They \ncould have had Anna suggest that Kristoff be knighted and given a highly \npaid job for his service.  This is entirely in line with fairy tales,  Hell \nconsidering how little the sisters know about the common folk he would \nactually be helpful  They'll need to do something about the ice industry \nfor a start and he knows about it.\n\n\" He should just ignore animated family films because they almost never try \nto hide any messages too deep, otherwise the kids and parents would have a \nhard time finding them.\"\n\nThese messages are being sent, and sent to children.
