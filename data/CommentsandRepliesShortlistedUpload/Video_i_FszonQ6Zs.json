Not taking into consideration how damaging this is to \nbasic (natural) psychological development is absurd. *Absurd* if after a \nchildhood like that you expect the results to be independent, responsible, \nsuccessful citizens.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z135ybyi2uvqu53ky23uevtykwueclrd4": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRXSTvPGXIBHiZfEuhQ_AOw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jkMYC0HbHkk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAUc/CJ8XL0rJXVs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.5384615384615385, "authorDisplayName": "Mel le", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-23T21:43:26.595Z", "videoId": "i_FszonQ6Zs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRXSTvPGXIBHiZfEuhQ_AOw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.90142010000000006, "formal_score": 80, "updatedAt": "2014-07-23T21:43:26.595Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101204649594787929210", "textDisplay": "Anyone notice how he bitches about 'conservative' being used as a \npejorative term with prejudice associated with it, RIGHT after that he \ngeneralizes \"the left\" in a pejorative manner.\n\nWhat a dishonest fuckhead...\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12aflgyuxfrzrcbk04cfzdx1qm3cndqkhg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgLRr_6iNs2Wk0fzqpEuzog", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Quercuspalustris50", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-24T03:45:45.815Z", "videoId": "i_FszonQ6Zs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgLRr_6iNs2Wk0fzqpEuzog"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46351199999999998, "formal_score": 95, "updatedAt": "2014-07-24T03:45:45.815Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106670693481489178224", "textDisplay": "Education is not that elastic:  some people will pay 10k for a degree, but \nnear as many will pay 100k for the same degree if that degree leads to a \nhigh paying job.

He usually says (or \nsaid) as much himself, and now he's older, and, for me at least, he's lost \nthe funny edge as well as he's just inching out into deeper waters every \nyear. I listened to his \"pirate ship\" broadcasts for a while, but I haven't \nheard a Carolla podcast in a year or two now. So he's spiraling downwards.\n\nAnyway despite that, the man genuinely worked his ass off in his early \nyears. And like me, came from poverty, might even call it severe poverty. \nThat much explains why he views people the way he does, but the thing is, \nand I used to hear him say this, I doubt if he ever really believed it, he \ngot lucky. He was teaching Kimmel boxing lessons and Kimmel thought he was \nhilarious so that opened up all kinds of doors for him. In the comedy \nbusiness, an industry I've spent some time in, there's so much luck that \nplaying odds on who will make it is always a long shot. And quite \nliterally, it makes no logical sense. Guys that are genuinely funny don't \nmake it, where other guys that are really funny flounder for years and \nyears and then are almost famous overnight and they're killing it, Ari \nShaffir comes to mind as a great example. \n\nSo while I respect what Carolla's done he really doesn't have the \ncapability to understand the bigger picture. He's not studied enough and \nhe's certainly not wise enough. He's got a lot to learn, like, you \npersonally don't get to choose what words mean what in popular lexicon. \nConservatives are seen as shit heads because they act like shit heads. You \nknow, all those family value guys running around banging mistresses.

That's ridiculous and demonstrably false, I'm sure it's \non the wikipedia you're supposedly pulling from.\n\nLet me clear this up for you, Carolla doesn't support mainstream \nRepublicans or Conservatives, which is part of the reason why he doesn't \nlike how the word is used against them. Well too bad for him, that's what \nthe word associates with nowadays. I'm with you on that. He really doesn't \nsuck up to the rich, he doesn't really like most people. But he is greedy, \nanyone can hear that. I get it, I don't support it but I'm not going to \nmisrepresent him like you are doing and what other people are doing. But \njust don't take my word for it, I'm sure you could google it when you get \nhome and find the subsequent podcast rants about politics. You have no \nexcuse man, the information is out there, I've told you, others have told \nyou, if you just stick your head in the sand you're not better than the \npeople who you rail against.\n\nI frankly don't want you, or people like you, in this movement, you only \nharm it. We need reasonable, rational and emotionally stable folks calling \nfor reform based on solid evidence, reasoning and understanding.\n\nOh and comparing Carolla to Kardashian, man you're just a fucking dumby, \njust admit you don't like him and leave it at that.

No \ndude, during one of his odd jobs, coaching a wannabe boxer, he got lucky \nand met someone who took a shine to him.  Calling him a hard worker because \nhe became famous is like calling kim kardashian a hard worker.  Carolla IS \nwrong.  And the reason for that is this.  He is supporting a group of men \nand women who purposely lie and cheat to keep the majority of people \nsubservient because it keeps their bosses rich.  Carolla uses the money he \nEASILY obtained, from us \"lower class people\" and then mocks us.  He should \n\"work hard\" to help the situation by trying to get certain laws and \npolicies reversed, so that hard working people can actually stand a chance \non this planet.  There are MILLIONS of people in China who work 18 hour \ndays and earn pennies.

Don't \nextrapolate, don't interpret, just read and respond. I mean otherwise, \nyou're inventing fairy tale arguments.\n\nHe's actually an ideal person to say 'focus on hard work' because he \nascended to the point where he's at in life because he worked hard to get \nthere.

For example, I can't think of \nanyone, and I challenge you to come up with one, who didn't get lucky at \nsome point at all. Carolla's a guy who at the time was a fucking carpenter, \nwhat did he know about putting a tv show together? What did he know about \nradio? How could he prove any of it? Who would even give him a shot? \nHonestly, try any of that yourself, what industry are you in? I'll pick a \nposition for you that's several years removed from your experience and ask \nyou to apply for those positions. You tell me if you think network \nexecutives, managers would give you the time of day or ignore you. How do \nyou think the entertainment industry works?\n\nAnyway, you're pulling implications that aren't really there. You're \nmisrepresenting what he's on about, I know because I've heard his diatribe \nfor years before I stopped listening regularly. It hasn't changed much, \nbecome more extreme yes, same shit though. When he says get to work, he's \njust talking about people who he perceives as whining and looking for a \nhandout. From what he's said, he has good examples throughout his life of \npeople who operate like this. His childhood friends went nowhere in life, \nhe talked about this stuff on air so I'm sure it can be got easily if \nyou're interested.\n\nSo while I understand where he's coming from, Ana's right, he's living in a \nbubble. At the end of the day he just doesn't know what he's on about, and \nlike any regular joe he makes absolute statements, I know he doesn't mean \nit because if you listen to him enough he clears it up.

A person who follows the philosophies of \nconservatism is referred to as a traditionalist or conservative. Some \nconservatives seek to preserve things as they are, emphasizing stability \nand continuity, while others, called reactionaries, oppose modernism and \nseek a return to \"the way things were\".[1][2] The first established use of \nthe term in a political context originated with Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de \nChateaubriand in 1818,[3] during the period of Bourbon restoration that \nsought to roll back the policies of the French Revolution. The term, \nhistorically associated with right-wing politics, has since been used to \ndescribe a wide range of views. There is no single set of policies that are \nuniversally regarded as conservative, because the meaning of conservatism \ndepends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus \nconservatives from different parts of the world\u2014each upholding their \nrespective traditions\u2014may disagree on a wide range of issues. Edmund Burke, \nan 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution but supported \nthe American Revolution, is credited as one of the main theorists of \nconservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s.[4] According to Quintin Hogg, \nthe chairman of the British Conservative Party in 1959, \"Conservatism is \nnot so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a \ntimeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding \nto a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself.\"\n\n*Socialism* is a social and economic system characterised by social \nownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the \neconomy,[1][2] as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the \nestablishment of such a system.[3][4] \"Social ownership\" may refer to \ncooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen \nownership of equity, or any combination of these.[5] There are many \nvarieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all \nof them.[6] They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the \ndegree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be \norganised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in \nconstructing socialism.[7]\n\nA socialist economic system is based on the organisational precept of \nproduction for use, meaning the production of goods and services to \ndirectly satisfy economic demand and human needs where objects are valued \nbased on their use-value or utility, as opposed to being structured upon \nthe accumulation of capital and production for profit.[8] In the \ntraditional conception of a socialist economy, coordination, accounting and \nvaluation would be performed in kind (using physical quantities), by a \ncommon physical magnitude, or by a direct measure of labour-time in place \nof financial calculation.[9][10] On distribution of output there have been \ntwo proposals, one which is based on the principle of to each according to \nhis contribution and another on the principle of from each according to his \nability, to each according to his need. The advisability, feasibility and \nexact methods of resource allocation and valuation are the subject of the \nsocialist calculation debate.\n\nThe socialist political movement includes a diverse array of political \nphilosophies. Core dichotomies within the socialist movement include the \ndistinction between reformism and revolutionary socialism and between state \nsocialism and libertarian socialism. State socialism calls for the \nnationalisation of the means of production as a strategy for implementing \nsocialism, while libertarian socialists generally place their hopes in \ndecentralized means of direct democracy such as libertarian municipalism, \ncitizens' assemblies, trade unions, and workers' councils[11] coming from a \ngeneral anti-authoritarian stance.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18] Democratic \nsocialism highlights the central role of democratic processes and political \nsystems and is usually contrasted with non-democratic political movements \nthat advocate socialism.[19] Some socialists have adopted the causes of \nother social movements, such as environmentalism, feminism and \nliberalism.[20]\n\nModern socialism originated from an 18th-century intellectual and working \nclass political movement that criticised the effects of industrialisation \nand private property on society. The revival of republicanism in the \nAmerican Revolution of 1776 and the egalitarian values introduced by the \nFrench Revolution of 1789 gave rise to socialism as a distinct political \nmovement. In the early 19th century, \"socialism\" referred to any concern \nfor the social problems of capitalism irrespective of the solutions to \nthose problems. However, by the late 19th century, \"socialism\" had come to \nsignify opposition to capitalism and advocacy for an alternative \npost-capitalist system based on some form of social ownership.[21] During \nthis time, German philosopher Karl Marx and his collaborator Friedrich \nEngels published works criticizing the utopian aspects of contemporary \nsocialist trends and applied a materialist understanding of socialism as a \nphase of development which will come about through social revolution \ninstigated by escalating and conflicting class relationships within \ncapitalism.[22] Alongside this there appeared other tendencies such as \nanarchism, revolutionary syndicalism, social-democracy, Marxism\u2013Leninism \nand democratic socialism as well as the confluence of socialism with \nanti-imperialist and anti-racist struggles around the world. The socialist \nmovement came to be the most influential worldwide movement and \npolitical-economic worldview of the 20th century.[23] Today, socialist \nparties and ideas remain a political force with varying degrees of power \nand influence in all continents leading national governments in many \ncountries\n\n\n*Nationalism* is a belief, creed or political ideology that involves an \nindividual identifying with, or becoming attached to, one's nation. \nNationalism involves national identity, by contrast with the related \nconstruct of patriotism, which involves the social conditioning and \npersonal behaviors that support a state's decisions and actions.[1]\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, nationalism (national attachment) is \ndistinct from other types of attachment, for example, attachment to a \nreligion or a romantic partner. The desire for interpersonal attachment, or \nthe need to belong, is one of the most fundamental human motivations.\n\nFrom a political or sociological perspective, there are two main \nperspectives on the origins and basis of nationalism. One is the \nprimordialist perspective that describes nationalism as a reflection of the \nancient and perceived evolutionary tendency of humans to organize into \ndistinct groupings based on an affinity of birth. The other is the \nmodernist perspective that describes nationalism as a recent phenomenon \nthat requires the structural conditions of modern society in order to \nexist.[2]\n\nAn alternative perspective to both of these lineages comes out of Engaged \ntheory, and argues that while the form of nationalism is modern, the \ncontent and subjective reach of nationalism depends upon 'primordial' \nsentiments.[3]\n\nThere are various definitions for what constitutes a nation, however, which \nleads to several different strands of nationalism. It can be a belief that \ncitizenship in a state should be limited to one ethnic, cultural, \nreligious, or identity group, or that multinationality in a single state \nshould necessarily comprise the right to express and exercise national \nidentity even by minorities.[4] The adoption of national identity in terms \nof historical development has commonly been the result of a response by \ninfluential groups unsatisfied with traditional identities due to \ninconsistency between their defined social order and the experience of that \nsocial order by its members, resulting in a situation of anomie that \nnationalists seek to resolve.[5] This anomie results in a society or \nsocieties reinterpreting identity, retaining elements that are deemed \nacceptable and removing elements deemed unacceptable, in order to create a \nunified community.[5] This development may be the result of internal \nstructural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or \ngroups towards other communities, especially foreign powers that are or are \ndeemed to be controlling them.[5]\n\nNational flags, national anthems and other symbols of national identity are \ncommonly considered highly important symbols of the national \ncommunity.[6][7][8][9]\n\n*Republicanism* is the ideology of governing a society or state as a \nrepublic (la. res publica), where the head of state is a representative of \nthe people who hold popular sovereignty rather than the people being \nsubjects of the head of state. The head of state is typically appointed by \nmeans other than heredity, often through elections.\n\nThe exact meaning of republicanism varies depending on the cultural and \nhistorical context. In general it implies the absence of monarchy, but it \nmay indicate anything from 'rule by many people and by law', through \noligarchy, to arbitrary rule by one person.

Where's my free \nmoney? I know many people who have many children with no jobs. .. hair & \nnails done , $100+ sneakers. Your team at tyt are jokers...you and that \nbuffalo cenk.

Feed your kids.  Make breakfast \nfor your kids before they go off and pack a lunch for them.  Show that you \nhave personal accountability.\n\nThis is not about being for or against anything.  It's about who is \nresponsible for doing what.\n\nI'm not responsible for feeding your kids, you are.  If you are unable to \nfeed your kids, then that's almost always your own fault.\n\n*Student loan interest rates?*\n\nOh, right, let's not focus on the fact that most student loans don't get \npaid back.  These so-called \"guaranteed\" loans go unpaid.  Almost half of \nthe people who apply for student loans don't finish college.  That money \ngets thrown down the drain.\n\nSo, you want peole like Adam Coralla to take an even BIGGER cut by cutting \nthe interest rate to 0.75%?  Do you think that's seriously going to \nincrease the rate that the loans are getting paid?  No.\n\n*Banks get 0.75% interest?*\n\nOh gee, wonder why that is?  Because banks actually PAY their loans back! \n A local bank takes out a loan, they can be largely be counted on to make \npayments on time and pay it off as per the agreement.  \n\nYou are rewarded low interest rates by DEMONSTRATING that you are reliable. \n When you make on-time payments, you're rewarded with a higher credit \nrating and thus lower interest rates and people want to finance you.\n\nLiberals, once again, don't want to rely on tried-and-true standards of \ncredit.  Instead, they want to give stuff away for free that other people \nhave to work a lifetime to get.\n\n*Privatizing education?*\n\nIs that being against education? How is the privatization of education \nbeing against education?\n\nThis is a debate on who is responsible for providing education.  This is \nNOT a debate on the importance of education.  \n\nHave a debate on the issues of the debate and stop being a  fucking slob \nand misrepresenting the positions of people.\n\nThe voucher program additionally does NOT prevent poor people from being \neducated.  Ana clearly doesn't know what a voucher is.  A voucher simply \nshifts more responsibility to the parent.\n\nWe can have a debate on whether public or private education is better. \n There are certainly arguments for both sides, but what we can't do is sit \nthere and get mad at people who disagree with us.  \n\nAnd again, if you want to send your kids to a good school, WORK FOR IT. \n Stop asking for free stuff.\n\n*Is privatizing education better?*\n\nI don't think we can even answer the question of this debate, but we can \nsay this:\n\nIncreasing public education funding has not produced better results.  Ever \nsince Richard Nixon founded the Department of Education, it has been \nnothing but trouble.  We have went from the top of the developed world to \naverage at best.  The United States spends more money on education, both in \ntotal and per student, than any other country on Earth.\n\nWe have nothing to show for this excess.  \n\nSo, why not try the voucher program?\n\n*Women and abortion?*\n\nHer point on this is laughably overreaching.\n\nAbortion is about not permitting anybody to murder.  Murder is illegal \nwhether it is committed by a man or a woman.\n\n*Legitimate rape?*\n\nThis is a statement by a single Republican.  I agree that the discussion of \nwhether rape victims are more or less likely to become pregnant isn't very \nmeaningful to the actual debate, but again, this isn't an anti-woman issue. \n This is an issue of murdering unborn children.\n\n*Republicans pushed for food stamp cuts?*\n\nThese cuts were agreed on by BOTH parties.  This was a compromise proposed \nby DEMOCRATS.  Republicans agreed, sure, but Republicans definitely weren't \nthe ones pushing it.  \n\n*Republicans going after certain groups of people?*\n\nOf course, a baseless assertion that nobody has to defend against.  She \nsays this, but offers no evidence\n\n*How do you ensure that you won't have kids?*\n\nDon't have sex.\n\nSex is not listed in the Bill of Rights for a good reason.  If you want to \nassure that you don't have kids, then don't have sex.\n\nBut, ok, if you want to be reasonably sure with sex, then get some birth \ncontrol.\n\n*But, Justus, how do you get birth control if the government doesn't \nprovide it?*\n\nWORK FOR IT!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z124u3ogztjhu5zsa22itnlgbwvwe3cdm": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg__crCLB0nd_ew0gdXRpoA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 2.0408163265306123, "authorDisplayName": "william smith", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-23T16:26:21.824Z", "videoId": "i_FszonQ6Zs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCg__crCLB0nd_ew0gdXRpoA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.90105179999999996, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-07-23T16:26:21.824Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110222892223110700926", "textDisplay": "They only focus on college interest rates when college inflation is over \n5.5% a year but they won't say shit about the colleges\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13dundhssa0zdr3f221wfjaboutyz30o": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYaYIRqeftcKyGrg2Z83U6A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gZglh7tE_P8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/SWR9RHcsAvo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "D347h54rg3n7", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-23T01:59:43.879Z", "videoId": "i_FszonQ6Zs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYaYIRqeftcKyGrg2Z83U6A"}, "sentiment_score": 0.6300619999999999, "formal_score": 98, "updatedAt": "2014-07-23T01:59:43.879Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102564110563556095923", "textDisplay": "I love how hard work and motivation are conservative only principles to so \nmany people. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13uhzx5xxahgpehv04cedfahwybxrh4vfk": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8cjqYnGRP52EUzshfuYOOg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IL1W37nNr74/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGw/2Le8W9fnpsU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "WillMePHD", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-23T09:42:19.857Z", "videoId": "i_FszonQ6Zs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8cjqYnGRP52EUzshfuYOOg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.23416799999999999, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-07-23T09:42:19.857Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117195397530856108584", "textDisplay": "im tired of liberal media. and your sounding way too liberal right now. \nother videos you've done good on, but some, like this one, you are not \ndoing so good.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13usxazkubnslriu04celdx5v2kxh5hiro0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCznsKUC-eU9bsObjrhiDA2A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.0600706713780919, "authorDisplayName": "BBRYANT03", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-23T02:49:29.171Z", "videoId": "i_FszonQ6Zs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCznsKUC-eU9bsObjrhiDA2A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.42605599999999999, "formal_score": 21, "updatedAt": "2014-07-23T02:50:16.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105464826320834735632", "textDisplay": "Does no one else think both sides are thick skulled self important ignorant \nsacks of shit that refuse to compromise on any sort of issue and thats why \nour congress has been gridlocked for years?

As often mentioned on TYT, polls \nabout self-identified ideologies tend to favor the \"conservative\" label \nover the \"liberal\" label, but when polled on individual issues, Americans \ntend to favor liberal and progressive positions.  Might this suggest that, \nat least, self-identified ideological labels are inaccurate? \n\nTraditional media and the political system have spent *decades* trying to \nbrand and rebrand labels that people self-identify with, or have instead \nrebranded competing labels through demonization, often for far more \nfrivolous goals such as the all-important choice of carbonated beverage.  \nShouldn't it be clear by now that the labels \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" \nhave been rebranded to, in part, divide the working-class by pitting each \nagainst one another?

They believe in \nonly themselves like social Darwinism where if someone fails than it is \nconsidered week.

Being liberal began to be a bad \nthing, associated with too much government and too high taxes and giving \nminorities a fair shake. And that's where we are now.\n\nLittle Adam is whining about the pendulum swinging back (although I don't \nsee much evidence of that; it seems more like conservatives whining when \nthey don't get their own way all of the time and/or are called out on their \nbigotry and hypocrisy). \n\nI think little Adam needs to *really* grow up and get used to the fact that \nAmerica isn't entirely on his side. It's always funny to me when the \ntough-guy rugged individualists whine about getting their fee-fees hurt. \nPussies.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKsxsKLWRTmZIgkwffFPHcw", "inappropriate_score": 1.639344262295082, "authorDisplayName": "Tom McDonald", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12mfhljxmyndhu3r23gwtrhcmjlsb2tl", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-11T12:52:12.288Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKsxsKLWRTmZIgkwffFPHcw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.76625399999999999, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-11T12:52:12.288Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-B9R9BXHwP3Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAUg/GI1dSYBGows/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113541528270986083053", "textDisplay": "+catbuffalo The thing about it is that this lib(tard?) could do that.

Other people who \nare not employed are unemployed because they are between jobs or there are \nnot enough jobs or they can't find a job. Then there are other people who \ndo not work because they have some sort of issue either a physical \ndisability or mental health issues which are very broad,nuanced and \ncomplex. He just makes the assumption that everyone who is not employed is \nlazy . I do not believe anyone who is not employed is simply lazy, I think \nanyone who is not employed has some legitimate reason why they are not \nemployed this minute.\nWhat needs to be addressed is the quality of life for low income people \nwhich is insufficient for fostering an environment that helps people \nachieve higher potentials, experience less strain and unhappiness and which \ncreates more problems for society. People need enough abundance to meet \ncertain needs like good food--as opposed to food bank processed junk food \nand dollar store bargain junk food which is what lower income can only \nafford. Also the strain of living in small apartments, and being \nstigmatized and ranked low economic, the crime.I can't even articulate how \nbad it is to be lower income/poor/destitute and how much it bothers me that \nhigher income people dismiss the,ignore,trivialize all the problems \nassociated with it. They simply reduce it to a matter of will power, and \nlaziness and they overlook all the problems,suffering associated with it. \nIt is scary to me when I think of how bad it is to be poor. It makes me \nfeel intense dread and angers me that anyone can walk into a fast food \nrestaurant and not care about the people in such austere circumstances and \nit angers me that people are satisfied to see others work so hard for so \nlittle. I also think that the whole \"hard work\" thing is completely \nridiculous. Hard work is not something anyone should have forced on them if \nso they are a slave. People work at things they like and are good at and \nwhich they feel pride in and that help society,like a fireman works hard \nwhen there is a fire and sees the reward when he/she saves someone from a \nfire, and he is happy and has pride and society is better off from it. Then \nhe goes to the fire station and plays some cards etc...I know there is more \nwork than that but I think you can understand. But to burden others with \nhard labor arbitrarily doing meaningless,repetitive,low wage in toxic \nenvironment just so you can say that they are working is wrong. Those \npeople might be better off not working or getting a basic income and doing \nlight but meaningful work like 10 hours a week at a stray cat sanctuary , \nor 10 hours a week cleaning up some litter, or serving meals in a hospital. \nThat way they are not overworked,over strained, they are doing something \nmeaningful and beneficial (as opposed to slaving in a fast food restaurant, \n60 hours a week serving cheap junk food at low wage to make the CEO's lots \nof profits.) We should redistribute money through progressive taxes, lower \nlabor hours, like have 3-4 day work week w/ six hour days, create \nflexible,tailorable social programs, have a basic income program,build \nquality, green, environmentally friendly homes for anyone who needs them \nand have free healthcare and education. Also have appliance,tool, and \ninstrument libraries available for people to use. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z135x3uxukj4tj3ra04cdbmjcmistjtqru00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoY1VDHTLmei8bkClcvQH5w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-v4-rUmFIFok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFg/lMGK5DXqDyM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.7316017316017316, "authorDisplayName": "BarlowEnter", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-23T05:06:36.436Z", "videoId": "i_FszonQ6Zs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoY1VDHTLmei8bkClcvQH5w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.88180199999999997, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-07-23T05:15:43.000Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116726684555280780617", "textDisplay": "Why is there fucking 70 dislikes?

I have fond memories of listening to Adam and \nDrew on Loveline in the old days. I thought Adam was a comedic genius (and \nmaybe, deep down, he still is). He used to have a lot of sympathy for the \npoor. True, he'd go on conservative rants as well, but they were mostly \nsilly, and I assumed they were pretty much just for comedic effect. \n\nThen more recently I read his book \"In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks.\" Of \ncourse he repeated all his old stories--even in the old days he was \nconstantly repeating his stories, like a senile relative. In particular he \nrepeats his goofy conservative stories, except that now he makes clear that \nthey weren't comedy, but his real beliefs. I was especially bothered by a \nsection in which he said he was going to complain about what was wrong with \nboth liberals and conservatives. He started with the liberals, and made the \nusual boring remarks. But when it was the conservatives' time, he just \ncomplained about how they weren't libertarian enough for him. Jeez.\n\nAnd he'd rant without knowing what he was talking about. For example, he \ndidn't like it when people complained about high drug prices. He said he \n*wanted* drug companies to make a shit ton of money, because that meant \nthey'd use the money to research even more great drugs. He was totally \nunaware of drug companies and how they work: They focus on me-too drugs \nthat offer little or no improvements over existing ones, focus on gaming \nthe patent system and manipulating and bribing doctors for maximum profit, \nshockingly rarely come up with truly new drugs, and yes, way overcharge. \nNot only that, most drugs that they release are the result of buying up the \nsmall companies that invented them, or reaping the benefits of GOVERNMENT \nfinanced university research. Drug companies these days are little more \nthan drug *testing* companies, for the purpose of getting FDA approval. If \ngiven more money, the very *last* thing they're going to is plow it back \ninto research. But then Adam was always honest about how he didn't like to \nread or learn.\n\nI really shouldn't say/think this, but I half wish that Adam had died some \ntime ago, so I wouldn't have to see what he's become.\n\nAs for Drew, who I guess is on Adam's bandwagon now, well, it was always \nclear that he was really into money. But it seems like he'll swim in any \ncesspool if there's a penny in it for him. Last time I saw him was on his \nfluffy, pointless cable channel. It was clear that he'd gotten a *lot* of \ntraining in how to be a host of that kind of show. His voice and mannerisms \nwere so transformed that it seemed like someone had stuck a chip in his \nhead.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ev1qgiv2khlxfj22pjrfbutjzwnwfy": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOYAkRJ0BxQEIaAqGlbKfTA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Anonymous", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-23T11:23:01.285Z", "videoId": "i_FszonQ6Zs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOYAkRJ0BxQEIaAqGlbKfTA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.60948599999999997, "formal_score": 71, "updatedAt": "2014-07-23T11:23:01.285Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102372942852464988773", "textDisplay": "If anyone made \"conservative\" a dirty word, it's the Republicans.

If \nthey weren't so out of touch, backward, and being dragged kicking a \nscreaming into the 21st century and reality, the word \"conservative\" \nwouldn't have the tinge associated with it. Conservatives have, through \ntheir own actions, beliefs, and public statements maligned their own \nmovement. But, ironically, the party of \"personal responsibility\" doesn't \ntake ANY responsibility for any backlash against their closed minded views. \nIt's always \"those damned libruls!\" who have maligned them, have been \nmeanies, who call names. It's NEVER their fault when they're called out for \nbelieving things that most in modern society have wisely eschewed, because \nthey're 20, 30, 50 year old views and nostalgic \"good ol' days\" mentality \nare perfectly realistic and not at all based in fantasy, it's those \nliberals/academics/atheists/any \nnon-christians/unions/democrats/socialists/anyone with any opinion \ncontrasting their own.

How DARE they bring in facts when a \nwell-placed, misinformed, gut feeling lie is just fine for conservatives. \nHow DARE they not teach unscientific religious dogma in science class. And \nhow DARE they teach sex in sex education class. Because, when it comes down \nto it, the conservative movement is a dinosaur, seeing the comet approach \nthe atmosphere, ignoring it, chastising anyone who tells them it's coming, \nwillfully ignoring the imminent demise that is coming. Instead of face \nfacts, change their views, or at least re-evaluate whether their beliefs \nare based in fact or not, they'd much rather blame anyone but themselves. \nEVERYONE ELSE is wrong, not them. And that is the bubble modern \nconservatives live in. It's why they can constantly, incessantly, in an \nalmost clockwork fashion spew debunked ideas, demonstrably failed economic \ntheories, and outright lies that \"just feel right\" over and over and over \nall the while the true believers, the dyed-in-the-wool conservatives who \nthink Leave it to Beaver was a documentary lap it up and repeat it ad \nnauseum.
