Or if you have the patience you can read through the actual \ntrial transcripts yourself.\n\nI told you EXACTLY WHY Mumia was let off Death Row.  \n\nJudge Yohn caved to public pressure and agreed that the jury sentencing \ninstructions could possibly be confusing to complete morons.  That meant \nthey had to redo the sentencing phase.  If they had gone through it and \nsought the Death Penalty they could have gotten it but it would restart the \nwhole appeals process again.  They would drag on indefinitely and \neventually Mumia would die of old age before he could be executed.  \n\nSince that made the whole endeavor pointless they agreed to Life Without \nParole so they could be done with it and Maureen Faulkner wouldn't have to \ncontinue coming to court proceedings and reliving the worst night of her \nlife for the next few decades..\n\nJudge Yohn shouldn't have caved.  They should have asked the jurors if the \nsentencing instructions confused them.  Assuming Mumia couldn't pay them \noff they would have given a definitive answer and Mumia would be in the \nground where he belongs.\n\nIf the Courts were really as corrupt as Mumia claims they were he would \nhave been executed decades ago.  Technically Mumia was only entitled to one \nPCRA hearing but they bent over backwards and gave him three so there \nwouldn't be any doubts as to the validity of his conviction.  Mumia failed \nevery single time.  The claims he made were proven to be absolute bullshit \nbeyond any shadow of a doubt.

There \nis more than enough evidence in this case.  Mumia was caught at the scene \nless than 70 seconds after firing the first shot.  He had his gun beside \nhim with all 5 bullets spent.  He had a bullet in his chest that came from \nDaniel Faulkner's gun. \n\nYou do realize that at the time of the shooting Mumia's journalism career \nwas dead in the water right?  He had been fired from his radio job because \nhe had lost his journalistic objectivity because of his obsession with \nMOVE. That is why he was having to drive a taxi for a living. He wasn't a \npolitical threat to anyone when he was arrested.  He NEVER won the Peabody \nAward he \"accidentally\" takes credit for.  He's a liar.\n\nIf the police were so corrupt that they would kill one of their own to \nsilence Mumia they would have shot him dead at the scene.  Mumia attempted \nto pull his gun on Officer Shoemaker who was the first cop on the scene \nafter the shooting.  Shoemaker could have blown his head off instead of \nkicking the gun away.  If they were corruptly trying to silence him they \ncould have had him \"accidentally\" killed in prison at any point in the last \n30+ years.  \n\nThe reason the State is intent on keeping Mumia behind bars is because he \nbrutally murdered a policeman in the line of duty.  \n\nHe really should have been executed IMO.  He allows his followers to \ndemonize the victim and the victim's wife to this day.  If he was innocent \nyou would think he would at least pretend to care about bringing the \nalleged phantom shooter to justice.  His brother saw the whole thing and \nsaid \"I didn't have anything to do with it\".  He didn't say \"the shooter \nran away and you can catch him if you go that way\". \n\nThe only reason this case appears to have holes is because Mumia's \nfollowers twist the truth where they can and make up completely bullshit \nlies where they can't."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-InHNL0HwVgvM-Qk0ZHlQQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ibopwebop", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13efl3pskz0e531a23yc5b5svjldf52d", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-02T16:29:31.272Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-InHNL0HwVgvM-Qk0ZHlQQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.31498399999999999, "formal_score": 20, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-02T16:29:31.272Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-O7tMr68jDXU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/DJFdsoNwIEk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105203918804061696507", "textDisplay": "+Jason Reynolds\nI never said that every case needs a re-trial but give me break this whole \ncase has holes then swiss cheese.

As it turns out the National Association of \nBroadcasters, who actually are the ones who hand out the Peabody Awards, \nhave absolutely NO RECORD of ever giving him said award. To put it in \nsimple terms this makes him a liar.\n\nEven thought we know that Mumia has no integrity and is a liar let's give \nhim the benefit of the doubt and try and see what he has done to benefit \nanybody. He has written numerous books and has recorded hundreds, if not \nthousands, of essays on racism, class warfare, revolution, etc. These have \nallowed him to raise millions of dollars for his legal campaign to save \nhimself from the electrocution he had earned for himself and make himself a \ncelebrity among hard core leftists. They have inspired people to hold \ncountless marches and rallies on his behalf.  \n\nWhile that has certainly done wonders for his ego it hasn't changed society \nfor the better. It hasn't done much more than allow him to die in prison of \nold age instead of by execution. He hasn't improved the situation for Black \npeople, Communists, or anyone else for that matter.\n\nSo basically you are equatinging MLK, who actually changed the face of race \nrelations and ended segregation, with a criminal nobody whose sole \naccomplishments are killing a cop and weaseling his way off Death Row.

I guess the inference \nshe's making is \"how do you liken a man who was resolved to a non-violent \napproach to achieve a political end with a man who blew a cop away?\" Well, \nperhaps the leg-chair legend isn't aware of the fact that early on in the \nCivil Rights movement Dr. King actually believed in the use of firearms and \neven carried one (So therein lies the potential for direct juxtaposition \nwith Jamal, cause who knows what Dr. King might've done at that point if he \ncame under the duress of abusive \"law enforcement\" agents?) It wasn't until \nlater on in the movement that he was swayed by others in his circle to move \nforward in the direction of strictly peaceful protest. Your declaration of \na non-sequitur would be more ideally suited to the notion that the span of \ntime between King and Faulkner's deaths, as well as King's distance from \nthe scene of Faulkner's killing have any bearing on why it is invalid to \nmention King and Jamal in the same sentence. What do the former two have to \ndo with the third? Let's face it, the foundation for this conversation was \nthe soft soil on which to plant a carnival tent to put on a spectacle for \nthe Trump-supporting types who are not at all preoccupied with the facts \nand evidence of the guest, but the empty grunts and gesticulations of the \nself-impressed host. All dressing, no salad. Fox News' success is based on \nthe age-old truism that perception is reality. Well, that and the \nshort-skirt factor.

Well, long story short, their beginnings are not based in the \nconcept of racial equality, but rather they initiated as a direct arm of \ninstitutionalized white oppression in America, and still bear remnants of \nthat beginning i.e. the stamp of their lowly origin. So again, \"hero\" is \nrelative. To those who directly oppose white supremacy in dismissal of Dr. \nKings philosophy and tactic, no doubt, Jamal would represent a blow to the \nsystem as significant in it's force as legislation knocking down some \naspect of formalized racism in society. So ultimately it's as simple as \n\"different strokes for different folks\", but there is nothing written in \nthe fabric of reality that establishes either one of these gentlemen as \nheroes, it's merely a matter of opinion, thus the idiocy of Kelly's whole \nargument.

Instead, all Cook could get himself to say \nwas \"I ain't got nuthin' to do with it!\" Yes, Freeman was killed in the \n1985 MOVE disaster - perpetrated under a BLACK mayor in Wilson Goode. \nHowever, Cook and his brother had three whole years to finger Freeman, who \ndidn't even bother leaving Philadelphia and whose whereabouts were \nwell-known by police. It's pretty convenient now, over two decades after \nthe fact in 2001, that Cook blamed Freeman in a sworn affidavit.

The \"Myth of the Running Man\" that \nProfessor Fernandez mentions (2:12) is a recycled lie that is a mere \npatchwork crock that takes bits and pieces of court testimony and \neyewitness reports on the night when Wesley Cook (a.k.a. Mumia Abu Jamal) \nbrutally murdered Officer Daniel Faulkner and assembles those bits into one \ndesperate narrative. The four witnesses who supposedly identified the \nRunning Man as the shooter were: 1) Dessie Hightower, 2) Deborah Kordansky, \n3) Veronica Jones and 4) Robert Chobert. First, Hightower reported that he \nwas going to his car in the parking lot of Club Whispers, heard gunshots, \nlooked up, looked down and looked up again and saw two men running from the \nscene. Never mind that Hightower didn't see the actual murder. What the \nprofessor likely won't say is that Hightower described one of those men as \na 6\"0 dreadlocked person wearing a red and black sweater. Is it just a \ncoincidence that Wesley Cook is 6\"0, had/has dreadlocks and wore a red and \nblack jacket on the night of the murder? Second, Kordansky was in her room \nat the St. James Hotel and reported that she heard gun shots, saw police \nsirens then looked out her window. \". Never mind that she never saw the \nmurder. Never mind that she didn't testify at the 1982 trial because she \nwas convinced that her testimony wouldn't advance either the prosecution or \ndefense. All she said to police was that she \"...saw someone run\". She \ndidn't even say which direction the Running Man was running. Maybe she saw \nHightower and his friend, who, according to Hightower, ran toward the scene \nafter hearing gunshots. Maybe she saw prosecution witness Michael Scanlan, \nwho saw the murder then ran from the scene toward Broad Street to look for \npolice to help Officer Faulkner - who was sadly dead by then. Third, \nVeronica Jones was a prostitute who stood on a street corner two whole \nblocks away from the scene. Jones admitted that she was high on drugs at \nthe time and merely said that she only only saw two men jogging across \nLocust St, which essentially means crossing the street. Meanwhile, Jones \ntestified in court that she didn't see anything. Fourth, Robert Chobert was \na PROSECUTION witness who told police that he saw the assailant run from \nthe scene. Chobert was the only witness who actually saw the murder. He \nalso told police that the assailant fell shortly after beginning running \naway. He also identified the fallen man as none other than Wesley Cook, who \nwas - go figure - seated on the sidewalk when police arrived. In fact, \nChobert fingered Wesley Cook in court and said: \"I saw you, buddy! I never \ntook my eyes off of you!\" There was also a fifth witness who contributed to \nthe \"Myth of the Running Man\", William Singletary. However, his fantasy \ntale was suppressed by defense attorneys and Wesley Cook himself because \nhis BS was so outlandish. All that seemingly matters to proponents of \nWesley Cook is that the witnesses used the word \"run\". It's the equivalent \nof Googling the term \"run\" from the witness reports and court testimony and \npiecing the results together to concoct the bogus \"Myth of the Running \nMan\". Pretty lame, huh? So, as you said \"adding untruths is wrong\". \nHowever, you're blaming the wrong people of doing so. Practice what you \npreach to stonegroovejason, and read the entire case.

It is easy to support Mumia when all you have is pro-Mumia \npropaganda. I used to support him too. But then I actually started \nresearching the case and I found out that the case against him was solid \nand the propaganda was blatantly lying.  One of his own lawyers admitted \nthat some of the \"witnesses\" who were brought forward in his appeals \nhearings were completely full of crap.\n\nWhen I saw how his supporters treated his victim, and his victim's wife, it \nmade me sick. If Mumia really was some innocent pacifist that we should all \nbe looking up to as a paragon of virtue why is it OK for his supporters to \nsay they are glad that Officer Faulkner was killed and they wish his widow \nwould die too?

So \nusing that to try and bypass addressing the issues I brought up is \nintellectually dishonest.  \n\n\nI said some vulgar things because I am so frustrated with people who know \nnothing about the case other than sound bites from pro-Mumia propaganda \nranting and raving at me when I try to have a civilized discussion with \nthem. When people try to have a civilized discussion with me I am nothing \nbut courteous to them.\n\n\nAs far as sources Johanna didn't provide a single one.  So to be \ncondescending to me about sources while not calling out Suzanna on it is \nhypocritical.  I didn't put lots of references in my post but I linked you \nto a site that has the actual trial transcripts. If you read through them \nand can find ANY instance where I am wrong I would be happy to hear it.\n\n\nI have read extensively about this case on both sides of the argument. I \nreferred you to http://danielfaulkner.com/myths-about-mumia/ as it actually \nprovides arguments for both sides based off of the facts. They don't just \nshow you one side and expect you to accept it like every pro-Mumia site out \nthere.\n\n\nAs it stands you claim to know nothing about the case but you want to \nlecture me about it and be condescending. I provided evidence that is \ndocumented in the trial transcripts if you bother to read them. You can \ndownload and read the trial transcripts at \nhttp://danielfaulkner.com/docs/Transcripts.pdf  \n\n\nThere are lots of people who have been wrongfully convicted. Mumia isn't \none of them."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxWeUNA2NrL7A7UZUMHs8Yw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Brick Top", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13eyn5r1sbgsnzd222hjrk4tunkjjgik04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-24T21:50:03.390Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxWeUNA2NrL7A7UZUMHs8Yw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46184399999999998, "formal_score": 36, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-24T21:50:03.390Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116075697191801807828", "textDisplay": "+stonegroovejason  Yep, as I mentioned in one of my earlier posts about how \nyou have probably been reading a bunch of junk articles on the subject \n(mentally speaking, you are losing it with these vulgar rants).\n\nHave you ever been to college?

Mumia is innocent.\n\nMy Rebuttal------------------------------------------------------------\nJust saying that doesn't make it so without evidence. So let's see what she \nhas.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. On the night that Officer Faulkner was shot there were four persons at \nthe crime scene. But the prosecutor, Joe McGill, and the trial judge, \nAlbert Sabo, concealed the presence at the crime scene of that fourth \nperson at trial. In fact, the presence of that fourth person, the passenger \nin the Volkswagen which Officer Faulkner had stopped, was acknowledged by \nprosecutor Joe McGill in another trial that was happening concurrently, \nsurrounding the same crime scene. This key, exculpatory evidence -- that \nthere was another person at the crime scene who was the passenger -- was \nhidden from the defense and the jury. Why?\n\n\nMy Rebuttal------------------------------------------------------------\nThere was nothing to conceal. The four witnesses she is referring to are \nDebra Kordansky, Desie Hightower, Veronica, and Robert Chobert. Of those \nfour witnesses only Robert Chobert said he saw the actual shooting. The \nrest admitted that they didn't see anything until AFTER the shooting was \nfinished. Thus they have NO WAY of identifying any shooted much less \nclaiming the shooter ran and managed to get away.\n\n1. Debra Kordansky\n\nMs. Kordansky stated that she was in her bedroom watching TV when the \nshooting occurred. In her original statement to police she said that she \n\u201cdidn\u2019t go to her window until drawn there by the flashing lights of the \npolice cars that had already arrived on the scene\u201d. She also stated while \nlooking out her window, she saw \u201csomeone run.\u201d While being questioned by \nLeonard Weinglass at the 1995 PCRA hearing, Kordansky specifically stated \nthat this person \u201cwas not the shooter\u201d and that \u201cthey ran after police had \nalready arrived\u201d. (N.T. 8/3/95, 248-249)\n\n2. Desie Hightower\n\nMr. Hightower stated that he was down the street, behind a building in a \nparking lot, getting into a car when the shooting occurred. When asked by \npolice at the scene if he could identify Jamal as the shooter Hightower \ntold them, \u201cI couldn\u2019t say, because I didn\u2019t see the officer actually \nshot.\u201d (N.T. 6/28/82, 28.131)\n\n3. Veronica Jones\n\nMs. Jones has always stated that she was over 2 blocks away, around a \ncorner and behind a building, when Officer Faulkner was shot. In 1996 she \ntestified that she \u201cwaited for a few minutes\u201d before looking around the \ncorner to see what happened and that she then saw two men approach Officer \nFaulkner\u2019s body. She further stated, \u201cI was not there, I did not see him \n[the shooter].\u201d (N.T. 10/1/96, 24)\n\nShe neglects to mention that there were four other witnesses in addition to \nRobert Chobert who actually saw the shooting. Each of them gave separate \nreports to separate officers that all said the shooter ran to the scene, \nkilled Officer, ran a few feet and then collapsed on the corner which is \nexactly where Mumia was found with his gun by his side with all of the \nshots having been fired.\n\nYou can read more in depth information at \nhttp://danielfaulkner.com/myths-about-mumia/myth-2/ \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. It is well documented, in declassified memos, that the Philadelphia \npolice in consultation with COINTELPRO had for many years been trying to \npeg a crime on former Black Panther and muckraking radio journalist, Mumia \nAbu-Jamal, whose reporting on police brutality, corruption in City Hall and \nthe MOVE organization had long been a thorn on the side of the \nestablishment. Now the Philadelphia police had their man and they were \ngoing to do everything in their power to frame him.\n\nMy Rebuttal------------------------------------------------------------\nAll that is documented in the memos was that Mumia was a Black Panther. The \nthing she is completely leaving out is that Mumia had lost his radio job a \nyear before he murdered Officer Faulkner because he lost his objective and \nwas so obsessed with MOVE that he didn't talk about anything but that. \nThere was no need for the FBI, or anyone else for that matter, to silence \nhim as he had already silenced himself with his actions. If he hadn't been \narrested he most certainly wouldn't have the national attention he got \nwhich gave him a platform to pontificate from.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. The clearest sign that the Abu-Jamal trial was a miscarriage of justice \ncame only two weeks after the end of the trial, when its lead investigator, \npolice inspector Alfonzo Giordano, was tried and eventually convicted of \nrank corruption, extortion and tampering with evidence.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n- Notice that she mentions one police inspector instead of the 15 she \ntalked about in the FOX interview. So let's examine both of them. \n\nAlfonzo Giordana was arrested for accepting bribes in 1986 which is 5 years \nafter the murder not two weeks. He was not charged or convicted for \nevidence tampering. \n\nThe 15 officers who were arrested and convicted for evidence tampering that \nshe talked about on the FOX interview were arrested and convicted for \nevidence tampering in 1979. For those keeping count that was two years \nbefore Mumia killed Officer Faulkner. For her claim that these cops were \narrested for tampering with evidence in this case to be possible would \nrequire a time machine.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Because almost all the jurors that heard Mumia's case were white, they \nbelieved the testimony of the police. A jury of Mumia's peers would have \nknown better. Shortly after Mumia's trial, one third of the police officers \ninvolved in collecting evidence in his case were convicted of corruption \nand tampering with evidence to obtain a conviction. Happening concurrently \nwas also an investigation of the Philadelphia Police Department by the US \nDepartment of Justice -- the largest ever conducted of a police department \nin the United States. That investigation concluded that the level of \ncorruption and tampering with evidence on the part of the Philadelphia \npolice and its homicidal behavior against black and brown detainees \"shocks \nthe conscience.\"\n\n\nMy Rebuttal \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst off this statement is racist as it suggests that being Black would \neffect one's viewing of the evidence and testimony. As if the facts don't \nmatter to Black people. The problem is they needed a unanimous verdict to \nconvict Mumia of a Capital Crime. If the Blacks on they jury didn't believe \nthe testimony and evidence displayed at trial they could have easily voted \nnot guilty and Mumia wouldn't have been eligible for the Death Penalty. But \nthese Black jurors saw the evidence and choosed to vote guilty.\n\nAdditionally this leaves out the fact that the relevant eyewitness \ntestimony didn't come from cops. It came from civilians who witnessed the \nmurder. \n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Upon arrival at the scene of the crime, the police who found Mumia on \nthe ground with a bullet from Daniel Faulkner's gun in his gut proceeded to \nbeat Mumia to a pulp and throw him into a paddy wagon where they beat him \nup some more. Approximately an hour later, they drove him to the hospital \nand threw him on the ground at the entrance of the Emergency Room.\n\n\nMy Rebuttal \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nEyewitnesses saw Mumia struggling with police but they didn't report any \nviscious beat downs. If the Police wanted to kill him all they had to do \nwas let him bleed out. But instead they took him to the hospital for \ntreatment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. The prosecution pegged the murder of Officer Daniel Faulkner on Mumia \nbased on the perjured testimony of three witnesses who said, 60 days later, \nthat Mumia confessed to the shooting while in the hospital. This was \ncontradicted, however, by the testimony of Dr. Anthony Coletta, who was \nwith him from the moment he entered the hospital. Dr. Coletta said that \nMumia was barely conscious and in a state of shock, and that the trauma \nproduced by Mumia's bullet wound and the beating he had endured at the \nhands of the cops meant that medically, Mumia was incapable of speaking. In \naddition, the police report written on the night of the incident by the \nofficer assigned to Mumia at the hospital, Gary Wakshul, states that \"The \nNegro male made no comment.\"\n\nMy Rebuttal \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShe neglects to mention that there was a hospital security guard named \nPriscilla Durham who reported his confession to her superior the very next \nday. If the Police were conspiring to fabricate the confession with her \nthey would have had to have their story straight with her at that time. As \nit stands the officers were under a lot of duress and worried about their \nfriend who had been shot. It is more believable that they were too stressed \nout to remember his statement right away than it is they conspired with \nsomeone else to fabricate a confession with 24 hours while not saying it \nthemselves for two months.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n8. The first photographs taken of the crime scene were taken by a regularly \npublished freelance photographer, Pedro Polakoff. He repeatedly called the \npolice to give them those photographs, but the cops never responded. \nPolakoff assumed that Mumia was guilty and forgot about the issue. In 2006 \nthese photographs were discovered and studied by Dr. Michael Schiffman of \nHeidelberg University in Germany. The photos disprove the prosecution's \nentire case theory. They also show that the police lied and tampered with \nevidence. Officer James Forbes, who testified in court that he had properly \nhandled the guns allegedly retrieved at the crime scene, is photographed \nholding the guns with his bare hands, destroying all potentially \nsignificant fingerprints. Most importantly, the Polakoff photos also point \nto the presence of a fourth person at the crime scene: Officer Faulkner's \nhat is pictured resting on top of the Volkswagen on the side of the \npassenger-seat, suggesting that he may have had a conversation with the \npassenger.\n\n\nMy \nRebuttal---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe cops did carry both guns with their bare hands because they didn't live \nin the era of CSI where every single shred of evidence is bagged and \nanalyzed. Mumia had scuffled with the cops when they tried to arrest him \nwhich had already contaminated the crime scene. The thing she neglects to \naddress is that the ONLY scenario that this evidence could exonerate Mumia \nis if she wants to claim that someone else grabbed Mumia's gun and used it \nto shoot it at Officer Faulkner. If the Prosecution had tried to use \nfingerprints on Mumia's gun to prove he shot Faulkner she could have a \nvalid point. Since they didn't do that the gun doesn't prove or disprove \nanything.\n\nAs far as the hat it being on the car or on the ground doesn't prove or \ndisprove anything.\n\n\nAs far as the lack of divots in the ground they are ignoring the large \ngrates in the sidewalk at the scene. It is my belief that he could have \nbeen laying on those when he was shot so divots wouldn't have been \npossible. But that is my opinion. I have no pics of his body to back that \nup.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Exonerating evidence abounds in the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal. Because \nMumia is known the world-over for his commentaries and writings on \ninequality and because he has spent so much of his time in prison offering \na radical critique and analysis of mass incarceration, a victory in Mumia's \ncase would open up a much larger conversation in the mainstream about the \ncrisis of mass and political imprisonment in the US.\n\n\n\nMy Rebuttal \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMumia had three different Post Conviction Relief Act hearings to show \nexonerating evidence. What he brought forward were witnesses who were \ncaught in lies on the stand. \n\nVeronica Jones told a story about having a recent conversation with Cynthia \nWhite (one of the eyewitnesses who actually saw the shooting) wherein \nCynthia told her she had been coerced and threatened into changing her \nstory. All sounded great until the Prosecution brought out Cynthia White's \ndeath certificate that proved that unless Veronica was referring to a \nseance she couldn't have had any conversations with Cynthia at the time she \nclaimed to have had them.\n\nAnother person they brought out named William Singletary claimed to have \nseen a police helicopter flying above the scene and to have heard Danny \ntelling him to take care of Danny's wife and kids as he lay dying. One \nproblem with this are the Philadelphia police didn't have any helicopters \nin their force until years later. Another problem is Danny and his wife had \nonly been married a year and didn't have any kids. And finally the autopsy \nreport indicates that Danny died instantly from the bullet wound to the \nface so he wouldn't have been capable of talking anyway.\n\nThe Defense brought out a guy named Arnold Beverly who claimed that he was \nthe real shooter. He claimed to have been paid by the mob and the police to \nassassinate Officer Faulkner. He claims to have been waiting at the scene \nof the crime to make the hit but he doesn't explain how he knew the time \nand place Faulkner would be there on a random car stop. He claimed there \nwere other police officers there with him who shot Jamal even though the \nballistics evidence proves that the bullet in Mumia came from Officer \nFaulkner's gun to the exclusion of every other gun on the planet.

If you are serious about wanting to research this case \nyou need to hear both sides of the story. Not just Mumia's spin. If you \nreally want to watch the pro-Mumia \"A Long Distance Revolutionary\" you \nshould also watch \"The Barrel of a Gun\".

But the fact is the evidence against Mumia is overwhelming without \nthis incident.\n\n\nThe fact is Mumia's brother Billy Cok saw what happened and has always \nrefused to come forward. This is particularly important when you realize \nthat the alleged 4th person Mumia's supporters claim is the real shooter \nwas supposedly riding in Billy's car. The people who they allege to be the \n4th person all claim they were paid off by the police, mafia, etc. to kill \nOfficer Faulkner. Either it was a spectacular coincidence that they got \npulled over by the specific officer they were hired to kill or else Billy \nwas in on the alleged scheme. Either scenario is ridiculous to anyone with \ncommon sense.\n\n\nThe other issue is that if the police were conspiring to wrongfully convict \nMumia why would they leave contradictory paper trails behind? Why not \nreplace the original reports with ones that back up Durham's report?  \n\n\nAnd for that matter why did they even leave Mumia alive? Officer Shoemaker \nsaid that when he arrived on the scene Mumia was sitting on the curb with \nhis gun next to him. Mumia tried to pick up the gun but Shoemaker kicked it \naway. He could have shot Mumia dead on the spot and justified it as \nself-defense. If it was all a scheme to silence Mumia why waste a perfect \nopportunity to shut him up permanently? \n\n\nThe only relevant evidence the Defense has managed to come up that hasn't \nbeen proven to be complete bullshit was the photos of the crime scene. They \nclaim that there should have been bullet marks in the pavement and use the \nabsence of noticeable markings as proof of innocence. If there weren't huge \nmetal grates in the sidewalk I could see their point. But since those \ngrates exist right where the crime happened it is entirely possible that \nthe shots went in the drain under the grates.\n\n\nThey also claim that the police didn't handle the guns in what we consider \na proper way in the age of CSI which is entirely true. If they had been \nusing fingerprints on the guns as evidence in the trial the case would have \nbeen thrown out. They neglect to realize the guns being handled were \nlegally registered to Officer Faulkner and Mumia. Unless you are claiming \nsomeone else grabbed Mumia's gun to shoot Faulkner it is a moot point. And \nagain if this was a frame job why not take the guns over to the hospital \nand ensure Mumia's fingerprints were on there? But since he owned the gun \nit would still be a moot point.\n\n\nWhat it comes down to is Mumia's followers constantly try to shift the \nfocus away from the salient points of the case and try to distract people \nwith talks of police corruption and racism without explaining how those \ncould change the actual facts of the case in any way. You can say the \npolice were corrupt but it doesn't explain the issues in this case."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CyDstTDlLr9e5MoVrTfAA", "inappropriate_score": 0.40485829959514169, "authorDisplayName": "john capone", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134stqjopzaijxkj22sel5j0rbfwhn0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-04T17:50:08.024Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5CyDstTDlLr9e5MoVrTfAA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.6425240000000001, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-04T17:50:08.024Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115780698811663062171", "textDisplay": "+Jason Reynolds\n I don't know, Jason, I'm not gonna try to explain the actions of Philly Pd \nback in those days, they were corrupt to their core.

Mumia Abu Jamal) has no one to blame but himself for \nthe racially unbalanced jury. Please remind the professor that Cook used \nmost of his preemptive challenges at jury selection to excuse white jurors \nbut still had challenges to use. Prosecutor Joe McGill challenged ten \nprospective black jurors because they 1) knew who Cook was, 2) heard his \nradio program at least once or 3) were against the death penalty. McGill \nstill had ten challenges left but didn't use them on the black jurors who \nremained and ultimately served.

But, lately I have been noticing that the average Conservative, not \njust the far right, are rather \"extreme\". What I fail to see everywhere is \nsome one who can see straight down the middle. Nothing so Conservative, \nthat we are demonizing others that have nothing to do with us, and nothing \nso Liberal that we are overlooking the degradation of societal morals.... \nYou, in your statement, demonize every person that would call themselves a \nLiberal, no matter what reason they have for it.

The professor is an \nidiot who is spewing bullshit that was already proven to be absolutely \nwrong decades ago.\n\n\nI'll break it down for you:\n1:23 - 1:46 - She claims the \"racially coded language\" used to describe \nMumia stand in the way of really exploring what happened in this case.  \n\n\nThe words she cites are convicted cop killer, thug, and militant. There are \nno racial descriptions in ANY of these terms.  \n\n\nConvicted cop killer is a factual description. Even if someone thinks he is \ninnocent in the eyes of the law he was convicted of murdering a cop.  \nAs far as thug the word has become so generic that it really can't describe \nanything specific. But when you consider the racist epithets he used \nagainst his own Black attorney its a moot point. Mumia describes himself as \na militant so blame him for that.\n\n\nNone of these prevent anyone from exploring the case. If it did she \nwouldn't have explored it.\n\n\n1:45 - 1:48 She says Mumia Abu Jamal is innocent. She doesn't bring any \nevidence to prove or disprove this. She could just as soon say that Ted \nBundy is innocent. Without any facts presented to back it up it's just a \nstatement of opinion after all.\n\n\n1:51 - 2:07 She alludes to facts of this case not coming to light because \nof the influence on the Fraternal Order of Police on the Prosecution, the \nJudge, and the Jury. She doesn't explain how they actually kept ANYTHING \nfrom coming to light. If they had NOBODY would know about it including her. \nInstead it seems more like she is using her own \"racially coded language\" \nto influence people.\n\n\n2:08 - 2:32 She claims that there was a fourth person at the scene who was \nidentified by four people as the shooter who ran away after the shooting. \nThis is a deliberate twisting of facts. NONE of the witnesses alluded to a \nfourth person being at the scene. They said the shooter shot the cop and \ntried to run away but didn't get very far before sitting down on the curb \nwhich was EXACTLY where Mumia was found. These witnesses clearly identified \nMumia as said shooter. The ONLY people who claimed there was a fourth \nperson at the scene were people who claimed to be the fourth shooter. There \nis no evidence to actually place them there other than their own statement. \nAdditionally the claims additional claims they included in their statements \nwere proven to be complete fabrications which proved their testimony was \ncomplete bullshit.\n\n\n3:16 - 3:39 The professor states that 15 of the police involved in the \ncollection of evidence for this case were jailed and convicted for \ntampering with evidence, corruption, and extortion IN THIS CASE and claims \nit is in the records. This is factually impossible because their \nconvictions and incarceration for said offences occurred over two years \nbefore Officer Faulkner was murdered. It doesn't matter how corrupt the \nPhilly PD was in other cases if you have absolutely no way to prove \ncorruption occurred in this case. The Defense has tried numerous times to \nprove there was corruption by bringing forward surprise witnesses to \ntestify but have been caught lying every single time. The only verifiable \ndishonesty in this case has always occurred from the Defense teams.\n\n\n3:40 - 3:56 The professor complains that \"one of the most important people \nin this case\" Ron Castille refused to recuse himself from the trial and \nfrom hearing Mumia's appeal. The problem is Ron Castille wasn't the trial \njudge. The other issue was that the hearings they wanted him to recuse \nhimself from weren't about if Mumia should get a new trial. The issue at \nhand was if Mumia should get a new SENTENCING HEARING because Mumia's \nlawyers managed to convince a previous appelate Judge that maybe the \nsentencing directions given to the original jury could have possibly \nconfused them. They never actually asked the jury if they found the \ndirections confusing in any way. Mumia's guilt wasn't even under \nconsideration in this hearing. But because Castille had a positive \nrelationship with the FOP it could only be a conflict of interest in the \nprofessor's eyes.\n\n\n4:02 - 4:33 The professor shifts gears and plays the race card. She claims \nthat there is a long history of criminalization of Black people and that \nMumia wasn't judged by a jury of his peers. She completely ignores the \nblatant racism she is espousing by saying if Mumia's jury was all Black it \nwould have changed the outcome regardless of the actual facts of the case. \nShe doesn't understanding that racism is when a person is judged because of \ntheir race instead of the facts. It doesn't mean that every time something \nbad happens to a Black person it is racism.\n\n\n4:34 - 4:57 - The professor then wants to back track to the Castille issue \nto explain why Mumia hasn't been granted relief without ANY explanation for \nwhy he deserves it based on the case facts.\n\n\nIt scares me that a person with this level of complete stupidity and \nintellectual dishonesty could be allowed to teach ANYONE much less get paid \nto do it!!!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_GpT59BF7R2-oZ6wrYHMPQ", "inappropriate_score": 11.764705882352942, "authorDisplayName": "Johny comelately", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cst5anpy3tdh5w04ch3m4jtvbunyzbgg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-13T07:51:11.891Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_GpT59BF7R2-oZ6wrYHMPQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.94858599999999993, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-13T07:51:11.891Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yOmK1Ikj_Ro/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABII/PnDSA20qLg0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118057512284107270211", "textDisplay": "+Leo Rising Fox news rules...you gay ass trol"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1dNKbwBY2uGvuPPbxRjq7w", "inappropriate_score": 3.9215686274509802, "authorDisplayName": "Leo Rising", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cst5anpy3tdh5w04ch3m4jtvbunyzbgg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-03T23:11:24.138Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1dNKbwBY2uGvuPPbxRjq7w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.14823999999999998, "formal_score": 51, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-03T23:11:24.138Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z0nv3pX0Id8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/YBPVgb6Cf1Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114527046689232853625", "textDisplay": "+Rick Hayes you obviously take your blonde bitches tits and ignorance of \nthe evidence being proved.
