"+Michaels Eagle If a person wants to get a gun, they will. We see that in \nthis country not just with marijuana but other drugs as well. And, yes, I \ndo know that people aren't going around killing each other with drugs. The \npoint is that people will find a way around the law. Back to the guns, \nsure, we limit the availability and therefore, slightly reduce gun \nviolence, but in the end, can we really quantify how many acts of gun \nviolence we will have avoided by preventing mentally ill people from \npurchasing them legally?\n\nWhat happens when a mentally ill person still manages to acquire a gun and \ncommit an act of violence with it despite not purchasing it from licensed \ndealer? Who do we blame then; the criminals that sold him the gun \nillegally? We already have laws against that. Or, let's say the crazy guy \ncan't get a gun; what's to stop him from committing an act of violence \nwithout one?\n\n\nThe real reason I brought this up is not so much to tell you that you're \nwrong because from an ethical standpoint, I do agree with you, but I think \nit overlooks the other more important details of these types of situations \nsuch as: 1.) People break laws all the time for a multitude of reasons \nunder a multitude of circumstances. We just happen to fixate on this \nviolation more because of the horrible outcome of it; and 2.) Should we \ncreate laws for something that doesn't provide a definitive solution?\n\n\nMy issues with this is that it's such a fuckin cop-out to simply look at \nlimiting the mentally ill having access to automatic weaponry as the \nsolution. We have potentially violent, mentally ill people \"wandering\" \naround this country, what are we doing about that? That should be the real \nquestion.\n\n\nLastly, I just want to add this. The reason a lot of these guns-rights \nadvocates don't bend and are so hardcore on these issues is because once \nthey allow one restriction to be made, it sets precedent for other \nrestrictions to be made. I know that's seems rather absolute but having \ntalked to a few guys like that in person, that's pretty much exactly what \nthey've told me; that once they compromise on one issue, they'll set \nthemselves up to have to go on the defensive against whatever special \ninterest group that wants to regulate guns in the future."}}]}, "z132w1o5usu3z3lgq04ccp2a5q3tv3yolz40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYjMr6Ik-60QnL09_dRARQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Maxim Lekov", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-31T03:17:55.744Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYYjMr6Ik-60QnL09_dRARQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.82328200000000007, "formal_score": 75, "updatedAt": "2014-12-31T03:19:02.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116732945658555173075", "textDisplay": "There is nothing wrong with owning a gun, but you should have to walk \nthrough hoops and go through months and months of training and paperwork to \nget one, period. this system of walking in off the street and buying \nbasically whatever you want is a joke. and no background checks? wow what a \njoke\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z124u1bresznw541f23cud2yyunuy5ela": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMOzC7wr0rAHONINSvOtsHA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YbHJPBCk_r4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADg/sniFFidgQSw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Helen Richeal", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-23T04:47:58.418Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMOzC7wr0rAHONINSvOtsHA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.83010040000000007, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-12-23T04:47:58.418Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101142781678869669840", "textDisplay": "If I had to choose how to be murdered I would want it to be by a gun. \nStrangulation takes too long getting poisoned is painful and take too long. \nStabbing is painful and again takes too long.

It's imagine we talk about bridge suicides instead.\n\nIn the city called No-Bridges there is not one suicide by bridge. But in \nthe city called Lots-Of-Bridges there are 20 suicides by bridge every year.\n\nLooking at bridge suicides in a vacuum is simply stupid and retarded. It \nwill create the impression that the bridges are the cause of the suicide. \nBut such is not the case. It's just that those who want to kill themselves \nare more likely to jump off a bridge if obe is accessible to them. The \nbridge obviously didn't cause the suicide.\n\nSame thing with murder. I have several guns. And I do not intent to kill \nanyone, be it myself or someone else. But if I ever decided to kill \nsomeone, I would be more likely to use my guns. But of course my guns don't \nsomehow cause me to kill people.\n\nStatistics can be extremely misleading in the wrong hands.\n\nFor example, when the German government killed 6 million Jews, those Jews \nnever became part of any German crime statistics. When the US government \nkilled 3 million Vietnameses in the Vietnam War,  not one of those 3 \nmillions killed became part of any US murder statistics.\nSame goes with the 1 million Iraqis killed in the Iraq war. Nor one became \npart of the US murder statistics.\n\nAll these deaths were never entered into government crime statistics \nbecause when government kills, they call it justifiable or necessary.  They \nnever enter their own killings in crime stats.\n\nBut in reality, if you are to bundle all war deaths (deaths caused by \ngovernment warranted war) and all decided (government killing it's own \npeople) than you because faced with the following fact: you are \nstatistically 4 times more likely to die from a government gun (your own or \nforeign) than you are to die from a civilian gun.\n\nThe simple fact is that government is by far the most important 'gun crime' \nkiller.\n\nThink about that next time your government decides to talk about gun crime \nto establish more laws to protect you.\n\nThe biggest service you can ever do to yourself is to realize that \ngovernment doesn't love you. Government simple doesn't care about you.\n\nThey will likely jump up and down to bring in more laws when they talk \nabout gun crime statistics. They love you that much. Than they turn around \nand send you in a war to die and kill for them all based on a now \nunderstood lies: Saddam's non-existant weapons of mass destruction."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBprVecq64vMJXovn6kFTYg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kenneth Lee", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ohvdiuojrgvriu04ce52yqvrwuveoxl40k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-18T22:56:03.119Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBprVecq64vMJXovn6kFTYg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.13341599999999998, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-18T22:56:03.119Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4pLGUFRsQ7Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADOA/nPa07C7_01A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109130614380345130750", "textDisplay": "It's all about how people perceive things.

The suicide thing I get, and as \nsomeone with a compassionate soul, I do believe if someone truly doesn't \nwant to live anymore then no one has the right to tell them otherwise. But \nthat's neither here nor there. What we have in America is not a gun \nproblem, we have a gang/violent crime problem. In the inner cities where \nmost violent acts take place, they are mostly repeat offenders which means \nalready felons. Not allowed by law to own a gun anyway. Yet, they still get \nthem. And as well, the thing nobody seems to get is that if someone wants \nyou dead, they're gonna kill you no matter the weapon or method. I mean \nwould you feel better if they were pushed out of windows? Or stabbed \nrepeatedly being forced to die a slow agonizing death? And in the UK gun \ndeaths may not be prevalent but violent crime sure as fuck is. The above \nsaid is true about suffering a stabbing there vs a gunshot here. As a law \nabiding citizen, I personally carry a gun every day. I live in a rural \narea, with low crime, but work in a city with an above average crime rate. \nNow, as I said we have a crime problem in this country, but we also have a \ngod damned bleeding heart problem, in which criminals have more rights than \ntheir victims. I'll be fucking damned if some panty waisted bleeding heart \npussy is gonna tell me that they had the right to take my car, or break in \nmy home or rob me or even take my life because they were less privileged \nthan I. That's like saying it's the woman's fault she was raped because she \nwas attractive. It's called get off your lazy useless ass and get a goddamn \njob, and work for something. I have never pulled my gun on anyone. But I \ncan tell you that without a second thought, or a microsecond's hesitation \nthat I will, and I will fire until the threat stops should I be placed in a \nsituation where my life, or more importantly my family's life is in danger. \nI don't play the underprivileged pity game nor does my heart bleed. As I \nsaid I am a compassionate person, and have stopped a robbery before, but \nagain I did not brandish my firearm. But I believe you have the right to \nhave what anyone else does only if you work for it. Not steal it. And let's \nface it, most murders are committed during robberies. Yes some are pure \nhatred driven, and some are the effects of mental illness. And in those \nkinds of situations, I also defy anyone to tell me I can't use lethal force \nto stop that threat. Fortunately I do live in a gun friendly state, and I \nthink retards like this pompous British cocksucker need to wake up and \nrealize that denying us a right to self defense will only make things \nworse. And i promise you that the day his door is kicked in, or God forbid \nhe has to watch his wife be beaten or raped, or is the victim of some \nheinous crime, he will wish he had a gun. And making guns illegal will only \nkeep law abiding citizens from owning them, and leave us defenseless. How \ndo I know? Well, drugs sure as hell aren't legal are they? Yet this country \nis now facing the worst drug problem in 30 years. New drug types are being \ninvented all the time, adding to the rampancy of it all. Meth, cocaine, \nheroin, pills, acid, pcp, you name it. So if drugs are so easy for \ncriminals to get, how hard would a gun be? And I'm no gun nut. I own a \ncouple different types of sporting shotguns for fowl, and a rifle for deer \nand medium game because I do so love the taste of fresh deer meat, and 3 \nhandguns. One full size carried in a shoulder holster, one light compact \ncarried in a pocket holster when I'm dressed casually or during the summer \nmonths when it wouldn't be conducive to carry in a shoulder rig, and one \nthat stays on my nightstand. No children to worry about otherwise it would \nbe in a lock box until bed time.

Even if in your case it would be for \n''justice'' or ''protection'' it's still quite unnecessary in the context \nof mugging you used and the very fact that there will always be a minority \nwho would mis-use guns means that they should be banned to all civilians. \nJust to make the world a safer place... you think having a gun makes the \nUSA safer i bet?

But yes i am \nenjoying my Tea, thank you :D.\n\n''Gun crimes are hardly a statistic'' HAHA stats:-\n\nAccording to the office of US crime 67% of all homicides in the USA are \ndone using a firearm... You might say that without a gun they'd e.g. just \nuse a knife... But britain is an example of that. Most murders here are \ndone with knives... A much lower fatality rate. It's harder to kill using a \nknife so many just wouldnt bother trying to kill as it's too much effort \ncompared to using a gun and even then if you do try to kill somebody it's \nmuch more likely they survive a knife attack than a shooting.\n\nThere are ten of thousands of gun crime related murders each year in the \nUSA with most involving handguns (arent handguns most easily accessible?) \nOver 10,000 deaths directly caused by firearms\n\nIn the UK e.g. where firearms are not obtainable by civilians the numbers \nare 42 deaths last year...\n\nLet me round this off by commenting on your attitude to your fiance being \nmugged...It's a terrible thing when something like that happens certainly. \nBut in a place without guns\n(i assume the perps were using a gun as otherwise you will have wanted to \nshoot ''dead'' an unarmed individual) it would be a much better place. She \ncould freely defend herself and any people near the incident/ the police \ncould easily catch the mugger.\n\nThe very fact you think shooting a person dead in response to a mild crime \nlike mugging shows your have the completely wrong attitude with guns. You \ntalk of gun respect. It's a lethal weapon. If your girl gets mugged you \nstand up like a man and make that perp see justice. Justice is NOT and \nNEVER will be getting shot dead.\n\nThen when you are being downed for your crime and you hear the mugger's \nyoung family talk of all the bad breaks they had in life and their childs' \nneed for paid private healthcare (another idiocy by the USA) being the \nreason for the act of love for their child/need to support their family. \nYou would (i hope) regret the fact you had killed a person who was only \ndesperate. That's what mugging is. A crime of desperation. So you wanting \nto kill the guy is a disgrace.\n\nRemember not everybody is as lucky as you, they dont all get paid to commit \ncowardly war crimes on behalf of the US government.\n\nStop hiding behind your guns and grow a pair of bollocks you coward."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcPKkEtvplnb4uloilSU6ag", "inappropriate_score": 0.41928721174004191, "authorDisplayName": "Intellectual Infantryman", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12yvvdibkzafbty204cfveaknnywzwasqs0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-09T05:55:58.755Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCcPKkEtvplnb4uloilSU6ag"}, "sentiment_score": -0.16877600000000004, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-09T05:55:58.755Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TANtidMgE7c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEI/Z2pHJtxFFm4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109542246283460430920", "textDisplay": "+Chris Torode You should probably stay out of a debate that doesn't belong \nto you.

As stated above a \nfelony conviction doesn't automatically strip you of your voting \nprivileges. Also, their movements, once their debt to society has been \npaid, are in no way restricted. And they cannot be restricted at a whim \nbecause at this point they are just like any other person in America with \nthe exception of having a felony conviction to deal with.\n\nFinally \"many\" are NOT mandated to take weekly drug testing unless they \nhave a felony drug conviction and are out on parole or happen to get lucky \nand only got probation. You should really do some research before making \nthe claims you put in your post. Having a felony conviction myself I can \ntell you that in my state (Michigan) I vote, I can own land, if I take the \nrequired classes I can even get a CCW permit. So what you hear can be \nvastly different than what really is."}}]}, "z12fi3w4wsi5utm14231tvzwjrybgthbp04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg6zehXFTu33ZB8AUg8LQEA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GP6kjMDU628/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACE/d9q3MW6ZIXg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 5.882352941176471, "authorDisplayName": "commontheory", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-16T11:10:29.450Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCg6zehXFTu33ZB8AUg8LQEA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.60179399999999994, "formal_score": 44, "updatedAt": "2015-09-16T11:10:29.450Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113375723237232788279", "textDisplay": "Morgan is such a fucking TOOL what a joke.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12icjip2wjqw5k3a23puh2gfui5flreh": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5AO7l5ot2M8BORinetNHQg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sc3qsqySwv0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/ArpncdqxGfo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Glenn Webster", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-22T09:03:28.854Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5AO7l5ot2M8BORinetNHQg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.85056960000000004, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2015-04-22T09:03:28.854Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103664043577127504355", "textDisplay": "Piers swallows!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": ""}, "z134g1arvqrvi3p5t04cd3lrxzmtupahkr40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 39, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdRbZKF5JhUpJQnhKyu0d1Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nyLxAID2tW0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/Y_ar_7754M4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 2.8571428571428572, "authorDisplayName": "101danny", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-23T18:05:01.545Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdRbZKF5JhUpJQnhKyu0d1Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.089226000000000028, "formal_score": 71, "updatedAt": "2015-08-23T18:05:01.545Z", "likeCount": 17, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113482330660305835505", "textDisplay": "The more I listen to piers talking over someone, the more I disrespect him. \nLET THE MAN ANSWER YOUR FUCKING QUESTIONS PIERS!

But his animosity, disrespect and total contempt \nfor the Americans represented by this sitting government official was \nterribly uncalled for.\n\nIn Britain it is common place for the news media to berate and browbeat \ntheir politicians, and for politicians to even daily browbeat each other in \nparliament. They literally heckle each other which is what Piers was \nobviously emulating. Typical daily British parliament. Great British TV. \n\nPeirs just, unfortunately, held the right interview in the wrong country - \nor, the wrong interview in the right country.\n\nStill love Peirs and the OK Representative (Must've been his worst day, but \nhe did very well under fire). \n\nHope they both survived the ordeal.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13zsd0yzsupdholg22rdrlycnrljbefd": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Jp5OHbxY3Zlu3nhGh3shg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wI5Ej0kk9IM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/rLPyEjjAS8w/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Adam Pratt", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-30T20:15:03.303Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7Jp5OHbxY3Zlu3nhGh3shg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2015-01-30T20:15:03.303Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104653306201852180997", "textDisplay": ""}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13mzt0b5lrripwm323nehaj0viyfdhk3": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6LSlnrEQU2nBAUORO_1QJg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FvMQfiZufNk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOY/9NKlViQHKYA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Sweet", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-09T05:00:07.388Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6LSlnrEQU2nBAUORO_1QJg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.19911799999999996, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-09T05:00:07.388Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105982380214875870904", "textDisplay": "yeah I was expecting a producer to come out and say pierce you're gone, \ntitle is misleading.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12eureiiwa1fjxnb23ghnogmmvkjxibe04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydZsunQqPM6uHmgS6NmqIg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 14.285714285714286, "authorDisplayName": "whiff1962", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-25T06:41:47.132Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCydZsunQqPM6uHmgS6NmqIg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.95150970000000001, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-02-25T06:41:47.132Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103585028829664374475", "textDisplay": "Good riddance, smarmy prick. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13sip5q0mjix1z4n04cdnkxdn33f1bbdzc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjLWxj8qZwF7J-tbamO0zzw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "john smith", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-07T17:09:25.948Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjLWxj8qZwF7J-tbamO0zzw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.93287439999999999, "formal_score": 98, "updatedAt": "2015-04-07T17:09:25.948Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104512842316837290601", "textDisplay": "There is absolutely no reason to think your about to see Pierce Morgan Get \nhanded a pink slip.

The \nhighest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army \ncan be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the \nwhole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear \narms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of \nmore than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a \nmilitia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their \nhands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their \ncommon liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their \naffections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus \ncircumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular \ntroops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance \nof this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the \npossibility of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the \nAmericans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the \nexistence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and \nby which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the \nenterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple \ngovernment of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military \nestablishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far \nas the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the \npeople with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they \nwould not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess \nthe additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who \ncould collect the national will and direct the national force, and of \nofficers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached \nboth to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest \nassurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily \noverturned in spite of the legions which surround it. Let us not insult the \nfree and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion, that they would be \nless able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession, \nthan the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from \nthe hands of their oppressors. Let us rather no longer insult them with the \nsupposition that they can ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making \nthe experiment, by a blind and tame submission to the long train of \ninsidious measures which must precede and produce it.*\n-- James Madison, Federalist #46\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13cep3izye0wfoto23yvlggyomvh3lyv04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4vXb6UhmRl10SDJ4Znnmg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mMA5p8UDCVM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/Y4AQ2Ta-3ic/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jazreldedondru", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-08T02:14:24.421Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCb4vXb6UhmRl10SDJ4Znnmg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.51430200000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-08T02:14:40.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109578566979156501340", "textDisplay": "...mmnnnn... ...British always trying to take away our guns.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12kevty0xmfvzmkv23ugfajkobku3fre04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClg88xwUGmAH9I2JTmGZVLA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xQlxGhtYl3M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJME/_dYpGaWaJrw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jeffrey Ramsey (J.R.)", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-09T15:56:34.826Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UClg88xwUGmAH9I2JTmGZVLA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.34116999999999997, "formal_score": 45, "updatedAt": "2015-09-09T15:56:34.826Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101121259880054267952", "textDisplay": "Piers Morgan Gets Fired or CNN cancels the show, but it didn't happen in \nthis video like the title reads, Maybe I misread it?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12hfhejvtjeyxo3o23ovxgprlzhjrign04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrMSkpf_F6ISRfbLRKjULmQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IY6xPOBFpIk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANk/WvKI9SeeKj8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Hezron Fekitoa", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-11T16:48:39.126Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrMSkpf_F6ISRfbLRKjULmQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.8463138, "formal_score": 58, "updatedAt": "2015-04-11T16:48:39.126Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104992191993573005551", "textDisplay": "The first step to creating a tyranny is disarming the masses. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z125il24pneagdpm422wt33jrxvucr004": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 19, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9GbC8CQKo-t4ehkeB903Zg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n0ke89uhKfE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARo/mEyRNLd8b5I/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Black Sambo", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-07T14:01:23.309Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9GbC8CQKo-t4ehkeB903Zg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.45744000000000001, "formal_score": 95, "updatedAt": "2015-10-07T14:01:23.309Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110181984314309342946", "textDisplay": "A foreigner will never understand american values.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPjRv5Svc5NW52HE1JMyNA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "stonem001", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125il24pneagdpm422wt33jrxvucr004", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-09T09:55:00.334Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXPjRv5Svc5NW52HE1JMyNA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.93599379999999999, "formal_score": 24, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-09T09:55:00.334Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JYKdhmgeRv8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADM/eKAwYJNQXzc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112263649845321447506", "textDisplay": "+Black Sambo you're welcome to keep them.

Neither Republican, Democrat, or Independent should be \nallowed to change the Constitution without following the steps that our \nlaws provide for, period.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z120vdsprmnnezsti22oun1proiatfqcu": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChwy75UB0NHwOf0XEy2weXg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oXtSOToMXO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEM/EeIjhmoIX58/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Wray Coal", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-19T04:03:39.092Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UChwy75UB0NHwOf0XEy2weXg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9158440000000001, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2015-05-19T04:03:39.092Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109459196942340481548", "textDisplay": "Report anybody who doesn't allow responses as a spammer.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChwy75UB0NHwOf0XEy2weXg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Wray Coal", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z120vdsprmnnezsti22oun1proiatfqcu", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-19T04:06:10.395Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UChwy75UB0NHwOf0XEy2weXg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.59310400000000008, "formal_score": 14, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-19T04:06:10.395Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oXtSOToMXO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEM/EeIjhmoIX58/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109459196942340481548", "textDisplay": "+Wray Coal I just love it when somebody posts an idiotic comment while \nfeigning intelligence, yet doesn't allow responses because they know they \nwill be destroyed!"}}]}, "z125fbhp3xebstjsp23ocxda2k3hs5nsa": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpPwU6ZUX31dyp5h4giFzVQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 13.333333333333334, "authorDisplayName": "p Buck", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-10T22:48:24.004Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCpPwU6ZUX31dyp5h4giFzVQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.93570989999999998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-09-10T22:48:24.004Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114966915550376008821", "textDisplay": "sandy hook was fake,piers you dumb ass.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ajzcgzyfqxt4zy04cdnrqaqzzw1x54do": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvlifQVCG7skV7a9A2SadQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-68sELlFQhZk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/4Bye7pun5Og/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mark Allen", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-26T05:50:43.324Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHvlifQVCG7skV7a9A2SadQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.029474, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-26T05:50:43.324Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100394300855784980895", "textDisplay": "How many times this Pierce guy ask the same questions over and over and \nover is basically annoying.

I never said that the 2nd amendment says \nmuskets. I said that the 2nd amendment was written hundreds of years when \nall they had was muskets. Your inability to read things correctly led you \nto write a block of redundant text that is still making my eyes hurt. \n\nI wish you were as familiar with the meaning of the word \"amendment\" as you \nare with the word \"armament\". It's probably very confusing for you, since \nthe two words are so similar. Since you completely missed the point of my \ncomment by getting stuck on the word \"armament\", I'll try to help you out a \nlittle bit.\n\nAn amendment means \"a change in a document\". See... by the very definition \nof the word, we could change the constitution if the time calls for it. The \noriginal Constitution has been changed SEVENTEEN (17) times, so do me a \nfavor and save all of that \"Founding Fathers worded the Constitution to \nlast throughout the ages\" crap. B.S. - it was written by the Founding \nFathers, not freaking Nostradamus.\n\nPeople like you like guns because they are cool. Period. So stop screaming \n\"2nd Amendment 2nd Amendment\". You don't give a crap about that \namendment... Call it like it is, you love guns, and you don't want anyone \nto take them away. Period.\n\nConservatives kill me. God forbid someone messes with your precious second \namendment right to make love to your guns. You are quick to yell \"Those are \nmy goddamn constitutional rights\". But you quickly forget about those \nconstitutional rights when you rally to abolish the 14th amendment (the one \nthat grants citizenship to all people born in the United States). But \nthat's a whole different conversation...\n\nI'll give you the flip side. I live in NYC. Here in NY, it's a long process \nfor a citizen to own a gun. The problem is that gun violence in NY happens \nwith guns purchased in those states where its easy to get guns. They buys \nthem in rural gun'ho states, and bring them to the urban city to sell to \ncriminals for profit.\n\nThis weekend Governor Cuomo's attorney was killed by a gun that came from \noutside of New York. He was standing there in the middle of a parade, and a \ngunfight between gangs ensued. He was killed by a stray bullet. You may or \nmay not have heard about that. This happens quite often in NYC and in other \nurban areas. So often that it's not even newsworthy anymore, with many \ndeaths to stray bullets only getting a line or two deep inside the \nnewspapers. Rarely do they make national headlines.\n\nBut it happens so often that it's gotten to the point where we are not safe \nfrom stray bullets in any urban areas anymore. Anyone here and in other \nurban areas can die to random gun violence at anytime. I could happen in a \nmall, a theater, in a restaurant, sitting in your car, or even sitting at \nyour desk at work. People in urban areas LIVE with this fact every single \nday.\n\nSo what's the solution? How do you propose we save your grandmother from \ngetting shot on the way to buying groceries? Give everyone more guns to \ndeter the bad guys?\n\nHow do you propose we save your girl from getting mowed down by a stray \nbullet while shopping for shoes at the mall? Circulate more than the \n310,000,000 guns that are already out there in the U.S.?\n\nDon't tell me that giving citizens more guns will deter criminals. YOU \nCANNOT DETER A STRAY BULLET. All that really does is give people the \nability to RETALIATE. That's it. And quite frankly, I'm not interested in \nthat. \n\nMe owning a gun is not going to help very much when our kids get innocently \nmowed down by strays bullet on their way to school, is it? Civilized folks \nunderstand that these things should not happen in a civilized society. \nPeriod."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChVLOlw6KrR3fVsAaAQFU0g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ninjaplz85", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13wtfgrosb2vfbuq23dcx5xgqypwp3to", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-08T05:34:06.356Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UChVLOlw6KrR3fVsAaAQFU0g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.78827000000000003, "formal_score": 44, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-08T05:34:06.356Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-41UKLVQ1nMU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/YRhd_gHyzGU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116419101558711816267", "textDisplay": "+Mario R It says \"arms\" not \"muskets.\" The Founding Fathers worded the \nConstitution to last throughout the ages.

It happens.  Me personally, I would \nrather get shot in the head by someone than get stabbed in the kidney and \nwrithe in pain for a few hours before I die anyway...but das jus me doe!  \nBut seriously, the point of the right to keep and bear arms is the \nprotection of the people from tyranny.  Any concessions to this right is an \ninequitable loophole through which tyranny can undermine the right \nand weaken the defense of the public to resist that tyranny.  It is a \nslightly alarmist position, but also a necessary one.  It was not that long \nago that Germany removed the guns from the people and attempted to lock the \nworld in their fascist goose step.  Throughout history those seeking power \nhave removed the weapons of the masses to ease their efforts at \ndomination.  Entire martial arts were invented to counteract these \npractices, but now we live in the age of the firearm.  For those confused \nabout the wording of the amendment, it refers to the militia AND to the \nright to bear firearms.  They are not fully tied together and nor are they \nfully separate concepts; but to call the police or the military what is \nmeant by them miss the point of stopping tyranny.  Police and Military are \nagents of the Government; and while members of those organizations will \nturn and stand with the people, the people must also have the means to \nstand alone should that be required. \n\nAll of that being said, I am for certain checks being made before the \npurchase of a weapon.  Although, a mental health check is not necessarily \none of them.

To argue from the perspective that it's \"every man's \nright\" or whatever, is to not really think about it hard enough.\nOn the other hand USA is full of people who are indoctrinated to believe \nthat having a gun is a good thing, so me arguing my point here is de facto \npointless.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13tetjqfkj3jky0kvebgbshjy3qsymk": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3XjwndoJPxOLzdJOUP1uw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-STC5tmaSnmE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApk/fYiom2znlvI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "jemigs tolentino", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-05T02:57:06.888Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCb3XjwndoJPxOLzdJOUP1uw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.023795999999999984, "formal_score": 95, "updatedAt": "2015-06-05T02:57:06.888Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108667250750563972825", "textDisplay": ".i believe in responsible gun ownership as what piers is saying...the \nproblem with america is so much rights on everything, life liberty etc..and \nwhen a shooting happens they blame the shooter as mentally insane, \nschizophrenic or lunatic. then the whole country mourns. the point is when \nwe get a drivers license, people go to a lot of test as regulations that a \nperson is able to drive without harming people or property,when it comes to \ngums, you can hoard as many as you want....i hope they encounter a whack \ndoctor doing surgery on this guy..because its american rights to play \ndoctor as well!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13rs1wwyk3ydhu5g04ccngy5u2uwl2bjpk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpRbTjVhshYWR7ITpTG0qKQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XUZycPcc89A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/moE3hugYC8w/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "derek costello", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-28T09:56:09.350Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCpRbTjVhshYWR7ITpTG0qKQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.59189399999999992, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-01-28T09:56:09.350Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116067071708522123843", "textDisplay": "Unfortunately Mr Morgan was far more interested in his questions, than the \nanswers.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12osbxgmnn4fb4lj23hc3hhnxvwwbnde": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3TvypSgTUi8tqMXJ_IcH2w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-r2lyWj3RcLw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASM/Z755BGpmL7Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 9.5238095238095237, "authorDisplayName": "sailure1", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-24T23:36:30.981Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3TvypSgTUi8tqMXJ_IcH2w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.98786240000000003, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-05-24T23:36:30.981Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100599666234035163658", "textDisplay": "fucking liar bs, this clip is just him being a jackass\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13yddhwrpqvz5uto22wgfsabnjei11de": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy723MpiEeqZIYZl75iJhrw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Q-_eCp8muT4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABw/AFtixLvQwxM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 6.8965517241379306, "authorDisplayName": "Edward G", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-27T16:23:37.630Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCy723MpiEeqZIYZl75iJhrw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.79041800000000006, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-04-27T16:23:37.630Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115226925602403777406", "textDisplay": "What asshole Morgan got back to the Queen and sit on her face.

Mexico itself has already had Piers \nMorgan's dream ban on guns for decades, and now *because of* that, when you \ngo outside over there in a lot of areas (especially Northern Mexico) you \npractically have to do the bullet-dodge dance like Neo in the Matrix to \navoid getting hit. Why? It is because criminals don't give a damn about gun \nlaws or any other laws, they can get guns and ammo originating in all kinds \nof places including North Korea (a major supplier of counterfit guns) and \ntheir own personal workshops, the police cannot detect most of the guns or \nammo being smuggled for practical reasons, law-abiding citizens really have \nno way to protect themselves, and cops have a habit of showing up late to \nthe party when everybody else has already gone home. That is why the drug \ncartels have practically taken over Northern Mexico, and a lot of local \npolice departments have declared unofficial surrenders to and alliances \nwith major drug gangs. The ban on gun ownership has turned Mexico into a \nreal gangster's paradise. (The only real green zones in Mexico now are the \nareas where whole towns gave the government and all its police and military \nforces the finger, and regular citizens armed themselves with all the guns \nand ammo that they could find and formed what they call \"autodefensas\" \nmeaning \"self-defense forces\" to protect themselves.) The government here \ncannot even stop children from buying a regular supply of illegal drugs, \nand it thinks that it can stop career criminals and well-connected gang \nmembers from buying any guns and ammo? That is a monument of extreme \ngovernment stupidity. It is purely idiotic and perfectly delusional. Mexico \ntoo is right across the border. The same kinds of things that are happening \nover there will just spread into this country, starting with the growth of \nMexican drug gangs in the U.S. using hoodlum U.S. citizens as recruits. The \nonly thing that supposed gun control laws will succeed in doing in the U.S. \nis diverting more tax money and borrowed money to the morons and lunatics \nin the so-called Department of Homeland Security and the businesses that it \nkeeps contracting out more and more stuff to.\n\nBanning supposedly mentally insane people from getting guns too is just a \nrotten underhanded political trick. The criteria for declaring people as \nbeing mentally ill includes declaring people as being delusionally paranoid \nschizophrenics merely for the allegedly outrageous, radical, and dangerous \n\"anti-American\" claim that the U.S. government and many of its affiliates \nare corrupt (No!!! Really???) and has had crooked members involved in \ncriminal activity (as if working in or with the government always \nautomatically turned every person into a saint). That is even if you are \njust reiterating the conclusions of forensics experts and whistleblowers \n(including Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning) who have concrete undeniable \nevidence and proof and pretty much all agree that government officials were \nclearly involved in the committing of the alleged crimes. Thus, labeling \nsomebody as being mentally insane has really become just another way of \naccusing somebody of being a (significant) political dissident. That is why \nso many gun rights advocates adamantly reject the government's arguments \nconcerning guns and alleged mental illness. It's all a trick and a scam.\n\nIf everybody has a gun, and some crazy jerk decides to pull out a gun \nbecause he wants to \"smoke\" somebody else, then everybody around this jerk \ncan pull out their own guns and quickly teach him some manners. A lot of \ngovernment officials and well-connected oligarchs have a problem with this, \nbeing that they themselves are crazy jerks, and that is why they have a \nproblem with everybody having a gun. That too is why we were given the \nall-important Second Ammendment right after the critically important First \nAmendment. It is meant to keep *all* jerks in their proper place.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13rinsycyucg3se123yhpnaqwjjwd0dj": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR01Dss5thp-hzUG1-1N4NA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VG1mi0EEwCc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/0O_lwggLUSU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Brazillianize", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-04T19:52:19.360Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCR01Dss5thp-hzUG1-1N4NA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.80054040000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-01-04T19:52:19.360Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114050090720483850995", "textDisplay": "Where the f**k in this clip is this guy fired ???

You do understand that humanity hasn't evolved since we lived in \ncaves and that still to this day governments can go batshit crazy and still \nkill millions often even if it's just for profit.\n\nGiven that our government is as corrupt as they can get away with and not \nat all run by we the people, how is it that you assume the polpulace can \nafford to be defenseless against tyranny? We commit tyranny on other \nnations constantly, why do you assume that could never be turned around on \nwe the people when trillions of dollars are at stake and when that old \nsaying is still true that absolute power corrupts absolutely?\n\nI'm not crazy paranoid about this stuff, but I am an atheist and a realist \nand the reality is we have a government that on many levels simply cannot \nbe trusted. We are ruled by a two party dictatorship which gives the \nillusion of freedom, and our government is nowhere close to the ideal set \nforth at our nations founding.\n\nIt's a shame we have a system which still reinforces mass delusion through \nreligion, which still manipulates the masses for the gain of the wealthy, \nand it's a shame we can't trust people yet but that's just a reality of \nbiology and mans current state of evolution. There are still psychopaths in \nthis world and they seek out power, there are still people made \npsychopathic by religions who become leaders of nations such as GWB.\n\nYou can not fully trust humans until we are further evolved.\n\nThe right to bear arms is there for good reason, and it's as relevant today \nas it was back then.\n\nIf you want to reduce gun violence and violence in general you need to \naddress the issues above which drive people crazy and make them feel \nhopeless, and make them feel like slaves with little to no say.\n\nWe live in a country that is still competitive at it's heart rather than \ncooperative, which is still as corrupt as ever and still serving it's own \ninterests not ours. When suicides go up, rather than making our nation \nbetter and more cooperative and supportive and fixing the things that are \nwrong and evil we put up chain link fences on bridges and overpasses to \nmake suicide move somewhere else.\n\nFix the real issues and watch gun violence disappear.

Going by your \ntheory, they end up filing and paying taxes in FOUR countries unless they \nrenounce citizenship every time they moves. That will be ten thousand \nDollars at US rates.\n\nDon't you see the madness of what you are suggesting?\n\nIt would seem that you just want to make sure that a few  rich people are \nactually still living in the country cannot avoid taxes, and if millions \nwho actually left (roughly 7 million) end up paying taxes to a country they \nactually left, well that's the price.\n\nAgain, the USA was founded on fighting such unjust taxes by a country they \nleft.\n\nBy the way, the definition of a slave also includes slaves who could buy \ntheir own freedom as Americans can, but they are nonetheless, slaves."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC72vURCiEdHVS3tHLGkkniQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Alex K\u00f6nig", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13fivvpfxrmttl5n04cghqaytjhztdyg14", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-24T23:39:00.991Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC72vURCiEdHVS3tHLGkkniQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.53049600000000008, "formal_score": 59, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-24T23:42:00.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115912193076769355992", "textDisplay": "+Mike Breen You are right.

In addition to voting for a representative such \nas a Member of Parliament or a Senator a citizen may sometimes be asked to \nvote on a single question such as Gay Marriage.

That is quite \nunusual for Britain.\n\nAgain I would not pursue the question but I have heard American kids say \nthe USA is not a democracy it is a republic.

And hey maybe I'm wrong, but I'm assuming \nsince Piers Morgan supports gun control, and wants more gun regulations, \nthe only reason he'd be highlighting \"well regulated militia\" is he \nbelieves it supports his view of more gun regulations. This is my \nunderstanding from paying attention to the way he constructed his argument. \nBut still, while I may not *know* exactly what *he* is thinking, what I do \nknow is that it's a common belief among gun control advocates, so I'm just \nguessing that he (since he wants gun control) is thinking the same thing. \nCall me crazy, but it seems like someone who supports gun control would \nhave common views of (shockingly) those who support gun control.\n\nHe never actually made Piers fully contradict himself. He tried, but he \nfailed, for the most part. Piers never said he wanted the \"militia\" to have \nguns, he specifically said \"I'm fine with the military or the police in any \ncountry having weapons.\" (8:55)\nThe senator never got him to specifically agree to \"militia members\", Piers \nspecified \"police and military\" every time, instead of just saying \"yes I \nbelieve militia member should have weapons\". So the senator had a very weak \npoint. You could tell he was trying, though.\n\nIf the senator was really as smart as you act like he is, he should just \nget straight to making his point and knock down the questions Piers Morgan \nthrows at him with strong and precise answers. But he doesn't, and just \nbeats around the bush instead. He *still* never addressed the \"well \nregulated militia\" question. I know how arguments work, you could tell he \nwas purposely trying to delay certain parts while he thought of what to say \n(if you pay attention to the video, that is) and change the topic at \ncertain times as well.\n\nAnd well that's sad, if you want me to get you some more crayons and \nconstruction paper I can... don't want you getting bored or anything.\n\nI dunno if that last bit is supposed to impress me, or if I should care at \nall, but honestly degrees mean nothing to me and in no way define how smart \nyou are.

Murder is wrong, \nthat's just a simple truth. But guns are not the only weapons used to \ncommit murder. Now, other than physical parts of the murderer's body \n(hands, feet, etc.) these weapons are on their own inanimate. They don't \nmake decisions, they are just used by their handler, who makes the \ndecisions. So, this debate is in the wrong place. Weapons will \nunfortunately always be available (like I said earlier, we're born with a \nfew), so the issue lies with the people. There is only one thing that can \nfix man's sin nature, and that is Jesus Christ. We will never be perfect as \nlong as we live on Earth, and neither will the institutions we create.

Illegal guns are really rare in my \ncountry. In fact, which is very little known, there are MILLIONS of legal \nhandguns and rifles in the hands of private citizens, we have shooters \nranges in almost every small city etc. You know how often our police needs \nto draw their duty weapons, let alone fire it ? We had 484 deadly \nshootings, and 2406 cases, where the police had to shoot at people. Not per \nyear, no, in OVER SIX DECADES, from 1952 till 2013. You have cities, where \nyou get larger numbers in a year, and we are talking about a whole country \nover 6 decades. How many people die here anyway ? Well 2011 431 people died \nthrough grave bodily harm, murder etc. Again I believe you have cities that \nare worse off then our whole country. AGAIN, we have MILLIONS of guns in my \ncountry, so it is not like could not shoot each other if they wanted to, \nbut thanks to strict laws, allmost all guns are in the hands of legal \nowners. Law abiding citizens, who do not shoot people.\nSo there is one thing Americans finally need to realize : that harder \nweapons laws would be no problem for criminals, and lead to private \ncitizens not having guns to defend themselves, while all gangsters are \narmed, is the biggest lie the American Gun Lobby, especially the NRA, is \ntelling you !!! Stricter gun laws protect private citizens, not endanger \nthem.\n\n\nSTOP BELIEVING THEIR BULLSHIT OUT OF FEAR, ALL THE FACTS SHOW THEY LIE TO \nYOUR FACE WITH EVERY SINGLE ARGUMENT THEY MAKE AGAINST STRICTER GUN LAWS\n\n\nThe gun lobby in America is playing a deadly game with you out of pure \ngreed. They want to sell more arms, and do not give a flying fuck about \nyour safety !!! For the Brady campaign people where trying to get exact how \nmany numbers are killed by guns each year, where they are killed etc. Wanna \nknow something interesting ? You can easily get numbers on everything, but \nnot on that. For some reason the last reliable statistics are from 2006, \nanything since then is burried i.n dozens of different documents, and you \nhave to go through countless bureaucratic hurdles, to get them, from the \ndifferent organizations like the ATF, the FBI etc. So they where collecting \nnumbers from everywhere, and finally started to realize why the bureaucrats \ndid not really want that numbers published. Only the killing sprees alone, \nduring which where at least 3 people killed each, where a fucking 64 pages \nlong document since 2006 !!! Can you imagine how  many shootings those \nwhere ???\n\n\nNow let me explain what you have to do in Germany to get a gun, like shoot \nit for sport. You do not really need it for defense, since our criminals do \nnot have guns, and our police for th e most part is quick to be there to \nhelp you. Basically you can get a weapon owner ship card. With that you can \nlegally buy a handgun or rifle, but you need an extensive background check \nto get it, and require a reason for the gun. Most simply say they fire for \nsports, and have to bring them some document that you are a member of a \nsport shooter association or club or what have you. However that ownership \ncard is NOT a right to carry a gun. If you transport it say from your home \nto your club, you need to transport it safely in a box, without ammunition \nand magazine, those need to be in a separate box. Both must be under lock \nand key.\nA right to actually carry one, is MUCH harder to get, and only if you have \na serious reason you will get one (say you are a policeman,a bodyguard, a \nperson, that requires special protection, something like that). So let us \nforget about that, and get back to the ownership card. With it you also \nneed to have a safe storage for your gun, meaning a safe class A is minimum \n(that is the lowest class of safes, not even a real safe. More like a \nlockbox, that is really strong, and has a good lock). However, should you \nhave a bigger collection, you also need a better safe, like clubs usually \nhave a special room with several safes. If you are part of a club, you \nusually store it at the club anyway. You can't really shoot it at home, so \nwhy transport it all the time ? So you can canoodle it at night ?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z134c33odxzsfry3e22asxibqlruedemr": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47SN6_2yvp-HfDzpME2YeQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3ZD7ZWANGRc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADM/N4IwUk4kZOw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ModernVikingSaga", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-26T07:54:42.798Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC47SN6_2yvp-HfDzpME2YeQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.55455600000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-01-26T07:54:42.798Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107029755756534456346", "textDisplay": "Piers loves his Loaded questions (no pun intended)\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z120wpco0yracvqvd23js1s45zzazdacr": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAx-J7xm5AQvRjUfH8p4PjQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lvphUJ3IEC4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHfM/nmscop5obUQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Engelbert Delrosario", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-24T06:36:13.028Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAx-J7xm5AQvRjUfH8p4PjQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.91216179999999991, "formal_score": 98, "updatedAt": "2015-09-24T06:36:13.028Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117641674808957741455", "textDisplay": "Can we please deport this DBAG ...DBAG = Piers\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z123h11phx2pwvsdt222yfl4yviczdd0c": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMXL5-ylqkAzRUHFvNp-G0Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VGQmTUUn2LA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACc/IZs91fCsFiI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.79681274900398402, "authorDisplayName": "Denver Starkey", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-10T17:41:10.742Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMXL5-ylqkAzRUHFvNp-G0Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.80193559999999997, "formal_score": 16, "updatedAt": "2015-09-10T17:58:15.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105311153081168339940", "textDisplay": "what these anti-gun nuts don't realize it's not so much about the guns \nthemselves , it's about our rights getting stamped on in loop hole laws , \ninstead of taking the real legal course to change that.  if they can just \ncircumvent the constitution  for gun laws , then where do they draw the \nline on what part of the constitution  they are willing to circumvent?   \nthe admendmants exist for a reason.

They abandoned the Catholic Church and built \ntheir religion on the Bible alone - putting too much emphasis on the Old \nTestament, which has many unchristian acts.\n\nChristianity got its start on a cross outside Jerusalem, and continued \ninside Roman stadiums and written defiance to the Roman Emperor. Anybody \nwho has not followed that example is not a Christian, though many call \nthemselves so because they spend an hour at a gathering on Sundays.\n\nBut the political/militant reality that is Islam in the Middle East, no \nmatter how you spin it, began by violent subjugation. Sure they were \njustified in fighting, and even in conquering. In converting? I don't think \nso.\n\nIn comparison, Christian missionaries rode with conquistadores who \nsubjugated Native Americans. Many began the first outcry for justice for \nthe Native Americans. Many went peacefully and were tortured by the \nNatives, and inspired them with their conviction.\nOn the secular side of things, North American settlers went to war with \nNative tribes and conquered them because it was also a situation of kill or \nbe killed - conquest was justified, just as it was for Mohammed when the \npolytheists fought him. They did not convert them. If there was an \ninjustice afterwards, it was that they assigned them a place to go live and \nforced them all onto it.\n\nSo while what you're saying makes sense, you are simply adhering to today's \npopular biases - prejudice against Europeans and Christians - and maybe \ndon't see the double standard. I will not get over the truth because there \nis nothing beyond it - I hope you don't either.\n\nDo I think it's okay to think you're better than someone and to think that \njustifies you treating them unfairly? Absolutely not. I am a Christian, and \nChristian principles, if not Christian practice, dictate that each person \nhas an equal, infinite dignity, and from that dignity arises rights.\nAs for the European Christians, they did not do what they did insofar as \nthey were Christians, but insofar as they were Europeans and flawed human \nbeings. How do I know this? Because race has no significance in \nChristianity(Jesus was Moabite-Jewish, the first Christians were Romans, \nGreeks, Jews, North Africans, and Indians), and for Europeans race, by \nnature of the categorization is significant, consisting of nearly \nhomogenous ethnicity - Germanic(plus Anglo-Saxon, Celt, and Latin).\nMuslims, however, did not conquer insofar as they were Arabs, and indeed \nmany of them are not - they are Persians and Syrians. They did it in accord \nwith their common cause - Islam.\n\nAll respect to you, to Islam, to Christianity, \nEuropeans, Missionaries, Native Americans, American settlers. We are what \nwe are and have done what we have done, and we are judged justly by \nuniversal principles of justice. But this wholesale condemnation of \nEuropean Christians and exoneration of Arab and Persian and African Muslims \nis not."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1kkxx_XpUSsqZzAGnMKPkQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "snarkleton26", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xdf1hivbcsb44y04cgz45umqxxdkbbfo", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-03T11:48:14.805Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1kkxx_XpUSsqZzAGnMKPkQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.43969199999999997, "formal_score": 63, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-03T11:48:14.805Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117114244841181424057", "textDisplay": "+H Daniel Get over it -- the Muslims in Spain were FAR more tolerant of \nJews than the Catholics who kicked both Muslims and Jews out of Spain.

And then there is also how \nChristians used religion to force Native Americans to convert -- brutally \nand without mercy, often taking them from their families all in the name of \n\"saving\" them.

Let's \njust say that I want a coffee machine not because it is essential to make \ncoffee, but because I want one. Guess which one is okay and which one isn't.\n\nIf you are a gun owner in Australia, you are subject to the whim of those \nwho know nothing and do not care for your needs or interests; rather, they \nsimply wish to pursue their own agenda at your expense. Compare that \nsituation to that of an un-vaccinated child with parents who do not believe \nthat their child needs inoculation. In both cases, on contact with the real \nworld there is a very real chance that the victim (yes, victim) may die \nbecause of the choices that others made on his/her behalf.\n\nStraying from immediate death and destruction for a moment, there is one \nthing I would like to address that maybe you and I can both agree on. This \nis how I would have formed the 1996 National Firearms Agreement...with the \nconsultation of the shooting community. I agree with a lot of the laws, but \nat the same time I disagree with quite a few, mainly because they make no \nsense.\n\nMagazine capacity laws, importation laws, the \"looks like a military gun\" \nlaw, those 28 day waiting periods, the panic over pump action shotguns, \nsuppressor laws, the \"can be converted to full auto\" law, and the whole \nfirearm dealer brokering laws.\n\nI own a bolt action rifle, what does it matter if it holds 10 rounds or 11? \nThe importation laws just jack up prices here in Australia, and yet people \nare allowed to complain when movies cost more. A gun looking like something \nthat it isn't, is not the fault of the gun, it is the fault of the \nignoramus misidentifying it. 28 days waiting won't kill you, but by the \nsame token you shouldn't have to wait that long either. A pump shotgun \nshoots just as slow as a lever action or a bolt action, the panic over pump \nshotguns is because they do the scary \"click click\" that people see in \nmovies; not our fault, your ignorance. Suppressors mean that you don't \ndisturb your neighbours when you're shooting and you also don't disturb all \nthe wildlife you're trying to shoot either, they're just good for \neverybody, your ears especially. Just about any gun can be converted to \nfull auto, just because it can, doesn't mean it will, and you're hardly \ngoing to go to a public range with an illegally converted machinegun. The \nfirearm brokering laws are just painful, read up on them and try and find \nsome empathy in that big black soulless vacuum you have in your heart for \nthe poor gun owners.\n\nAt this rate I might as well have typed out War and Peace, I'll shut up now."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwCDgyZYsNoyqzb7sX1kjOA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "charlesian2000", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12jdzi4tzv0fdaoy04cgzjpyxq4tvgpa0w", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-18T11:24:04.803Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwCDgyZYsNoyqzb7sX1kjOA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.23814399999999997, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-18T11:24:04.803Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RvNRZhz2gh4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/8XUP2LIV_lI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111191394450788182805", "textDisplay": "+Nick Galbraith\n\nYou've actually nailed it Nick, if people want a gun in Australia, due to \nthe current laws and legislations, you have to do what it takes.\n\nIf you want a gun, the only person stopping you from owning a gun... is \nyou.

It was common for militias to \nengage guerrilla warfare or defense instead of attacking.\n\nFrom Wikipedia......Local militias were formed from the earliest English \ncolonization of the Americas in 1607. The first colony-wide militia was \nformed by Massachusetts in 1636 by merging small older local units, and \nseveral National Guard units can be traced back to this militia. The \nvarious colonial militias became state militias when the United States \nbecame independent. The title \"National Guard\" was used from 1824 by some \nNew York State militia units, named after the French National Guard in \nhonor of the Marquis de Lafayette. \"National Guard\" became a standard \nnationwide militia title in 1903, and specifically indicated reserve forces \nunder mixed state and federal control from 1933.\nFrom Wikipedia...........\nThe Second Amendment (Amendment II) to the United States Constitution \nprotects the right of the people to keep and bear arms and was adopted on \nDecember 15, 1791, as part of the first ten amendments contained in the \nBill of Rights.[1][2][3][4] The Supreme Court of the United States has \nruled that the right belongs to individuals,[5][6] while also ruling that \nthe right is not unlimited and does not prohibit all regulation of either \nfirearms or similar devices.[7] State and local governments are limited to \nthe same extent as the federal government from infringing this right per \nthe incorporation of the Bill of Rights.\nThe Second Amendment was based partially on the right to keep and bear arms \nin English common-law and was influenced by the English Bill of Rights of \n1689. Sir William Blackstone described this right as an auxiliary right, \nsupporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, \nand the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state.\n.....My point being that the  2nd amend was written before the National \nGuard  became a mainstream term..........which simply means that THE PEOPLE \n(CITIZENS) ARE...THE....MILITIA.....end of discussion.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13bfleadqiicrrzf04cgfxxiujcutjwb04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0oZdrisdhCB2yIhdOZsLLQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "aimeecurry46", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-24T22:27:32.695Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0oZdrisdhCB2yIhdOZsLLQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.94041180000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-02-24T22:27:32.695Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107945035630501235486", "textDisplay": "He does not get fired in this clip so the title is a bit misleading \nwouldn't you say.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12fwtfynkrnzjkmd23ltxfioqatipkxe04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 5, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7y6miGsiKOwHFAUUBj2p1w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GPSdW7T2mlw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARc/t0uuDtx7Y1g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Adam Bodford", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-25T03:23:08.332Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7y6miGsiKOwHFAUUBj2p1w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.73981199999999991, "formal_score": 76, "updatedAt": "2014-11-25T03:23:08.332Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110163792035331751970", "textDisplay": "Tough gun control has worked wonders for Brazil and Mexico.

Ironically not as dangerous by a single user \nas a pump action shotgun, which he is apparently okay with people having. \n\nYou see, it is you that are being dishonest, and without the ability to use \ndirty debate tactics like yelling over someone that is supposed to be a \nguest on your show will lose this conversation every time all things being \neven.\n\nI'd love to hear how you account for the fact that in the states that have \naccepted Stand Your Ground laws, justified shooting deaths have gone up, \nwhile overall homicides have decreased.

Everyone screaming \"2nd Amendment \n2nd Amendment\" if full of crap. You font give a crap about that \namendment... Call it like it is, you freaking like guns, and you don't want \nanyone to take them away.\n\nSomeone on here saying that states with high levels of gun control laws \nlike NY and NJ still have high crime rates, so therefore gun control does \nnot work. To whoever stated that, you need to understand two things: \n\n1. Learn this term: Cause and Effect. It's not \"they implemented strong gun \nregulations, and the result is high crime rates\". The correct order would \nbe \" They have high crime rates, and so they implemented stronger gun \nregulations\".\n\n2. Gun violence in NY, where I happen to be from, happens with guns \npurchased in those states where its easy to get guns. \n\nThe 2nd Amendment was supposed to give everyone the right to bear arms as a \nmeans of keeping the government in check. It was written at a time before \nhandguns were even invented (I think). The government had muskets lol. Well \nfolks, nowadays the government has stealth fighters, tanks, drones, nukes, \nand cyber warfare. Your precious gun isn't going to keep anyone in check \nany longer.\n\nThe 2nd Amendment has long outlived its usefulness. So please stop \nscreaming about your 2nd Amendment and just admit the truth - that you \nthink guns are awesome and you don't want anyone to take them away."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuC0KD0go0XNS9xz4340yIQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bobby Brown", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12lddliizmailis122fsp5otm3qzziva", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-03T23:00:57.107Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuC0KD0go0XNS9xz4340yIQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.31054599999999999, "formal_score": 50, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-03T23:00:57.107Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IXKsgwql66Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/_UhPs-zoEak/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117164262079122581114", "textDisplay": "ben"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuC0KD0go0XNS9xz4340yIQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bobby Brown", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12lddliizmailis122fsp5otm3qzziva", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-03T23:00:40.866Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuC0KD0go0XNS9xz4340yIQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.53237800000000002, "formal_score": 12, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-03T23:00:40.866Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IXKsgwql66Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/_UhPs-zoEak/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117164262079122581114", "textDisplay": "not sure \nwhat this is"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8538ZNqAJLYLEdmv4TkunQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "jack benson", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12lddliizmailis122fsp5otm3qzziva", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-03T13:48:30.556Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8538ZNqAJLYLEdmv4TkunQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99625414999999995, "formal_score": 50, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-03T13:48:30.556Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dzYTT7lHzIA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC-M/MhDlLVeIF0A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110951072084000200407", "textDisplay": "+peptobismolsaves1 \nhttps://www.facebook.com/thepeoplesvoicetv/videos/434848976662549/?hc_location=ufi"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuC0KD0go0XNS9xz4340yIQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bobby Brown", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12lddliizmailis122fsp5otm3qzziva", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-03T00:46:13.964Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuC0KD0go0XNS9xz4340yIQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.27399400000000002, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-03T00:46:49.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IXKsgwql66Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/_UhPs-zoEak/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117164262079122581114", "textDisplay": "out of what??\nthats not a statistic\n\nhow many calls do they answer dave\n\n over a million?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoD-KBDN_TsTWxlCh3XOHhw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MrCoughupalung", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12lddliizmailis122fsp5otm3qzziva", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-02T02:24:00.496Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoD-KBDN_TsTWxlCh3XOHhw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.73908200000000002, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-02T02:24:00.496Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bsqKoNgsH1M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/gWIHsZFn6lI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106497591637892713712", "textDisplay": "+david liddle Not true.

The USA is a nation of paranoid people willing \nto shoot anyone who is suspicious and asking questions later.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12pxtlpwoigxfjo504cghpahmiesfuel": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZIZsNWi7YFuQu6_d9cMeFg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Houdinii1212", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-18T21:14:43.877Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZIZsNWi7YFuQu6_d9cMeFg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.77807599999999999, "formal_score": 83, "updatedAt": "2015-01-18T21:14:43.877Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110056407723467163116", "textDisplay": "you must all remember that when the 2nd amendment was written a musket was \na military style and military issued firearm.\n\nrights do not change just because technology advances. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ahv44br3xtre5s04cj5rbttqtxn04sw40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9PlG6d6N1Fyesz24mGMUQw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XIT-P_AzJj4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/K9xvWTydJtE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 4.3478260869565215, "authorDisplayName": "Brokenstatic44", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-12T03:12:55.492Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9PlG6d6N1Fyesz24mGMUQw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.38703799999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-09-12T03:12:55.492Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101681175857969291075", "textDisplay": "Mental health can deteriorate, assholes like Piers think everyone can be \ncatagorized.

Also, my worries on that are \nthat people have different opinions on when lethal force is required... \nCarry a glock, if someone comes calling with a weapon, put two through the \nchest and one in the head, better him than you...\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z122vbnypwijvpg5z04cgtdgwuizdhfxxdg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNQ-L_oHSg_0SFjDK-sreZw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Daniel Schtudiner", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-03T00:37:57.960Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNQ-L_oHSg_0SFjDK-sreZw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.23904600000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-09-03T00:37:57.960Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115361654972373202152", "textDisplay": "the guy is so cool!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12rwzpgwvanxpl2l23cynypuwaafjrgz04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Be318f-OVnuzkf_eI09Lg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1iHY82Wn3hg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABQ/a8jIuaedY8g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "AnadunePictures", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-29T16:31:42.479Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6Be318f-OVnuzkf_eI09Lg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.085938000000000014, "formal_score": 76, "updatedAt": "2014-11-29T16:31:42.479Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104842286588548008349", "textDisplay": "No No No No Please do not send Piers Morgan back to Britain.

Some enjoy this. \nOthers do not. Not everyone uses it. Not everyone wants to or feels \ncompelled to. We also have the Right to Bear Arms. It's treated with \nlargely the same respects as the aforementioned Freedom of Speech. Now, the \npeople complaining about the Right to Bear Arms, could not complain about \nit if someone had taken their Right to Freedom of Speech. Since some people \ndon't want to have to argue with others, should we shed our Freedom of \nSpeech?\n\n     Basically, people in America can have this debate because our Founding \nFathers had the sense to realize that you don't just read the US \nConstitution Amendment by Amendment, it should to some degree perpetuate \nitself. We The People are in charge of protecting that document, so that it \nmay protect us in turn. Sometimes another person is going to violate \nanother person. The reasons can range widely. If you assume that in large, \npeople as a whole are good and don't truly want to harm others, why then \nwould anyone suggest disarming the good and law abiding citizens who've \ndone nothing wrong should now yield their Right to Bear Arms because a few \nbad people misused their rights?\n\n     This is why justice systems exist. However, it's rare that a policeman \nis just a few feet from your door when an armed assailant is breaking into, \nor has already broken into your home/car/business. Or muggers on the \nstreet. And so on. All of these people are either just rotten or they have \nmental illnesses. Sometimes they're the result of what happens to a good \nperson when they are forced to take extraordinary means for their own \nsurvival in a nation that makes all law abiding, tax paying citizens \npurchase a variety of \"tiered\" medical insurance packages (if they don't \nhave them already, or those within the poverty guidelines can qualify for \nfree services (which I do admit is a step in the right direction)).\n\n     This is the United States of America. And we most definitely have \nproblems. And we most certainly will not get solutions from our current \nleadership. But all that aside, we do have our constitution. Both the \ndocument and as Americans. And all of us who love this country would stand \nto fight against any invader. I've noticed this fact explained before. As \nany invading force would have military, civil protection (police/etc.), \nmilitia(s), and citizens themselves (likely forming into militia's) if \nthings got desperate. So simply from an overall safety standpoint, it's \nwise to arm the populous, even with modern weaponry and everything \nenhancing it being wielded by the military.\n\n    Should the average person be allowed to purchase rifles, shotguns, \nmachine guns, etc., if they're following the laws? Yes. Should I be able to \nsay that? Yes. Should people be able to agree with me? Yes. Should people \nbe able to disagree with me and generally make jokes about how I'm a \ngun-toting lunatic? Yes. Should they be able to carry guns? Yes. Do they \nhave to? No. Do I have to carry my guns in public? Occasionally. Will I \ngive up my right to have guns or allow them to be regulated if I'm \nfollowing the law? No. Why not? I'm not a criminal. I've done nothing \nwrong. I've never turned my gun on another human being and I've never taken \na human life. I do not deserve to be treated like a criminal while I've \nbeen following the law the entire time.\n\n     So my fellow Americans, while I may not agree with what some of you \nhave to say, and I know some of you won't agree with what I've said. If I \nhad to use my gun (think severely extreme circumstances i.e. revolution) to \nprotect your right to disagree with me and curse me out about it, I would \ndo it. Even if you didn't appreciate it, I would do it. We all have to die \nsome day, my friends. Some of us will die defending what we love. Some of \nus will die in comfort with loved ones. Some will die alone, and others \nstill will simply go missing. We can't always choose how or why we die. But \nwe can choose what we try to leave behind when we do die. I want to leave \nbehind a nation my kids can grow up in and be happy in. I don't want them \nto \"have\" to carry guns, but I want them to be able to if they want or need \nto. I want my kids to live in a nation where they can challenge the system \nand stand for what they believe in, even if it's completely against my own \nbeliefs. I'll be proud because they are voicing their opinions and ideas, \nand I'll know that there's an enormous number of people who have laid down \ntheir lives for them to be able to do that.\n\n     The Constitution wasn't simply written to be read one amendment at a \ntime. The Constitution was not written to be rigid and inflexible either, \nthat's why amendments are possible. The Constitution and its amendments \nwere not written just for our forefathers either. They were written for \ntheir children, and their children's children, right on down the line right \nup until now. And we, as Americans, have a duty to provide OUR children, \nand their children, their children's children, right on down the line as \nfar as the Story of Humanity can go, with the liberties and the choices \nthat we've been gifted. And they deserve to have the opportunity to do with \nthem as they will. Because this is America. And \"For the land and the home \nof the brave.\" just doesn't have the same ring to it.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ygrg51maytbx2h23vwp0yqyvoe5lyf04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSzt0_AlOM_vRGlIl9rFxg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LV0IjVK4IKE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEk/rN47IzqxA9s/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Sean Gannon", "isDirected": 1, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-24T00:31:54.687Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCzSzt0_AlOM_vRGlIl9rFxg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.20647600000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-05-24T00:31:54.687Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107914061708865095503", "textDisplay": "+ben-t  Go back in your hole troll\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13egbtionngxjm2j23idtoylo3bwnb3j": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzm2eUX12lsMMtAjVuZzVww", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MrOphachew", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-29T22:27:43.376Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCzm2eUX12lsMMtAjVuZzVww"}, "sentiment_score": -0.76372799999999996, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-01-29T22:27:43.376Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112057532352501631304", "textDisplay": "Piers Morgan is left-wing liberal socialists that hates America.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13asvq40ritdxasl22ryrbjen2bz5fo104": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ZU04aXlb5PKPS2Mu9hJdw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-w0cTcNi_XV4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC4/iII2YA3Bhg0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 5.882352941176471, "authorDisplayName": "vamanij tremblendab", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-01T13:12:22.578Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3ZU04aXlb5PKPS2Mu9hJdw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.42793799999999999, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-12-01T13:12:22.578Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112969818653693294178", "textDisplay": "GO PIERS!

Um, I'm sorry, but here is a bit of a \nnews flash for you. People have been killing each other since the beginning \nof time with their hands alone. Taking guns away will not stop people from \nkilling one another. Also, I'm a little tired of every time someone puts up \nnews stories about someone getting killed they only focus on the gun \nstories. Do you people realize how many people are beaten to death? \n\nAlso, to those of you who might say, \"What are you so scared of? We live \nwith no guns and are just fine.\" One, that's great for you. You have a \ngreat life and live it as long as you can, because you only get one. \nSecond, Yes, we have police. Yes, they are Supposed to protect us. While \nmost of them do so, there have been far to many situations where the police \nhave been in the wrong or have been corrupt. We are scared and have the \nRight to be able to protect ourselves.\n\nAnother thing... To those of you saying the senator is avoiding the \nquestion, no he is not. He is trying to say that both are equally as \nimportant. If we have the right to life then we damn sure have the right to \nprotect ourselves. I am not, Will not give up my right to protect myself \nbecause You had an unfortunate accident that ended in the loss of someone \nclose to you. You might be asking, \"How do I keep that from happening \nagain?\" One simple answer. Buy a gun. Next time you will be able to protect \nyourself and your loved ones.\n\nTaking away guns isn't going to fix anything. Take those away and people \nwill stab each other. Take away the knives and people will beat each other \nlike they have done for thousands of years.

The mental health issue is clearly a problem, but \nbecause of right to privacy laws in the United States, a person's mental \nhealth status cannot be identified and will not be identifiable.  There's a \nquestion on applications regarding mental health (ie \"Have you ever been \ninvoluntarily committed to a psychiatric facility or hospital due to mental \nillness\").  If the applicant elects to lie and answer \"no,\" no one can or \nwill be able to do anything about it.\n\nPiers Morgan says he wants licensing.  There is licensing in place (or at \nleast registration, just like there is in the UK, by the way).  There have \nbeen numerous incidents of mentally ill and simply stupid people (like \nmembers of ISIS), who go about killing people with knives, clubs, gardening \nimplements, and bombs - to name a few.  There's a popular expression that \nsays \"Guns don't kill people, people with guns kill people.\"  The fact \nremains that it's easier to kill with a gun that it is with other weapons \n(except explosives).  That said, look at the headline running beneath this \nconversation as the argumentative Morgan continues ranting.  It tells the \nstory of a mentally ill young man who repeatedly stabbed his father - with \na knife, then killed himself - with a knife.\n\nThose intent upon homicide will do what it takes to kill, regardless of the \nmethod.  In the Sandy Hook and Colorado movie theater disasters, two \nmentally ill men go hold of weapons and used them to commit mass murder. \n The question begs, if the majority of audience members had, too, been \npermitted to carry concealed weapons, if the staff at the school had been \ntrained and licensed to carry concealed weapons, might the outcome have \nbeen different?

But, \nwhat would 1 bad guy do with a gun, if he was faced with 100 good guys that \nhad guns?\n\nThe Fore Fathers saw this as NECESSARY to the SECURITY of a FREE State. \n\nSo if you want to be \"Secure\" from crimes like Sandy Hook - you don't \ndisarm the public, instead you ARM the public (why? because it's their \nright).  \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12egjdackzgs5l2422kgf2yyznqstsbv04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOio3_l_unAUtfqGrOb2RLw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pYaWxw0l1Hc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABw/IuvO8up1-Jg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Airsoft Gamer", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-01T06:02:48.844Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOio3_l_unAUtfqGrOb2RLw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.040759999999999963, "formal_score": 18, "updatedAt": "2015-03-01T06:02:48.844Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106859185425833366073", "textDisplay": "I remember watching this live. Piers is so off base. He said I am\" clearly \nconfusing you \"but Piers is confused about the constitution. It has to be \namended to incorporate the ideas of mental health. We can't make state law \nthat changes the right to bare arms for anyone unless there is a \nconstitutional amendment. I doesn't matter if the senator or the 80% of \namericans agree with Piers, if the 80% don't amend the constitution then \nthe right to bare arms stands as is. Furthermore the intent of the right to \nbare arms was NOT so we could go hunting. It was another balance to the \nPOWER of government to protect against enemies foreign AND domestic. If a \ntyrannical unconstitutional government attempts to rule WE the PEOPLE then \nWE the PEOPLE have the right to secure our liberties as spelled out in the \nconstitution. In the 1780s when the constitution was ratified the weapons \ndid NOT include assault rifles, nor did it include F-16s. The intent of the \nconstitution as I have outlined here means that the constitution gives us \nthe \"well organized militia\" of the citizenry the right not just to bare a \nsword or flint rifle but also a tank and a stealth bomber!!!!!! We are not \nother countries. NO OTHER country in the HISTORY of the planet has done so \nmuch to advance humanity. So the WORLD should take a lesson from US. \nHowever we the US do really stupid things with our military and our \ncivilian police POWER corrupts and absolute POWER corrupts ABSOLUTELY. (YES \ndon't send me to fight a religious war-civil war on one side the when that \nside wins the other side we helped still hates us and would behead me just \nas quick as the other side. I mean REALLY JUST let those dumb farts kill \neach other and then if one side takes over the other then they want to \nfight us then BRING IT ON!!!!!!). That is why the government cannot be the \nONLY group with the POWER of ARMS. Give up your right to ARMS and hope you \nstill will have freedom is well just wishful thinking. In a perfect world \nthere are no wars. In a perfect world all people are perfect. So until then \n( and even not then) we should have the right to bare arms. This has \napparently been evidenced in history as the INDUS VALLEY kingdoms \napparently flourished for centuries without weapons. Then OOPs somebody \nwith arms did to them what people with arms do to people without arms. If \nyou don't learn from history why learn history? BECAUSE its neat stuff??? \nWell ok it is neat stuff but we should learn from history anyway. The \nfuture holds freedom of all mankind. Freedom to be you. Freedom to act as \nyou want so long as it doesn't injure others. So smoke 'em if you got 'em. \nDrink if you need it. Shoot up if your stupid.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12fvn04nxmzgzqk523utfvjqw2dineeh": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLjoZjRPzs1k7VMJzuSJ2KQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-M4u9jB2IaAc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/Zh4Q6a6hrv0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "NumbnutzTV", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-10T16:41:49.656Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLjoZjRPzs1k7VMJzuSJ2KQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.038013999999999992, "formal_score": 46, "updatedAt": "2015-03-10T16:41:49.656Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112793768214437538227", "textDisplay": "lol 'sin nature' phahaha this 'senator' is a total retard.I see nothing \nwrong with Morgan's points in this video, but i guess rednecks might find \nhis points offensive...\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13nypyrwq23cjgjr04cixej3ynru33x32c": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113420929296263858847", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kierkkegard", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-08T06:00:41.913Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "sentiment_score": 0.25368999999999997, "formal_score": 16, "updatedAt": "2014-11-08T06:00:41.913Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113420929296263858847", "textDisplay": "All the school shootings in the past three years have been staged by Obama.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13nhr1gayysxdzka22fdpvhrn3nhhdpl04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCREfwx2A1pUsaIwTsrfs_KA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "James O'Shea", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-06T20:05:31.654Z", "videoId": "4Oiw7CmmSbo", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCREfwx2A1pUsaIwTsrfs_KA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.80572579999999994, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-06T20:05:31.654Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115424499625654461583", "textDisplay": "Stupid video.
