There is not one \nverse in the Bible that condones slavery. Not to mention this verse you \nallude to, 1 peter 2:18, doesn\u2019t even say the word slavery.\n1 peter 2: 13-21\n13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether \nit be to the king, as supreme;\n14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment \nof evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.\n15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence \nthe ignorance of foolish men:\n16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as \nthe servants of God.\n17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.\n18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good \nand gentle, but also to the froward.\n19 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure \ngrief, suffering wrongfully.\n20 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall \ntake it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it \npatiently, this is acceptable with God.\n21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, \nleaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:\nNow here is the amplified (simplified version)\n1 peter 2:13-21\n13 Be submissive to every human institution and authority for the sake of \nthe Lord, whether it be to the emperor as supreme,\n14 Or to governors as sent by him to bring vengeance (punishment, justice) \nto those who do wrong and to encourage those who do good service.\n15 For it is God\u2019s will and intention that by doing right [your good and \nhonest lives] should silence (muzzle, gag) the ignorant charges and \nill-informed criticisms of foolish persons.\n16 [Live] as free people, [yet] without employing your freedom as a pretext \nfor wickedness; but [live at all times] as servants of God.\n17 Show respect for all men [treat them honorably]. Love the brotherhood \n(the Christian fraternity of which Christ is the Head). Reverence God. \nHonor the emperor.\n18 [You who are] household servants, be submissive to your masters with all \n[proper] respect, not only to those who are kind and considerate and \nreasonable, but also to those who are surly (overbearing, unjust, and \ncrooked).\n19 For one is regarded favorably (is approved, acceptable, and thankworthy) \nif, as in the sight of God, he endures the pain of unjust suffering.\n20 [After all] what [f]kind of glory [is there in it] if, when you do wrong \nand are punished for it, you take it patiently? But if you bear patiently \nwith suffering [which results] when you do right and that is undeserved, it \nis acceptable and pleasing to God.\n21 For even to this were you called [it is inseparable from your vocation]. \nFor Christ also suffered for you, leaving you [His personal] example, so \nthat you should follow in His footsteps.\nThis passage means don\u2019t rebel against the authority over you. If I may \necho the words of Christ \u201cGive unto Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s and unto God \nwhat is God\u2019s.\u201d  He said this to Israelites who were mad about taxes.  I \nguarantee you I can prove every passage you mentioned doesn\u2019t condone \nbeating, slavery, or adultery. Or for that matter, any wrong doing. God \nnever says slavery is ok or condones it. This is a pagan idea that was \nadopted by most of the world up till the 19th century and still exists \ntoday.\nExodus 21:16\n He who kidnaps a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, shall \nsurely be put to death.\nEphesians 6:5-9\n 5 Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the \nflesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ;\n 6 not with eyeservice, as men\u2013pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, \ndoing the will of God from the heart,\n 7 with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men,\n 8 knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from \nthe Lord, whether he is a slave or free.\n 9 And you, masters, do the same things to them, giving up threatening, \nknowing that your own Master also is in heaven, and there is no partiality \nwith Him.\nLeviticus 25\n 39 And if one of your brethren who dwells by you becomes poor, and sells \nhimself to you, you shall not compel him to serve as a slave.\n 40 As a hired servant and a sojourner he shall be with you, and shall \nserve you until the Year of Jubilee.\n 41 And then he shall depart from you\u2013\u2013he and his children with him\u2013\u2013and \nshall return to his own family.

Your 1st comment - \"...and it can be easily argued that carbon dating is \nboth inaccurate and unreliable.\"  \nTrue, it can. Unfortunately, this does not mean that these arguments are \nright. The decay rates observed across a multitude of radioactive isotopes \nhave been proven to be both accurate and reliable. The following 2 lists \nrepresent a small portion of known half-lifes for a number of radioactive \nisotopes:\nisotope         half-life (days)\nvanadium-48         15.9735     \ncalifornium-253     17.81     \nchromium-51         27.7025     \nmendelevium-258     51.5     \nberyllium-7         53.12     \ncalifornium-254     60.5     \ncobalt-56         77.27     \nscandium-46         83.79     \nsulfur-35         87.32     \nthulium-168         93.1     \nfermium-257         100.5     \nthulium-170         128.6     \npolonium-210         138     \ncobalt-57         271.79     \nvanadium-49         330     \ncalifornium-248     333.5     \n\nisotope         half-life (years)\nruthenium-106         1.023     \nneptunium-235         1.084     \ncadmium-109         1.267     \nthulium-171         1.92     \ncaesium-134         2.0652     \nsodium-22         2.602     \nrhodium-101         3.3     \ncobalt-60         5.2714     \nhydrogen-3         12.32     \ncalifornium-250     13.08     \nniobium\nmeta state Nb-93m     16.13     \nstrontium-90         28.79     \ncurium-243         29.1     \ncaesium-137         30.17\n\nClearly, each of these is observable within a single human lifetime; far \nmore than the \"minimum of no less than two separate, complete radioactive \ndecay life-cycles\". Furthermore, no process has ever been observed that \neffects the decay rate sufficiently enough to make dating methods based on \nhalf-lifes unviable.\n\n2. Your 2nd comment - \"The problem with all current dating methods...\"\nThe following is a list of dating methods used in addition to radiometric \ndating:\nCosmogenic Nuclide Geochronology\nLuminescence dating\nIncremental dating\nMagnetostratigraphy\nCorrelation of marker horizons\nAre ALL of these methods flawed in your estimation, or is it just \nradiometric dating that you feel is wrong? More damaging to your position \nis the use of carbon dating on items of a known age and the accuracy of the \nresults. I must add, before you attempt to imply that this is a stupid \nargument because the testers knew the age of the item and therefore just \nclaimed that the results were accurate; I would sincerely recommend doing \nsome unbiased research into radiometric dating methodology.\n\n3.

Terms \nare crafted because the need for differing terms for differing \nphenomenon/objects and what have you was deemed necessary. It is very \nsimple wwwelkman, I've said it twice now and I will say it yet again.\n\nEvolution by definition requires that increased complexity is necessary for \nsomething to be evolutionary. Adaptation does not require increases in \ncomplexity, and always has a purpose for happening (namely, addressing \na deficiency, where evolution does not).  I don't have to tell you exactly \nwhat the difference is, but just because I can take part of the same route \nto get to completely different destinations does not make my route the same \nboth times. That is pretty stupid thinking if you believe that that is the \ncase, because I can assure you, that while the route from California \nto Florida, and the route from California to Texas may be the same for a \nwhile.. the final destinations are drastically different.\n\nTerminology is not an excuse for anything, it is about accuracy. The whole \npremise of the \"big bang\" or whatever you want to call that silly idea is \nlousy no matter what term you apply, it isn't about the term in that \ncase. In reference to your question ZyneXx, my argument is that Evolution \nis not factual as many have been touting, and is arguable whether or not \nthe term Theory is even properly applied. To a degree, I feel Evolution is \nbeing VERY improperly pushed as being true or factual when in reality that \nis far from accurate.\n\nHypothesis: A proposition, or set of propositions, set forth as an \nexplanation for the occurrence of some specified group of phenomena, either \nasserted merely as a provisional conjecture to guide investigation (working \nhypothesis)  or accepted as highly probable in the light of established \nfacts.\n\nTheory: a coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded \nas correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction \nfor a class of phenomena: \n\nor\n\nA proposed explanation whose status is still conjectural and subject to \nexperimentation, in contrast to well-established propositions that are \nregarded as reporting matters of actual fact.\n\nBoth of those terms would fit Evolution, but fact most certainly does not. \nMy argument is primarily about the factual (or more particularly in this \ncase, lack thereof) nature of Evolution vs Creation. In all reality, if we \nwant to be honest about it... both the Theory of Evolution and Creationism \nrely primarily on faith and educated guessing at the core. It troubles me \nhow many people seem to think that Evolution is scientific, when really it \nhas little or no basis in science, but rather has become something that \nmany \"scientists\" attempt to make science fit rather than the other way \naround as it should be. Evolution thus far is a farce, and the failure to \nconsider other options is a disservice to the world, to science, and a \ndisgrace to any \"scientist\" who cannot be objective enough to consider more \noptions than just the one that fits their agenda. In truth, Science is very \nlimited and must be acknowledged as such before it can actually be useful \nfor discovery. I fear this is part of the reason we have discovered so \nlittle in the past 50+ years or so.. we have mostly been refining what we \nlearned from scientists before us for half a century. I am not suggesting \nwe have discovered nothing, but I can say that we have actually discovered \nvery few new scientific laws since the generation of Einstein passed away \n(about 10 discoveries, the majority of which were based upon ideas/research \nthat was started by Einstein and his contemporaries).\n\nWe have not had a shortage in brilliant minds.. just quite a number of \nbrilliant minds who seem overly distracted with trying to prove completely \nunrelated theories instead of doing what their predecessors did... find \nproblems and solve them rather than find problems and attempt to find or \ncraft solutions that fit into their view of the universe. I find/feel there \nis more of a disconnect between both the masses understanding of science, \nand the \"scientists\" truthfulness to the products and processes of good \nscience. It looks/feels like most scientists are just another arm to any \nnumber of different propaganda machines on various sides of various issues \nwhen the only thing that should ultimately matter is the accuracy of facts, \nnot what conclusions one can attempt to make from them even. A good \nexperiment should yield good, factual evidence, not \"good results\". \"Good \nresults\" suggest a likely bias, which is assured to be part of the basis of \nquestionable science. Any result that yields verifiable information is a \ngood result, not just ones that agree with the original hypothesis in \ntesting. If all results are not published, I would say it is fair to \nquestion the honesty of the publisher and/or the scientist who recorded \nthem. So in summation, my beef is with what I believe is more of a \ndisservice to science and the world by scientists who refuse to simply test \nnature to see how it works in favor of attempting to see how they can make \nthings fit into their notions of how our universe operations. The \ndifferentiation is relatively subtle, but very important as it is a \nfundamental difference in approach that tends to cause diluted and/or \npolluted results."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe1CRb4ppxu4cAEyi79vTPQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ZyneXx", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12su515hyffszttg22rjbahdom3gl5ud", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-16T21:39:05.602Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCe1CRb4ppxu4cAEyi79vTPQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.67020600000000008, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-16T21:39:05.602Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OdbBrVQSYI0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABg/YA4Ev2Neqtg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101091710951950949476", "textDisplay": "+tirendir How is terminology an excuse to explain the observations we make? \nIt has nothing do do with terms.

Evolution requires \nincreasing complexity while adaptation does not. Evolving also requires \ncertain progress, where the adapting of a breed to a particular environment \ndoes not make them more advanced.. it simply makes them better suited for \none environment while they would be more likely to fail in others. That is \nnot evolution by definition, no greater complexity or advancement of state \nwas gained.. only a situation-specific change that is only necessarily \nbeneficial in that specific situation. The Silver Fox is still a Fox.... It \nwas never (and still isn't) anything besides a fox. Evolution is not a \nfact, as it has never been recorded before. A Fact is nothing more than \nfirst-hand verified information. A Fact is not what some scientist thinks \nabout the hard facts, nor are what scientists translations of collected \ninformation actually facts. Facts are the records of  \"I observed that this \nhappened\" and nothing more. Everything past that point is no longer \nfactual, but is a different part of the scientific method. Evolution is an \nunproven and untested hypothesis, as it has never been observed and \ntherefor appropriately not recorded. The breeding of dogs into different \nbreeds is also not evolution.. that is simply breeding and tailoring for \nspecific traits.. however it is actually a degradation, because to breed \ntraits of a creature.. the preceding creatures must have had more traits \nthan the one that is being bred. Ere-go that is actually a reduction of \ncomplexity and actually a complete opposite of evolution just as the Silver \nFox is of its' parent foxes. The parent fox is not the reason they cannot \nbreed.. the silver fox is incapable of producing healthy offspring when \nmingled with the same genes as its' progenitors due to degredation and \nmodifications in the breed that have caused incompatibility (likely as a \nnatural defense against predators who would easily pick off unsuited \noffspring that would likely also compromise the otherwise healthy and well \nadjusted parents).\n\nAnd no, modern dating methods are not reliable as they rely on assumptions \nthat cannot be proven for many millennia and anyone who would rely on such \npresumption is foolish. That is an egregious breach in scientific \nmethodology. Until we have successfully observed the entirety of a minimum \nof no less than two separate, complete radioactive decay life-cycles.. we \ncannot have any way of verifying the accuracy of the claims regarding them. \nWe have no way of knowing if they decay rates speed up drastically near the \nend... or if they are faster at the beginning, or that certain atomic \nreactions (or lack thereof) cause different behavior because we have not \nyet had the time to test all of those things on any single specimen. The \nlong and short, while mathematically we can get a pretty fair idea about \nthe timespan required for radioactive decay for certain elements.. we have \nto guess and presume that the decay rate that we have studied (which is a \nsmall fraction of the whole) is constant and always has been before we can \neven consider using it as a dating mechanism. The problem again, is that we \nhave no way of knowing that fact since even the oldest recorded history \nthat we can verify with actual calendars or solar events is no more than \naround 5000-6000 years old. Was there time before that? quite possibly.. \nbut we have no way of knowing for certain because Science is not a tool for \nHistory or determining it. Science is a tool for the present that is only \nuseful for helping to better predict or discern happenings in the future, \nand to better understand our universe.

Creationists admit their view is a belief while \nevolutionists wont admit their's to be a belief. Creationists will continue \nto admit what they can't explain and can't back up, but evolutionists are \nthe complete opposite. I've made my decisions based on the research and \nstudy that I have done. Have you honestly done the same. If I truly wanted \nto I could debate a creationist on evolution and make very good points, but \nultimately I would be lying to myself.\n\nHope you stop judging a book by its first sentence because that's the only \nway you'll end up seeing where creationists are coming from."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqAHK7yf_r7GnZJSfX6Tkkw", "inappropriate_score": 0.45662100456621002, "authorDisplayName": "Mark Kirby", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12gxr2aimmmy1rut22khjeq0ru4elriq04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-13T09:03:28.017Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqAHK7yf_r7GnZJSfX6Tkkw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.6300079999999999, "formal_score": 83, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-13T09:03:28.017Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107021826776225638477", "textDisplay": "On why fossils prove god : I went to the site very first line was \n\"Evolution for the most part is based on one's interpretation of \nsedimentary strata and the fossils found therein\" This is wrong and it was \nthe first line, and they are wrong, sop why would I read on.\n\nAs for the DNA source : ANY site that frequently uses the term \n\"Evolutionism\" is presenting a strawman.

Much of what scientists discover in QM \nand cosmology are out of the ordinary and we cannot relate it to our \neveryday experiences.\nKen Ham was better able to connect to the audience by using common sense \nand everyday experiences that would relate to everyone's feelings and \nemotions. This allowed the audience to understand what he was saying. \nMeanwhile, Bill Nye used science based on observation, hypotheses, \nexperimentation, and peer-review which is very difficult to understand. \nThis left much of the audience with a \"Whaaaat?!\" look on their face. \nIn conclusion, if you ever wanna win a debate, go for common sense and \nintuition.

That's not the way the 'mind of faith' tends to work. Like the \nold bumper sticker in the 70's said: \"The Bible says it. I believe it. And \nthat settles it\"---that's where it begins, and ends with most Christians. \nReason, since it is a human thing, is automatically suspect as being \"of \nthe Devil.\" No wonder Creationists despises science. That's it in a nut \nshell.\n\nI think that except for a very tiny, tiny amount of people who might be \nvacillating on the edge of belief and non-belief, a \"rational discussion\" \nis not going to happen. In a sense, today has some parallels with the way \nAmerica was so divided just prior to the Civil War; and just as \nintractable. We have arrived again at a point where no discussions are \npossible. As each side grows more intransigent, and as non-religious \naffiliation increases, religion grows more desperate, and more and more \nirrational, and is trying to adopt a scientific aura. The spectacle is both \nhumorous, as well as pathetic.\n\nExcept for gay rights, evolution vs. creationism may very well prove to be \nthe rock on which this country founders. Every civilization in the past has \nhad something (and often more than one thing) that, ultimately, proved it's \nundoing. It could be that religion, and the mental impairment called \n\"faith\", will become so intransigent, and so caustic in it's rejection of \nscience, that America will be paralyzed, unable to function. You see this \nalready happening locally and nationally.\n\nAll the best scientific arguments in the world will have no effect on such \npeople as Ken Hamm. Other methods may be forced upon this country to try \nand settle the bitter divisions this country is now entangled in the long \nrun (Syria and Egypt are two recent examples of what could be in store for \nAmerica). It may just come down to that. Unfortunately. The more push-back \nreligion is faced with, the more it grows in strength, and irrational \nabsurdities.  Unbelievers are often dismayed by this. But that is what the \nmind of faith is like! I applaud Bill Nye for debating with Ken Hamm, but \nI'm afraid it was largely a waste of time. America will not be able to \ndodge the threat that religion poses for secular democratic government by a \nfew debates! If you believe that, it's just wishful thinking.

If God is real how was he just \n\"there\" something would have to make him, just as something would have to \nmake an explosion (the big bang). I'm agnostic, which means I don't know \nwhat happened nor can I prove/disprove any of them. Neither can you. If I \nfind irrefutable evidence then I will consider to change my mind. Don't say \n\"Oh well the bible is irrefutable evidence\" because no it's not. It was \nmade by something/someone or it could not exist right? Well then why can \ngod exist without something having to make him?\nThe Big Bang would have to have 3 things to happen since it was an \nexplosion. A heat source, fuel, and oxygen. Something would also have to \nmake those things. But, God would have to be made from something/someone as \nwell. Will we ever know what made them or will we always be blind. Also it \nis said that \"Thou shalt not kill\" well what about the soldiers fighting \nfor America? They kill all the time but, it is to protect Americans. Same \nthing for the people of Germany, the German soldiers fight to protect their \nland and citizens. But regardless both of those are killing, so would that \nmean that all soldiers fighting for you deserve to go to hell and live in \nfire forever? Or should they be rewarded and be able to go to heaven, that \nwouldn't make sense because they killed. So show me and the rest of the \nworld evidence that cannot be dis-proven, until then believe what you want \nand don't hate me for what I believe, because according to God you should \nnot hate. So all the hate comments I saw the creationists put about \"how \nthe Atheist scum are going to hell\" be a little nicer or you will be \ndisobeying God. Another thing is how everything happens for a reason, well \nI am supposed to believe my own thing for a reason, there is beheadings in \nthe middle east for a reason. Ken Ham or Bill Nye got their ass kicked for \na reason. I don't know why any of those things happened but, I guess there \nis a reason according to God.

The \nproblem is that most of these guys aren't qualified to be authorities on \nevolution, even a microbiologist only works in a related field and the \nscope of their expertise is limited.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12axnijtq3qi3dsl23avf3jco2sxxzss": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeUIgVLq4YdJGe1oUyYNbsA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hRvYWbBvPmA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKs/hpmyr8jFKag/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "batmanfanforever08", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-20T22:25:53.236Z", "videoId": "jfwKQaLh9jQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeUIgVLq4YdJGe1oUyYNbsA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.041179999999999994, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-03-20T22:25:53.236Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108855959049101556781", "textDisplay": "I'm a Christian & I agreed with Bill Nye for most of this debate.

If they still believe in Santa after the \nage of 20 they will most likely ask him for favors for the rest of their \nlives.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13mznl44lq2dxsio04cd1og5pbvvjiqtdc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1hedpVSLUEitVGKi6E_2PQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vJ1L9xErEKk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAg/uoaw3mcM9kA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "sithmastur", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-10T03:19:52.362Z", "videoId": "jfwKQaLh9jQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1hedpVSLUEitVGKi6E_2PQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.72596799999999995, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-02-10T03:19:52.362Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100420995497321669767", "textDisplay": "Good thing Chelsey wasn't on this Common Room, is she even on anymore?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13hv12ozxnxybfze04cfvryqy3qjdhwtvk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt4o9Rwj4_g4u6Ea-Y2W06A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dicease Fletcher", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-28T00:39:40.100Z", "videoId": "jfwKQaLh9jQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCt4o9Rwj4_g4u6Ea-Y2W06A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46845399999999998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-28T00:39:40.100Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114331288145207938800", "textDisplay": "I am a stong Christian Republican who believes in creationism and that \nJesus is the messiah...\n*Puts up flame shield lvl 8500*\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt4o9Rwj4_g4u6Ea-Y2W06A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dicease Fletcher", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13hv12ozxnxybfze04cfvryqy3qjdhwtvk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-25T22:58:27.645Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCt4o9Rwj4_g4u6Ea-Y2W06A"}, "sentiment_score": 0.077374000000000054, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-25T22:58:27.645Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114331288145207938800", "textDisplay": "+Ryan Holt Oh shiiit"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaOAUgng50fCnuSQSmMBPfw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ryan Holt", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13hv12ozxnxybfze04cfvryqy3qjdhwtvk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-04T08:14:18.804Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaOAUgng50fCnuSQSmMBPfw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.90476380000000001, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-04T08:14:18.804Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101053903920411005563", "textDisplay": "+Dicease Fletcher Its a shame you're shield's power level wasn't over 9000"}}]}, "z131x3o5skvkuzzd523luljqtmath1dqv04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjRiocDEWzYlJdFNHud91Zg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pfrpm_VkHj8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXM/gBxXBb4vGmM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "SeriousWarrior001", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-08T11:13:01.177Z", "videoId": "jfwKQaLh9jQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjRiocDEWzYlJdFNHud91Zg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.93328199999999994, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-03-08T11:13:01.177Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116892616077009273366", "textDisplay": "The most annoying thing about this video?

It refers to a comprehensive explanation of \nsome aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many \nscientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely \nto alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate \nthat the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that \nliving things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not \ncomposed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into \nsolid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of \nplate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories \nis that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or \nphenomena that have not yet been observed.[7]\n\nSo it usually has to meet the below\n\nIt makes falsifiable predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad \narea of scientific inquiry (such as mechanics).\n\nIt is well-supported by many independent strands of evidence, rather than a \nsingle foundation. This ensures that it is probably a good approximation, \nif not completely correct.\n\nIt is consistent with pre-existing theories and other experimental results. \n(Its predictions may differ slightly from pre-existing theories in cases \nwhere they are more accurate than before.)\n\nIt can be adapted and modified to account for new evidence as it is \ndiscovered, thus increasing its predictive capability over time.\n\nIt is among the most parsimonious explanations, sparing in proposed \nentities or explanations. (See Occam's razor. Since there is no generally \naccepted objective definition of parsimony, this is not a strict criterion, \nbut some theories are much less economical than others.)\n\n--------------------------------------\nA hypothesis is pretty much the 'idea stage' and where it gets tested, then \nif the tests (which are plenty) prove to be accurate and work then it gets \npromoted to a theory.\n\nNatural selection - Theory\nCreationism - a very bad example of a hypothesis"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWYsRnl60ZChI1OCUcc_Kxw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Andrew \u201cEl Capitan\u201d Beaver", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z130jbgakzand1cw304ci5ngrnnbeljybe4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-17T19:41:22.324Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCWYsRnl60ZChI1OCUcc_Kxw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9666979, "formal_score": 13, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-17T19:41:22.324Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Se8pg-pXw9I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACc/3aNY79fcEus/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117787657782938033473", "textDisplay": "Apparently not.

Some of Hams rebutals I wish i could overtake due to Ken Hams \nstrong religious influence in his creationsist perspective, which without \nhis religious spin on it is actually quite a LOGICAL and RATIONAL theory.\n          Bill Nye shows Contempt in a few of his facial \nexpressions/reactions (especially at 1:02:08 into the Full Debate vid) \nwhich shows that he is withholding particular knowledge and/or saying false \ninformation...such as at 1;02:08 Bills claim about the tree sapling not \nsurviving being submerged under water is correct, However a fully grown \ntree would survive (the flood). If Bill could answer this question he would \nhave me convinced of his molecule-to-man theory...So you (Bill Nye) believe \nthat the structure of molecules rearranges itself to display the physical \nproperties of emotions, or cell multiplication, or life growth (for \nexample) as a result of some soulless binary code/mathematical algorythm \ndriving the molecules that is encrypted in life/nature??? NO! There is a \nuniversal INTELLIGENCE creating this (re)arrangement of molecules. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zy3eq3szkx5iyk04chpajnza2f3q4ans0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuN2_vW3ZiiH4FRqM1a_Irg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_RohSRj8QoI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/p6ka8CvUMwM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mohamed Yacine", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T19:14:39.994Z", "videoId": "jfwKQaLh9jQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuN2_vW3ZiiH4FRqM1a_Irg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.26158199999999998, "formal_score": 30, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T19:14:39.994Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101327952398300975873", "textDisplay": "get your beer from your .......B hhhhhhhhhh\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13djt4zzqnzi1nbo04cdnchqyfgxjfogco": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr0VdhSnrDVTJmPekAjAVFA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--CeBPUC-JI8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMI/phw1EA96nJc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "blazalchemist", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T17:45:09.363Z", "videoId": "jfwKQaLh9jQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCr0VdhSnrDVTJmPekAjAVFA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.68743200000000004, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T17:45:09.363Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110086069017627863660", "textDisplay": "Isnt it hilarious when a Conservative asks why somebody cares, and says \npeople can believe what they want?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12pt1qoswf5h1xxs04cdbya0obnwr3bwfo": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTyB_AwRZER9sZLZAPMQxkQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "BestFriendsGaming", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-13T04:17:47.690Z", "videoId": "jfwKQaLh9jQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTyB_AwRZER9sZLZAPMQxkQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.98760448999999995, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-05-13T04:17:47.690Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115987972780627498705", "textDisplay": "You're all idiots.

It's incredible how \nquickly you can defuse an enraged person. This skill is ideal in all \nlifestyles. It's great for the workplace involving customer service; you'll \nnotice how much nicer and calmer all customers are with you. Any debates \nyou have will be much less heated, and people will be more likely to see \nthe point you're trying to make. You'll be more likely to see the point \nthat other people are trying to make, even if you don't agree with it.\n\nIn general, if you project positivity, others will reflect it back. I think \nwe should all practice projecting positivity, regardless of our differences."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnDOrCFF2mJ8poaP3ROFAnA", "inappropriate_score": 0.63694267515923564, "authorDisplayName": "Andrew Yts", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ncjvqzm2nd513q22xc1bworzqgfeq304", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-17T12:38:45.705Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnDOrCFF2mJ8poaP3ROFAnA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.10505800000000004, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-17T12:38:45.705Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aL-0vYHV4uU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEE/e_xP3tUp9SI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108687152438479014344", "textDisplay": "Congratulations, you managed to repeat exactly what i said and still \ncontradict me.

Everyone \nwho has been religious has not changed their opinions of view based on the \ndebate. Same applies to the millions of atheist. In other words all this \n\"debate\" is doing is pointing out how stupid religious people are and \ncreating negativity. I dont believe in god, but i do believe in positivity. \nIm not defending the orthodox, rather im pointing out the morons (TheSaczva \nfor example) who point out how ludicrous creationists concepts are, who are \npreaching something that makes no sense to preach.

Of course it matters. You \ncan see from the  Kilauea flow that something that should date near zero \ndated 21,000,000 million years. Thats a huge problem. If your buddy asked \nyou what grade you got on your math test and you told him two million \npercent, and you didn't have to answer 1 problem completely correctly. He'd \nprobably think... Hmm, I got them all right and only got 100%, Whoever \ngraded His test was either a fool or made a terrible mistake. Either way a \n2 million % mistake is significant.\n\nNow couple that with the fact that evolutionists love to claim everything \nis really really really... old and prove it with dramatic ages you'll never \nget accurate date.\nRemember the assumption, how much mother material vs daughter material was \ncontained in the rock to begin with? THERE IS ZERO... NIL... NADA... ZILCH, \nNO, NOT AN IOTA of a possibility that a scientist could EVER EVER know that \nunless they had a good known start date, and I don't know of 1 scientist \nthat lived billions of years ago. If you find one though that would really \ndestroy the rest of the evolution theory.\nAnother assumption that is a monumental roadblock to isotope dating is \nwhether or not there was any contamination to the specimen along the way, \nso unless the rock was monitored from its beginning and maybe stored in a \njar to the date of the test there is NO way to tell if the test is \naccurate. It could have been heated along the way, or perhaps trapped under \nthe pressure of a massive world wide flood or something.. NOBODY knows, so \nwhether or not the rest of the process is flawless Radiometric dating as a \nwhole is FLAWED.\n \nIt's like Cwalon said, You're so steeped in scientism that you can't see \nthe forest through the trees. You think science is the only proof of \nanything. Creationists can't verify with science that the earth is 6-10 \nthousand years old. (NEITHER CAN EVOLUTIONISTS). But through timelines and \ngenealogies we can have a very good idea when God created it. It only works \nthough if the source can be trusted. This is where most religions break \ndown. There is nothing to make them credible. The Bible is different, The \nBible gives amazing prophecies such as the rebirth of Israel in the last \ndays, including their original language, The Jews are there now. Prophecies \nconcerning Jesus; Incredible Biblical stories like the parting of the Red \nSea, and Sodom and Gomorrah that have been backed up by recent \narchaeological discoveries; Eyewitness accounts of the Messiah dying on the \ncross, being resurrected, and ascending into heavens; These eyewitnesses \nwere persecuted and killed for not denouncing what they had seen. The Bible \nhas certainly stood the test of time. It is real. God gave us His word, His \npromises, and plenty of evidence that He is who He says He is. and will do \nwhat He says He'll do. What we do with all of it is up to us.\n\nPsalm 14:1 \n The fool says in his heart, \u201cThere is no God.\u201d They are corrupt, they do \nabominable deeds, there is none who does good.

The theory of gravity and such are used to back \nthis up. The only difference is that gravity can be tested. It is \nabsolutely observable, unlike evolution... Oh wait... bacteria has been \nobserved turning into bacteria, haven't they. I guess that settles it for \nsome.\nIt's funny that you mentioned the growing number of atheists, because the \nBible says that in the end times that there is going to be a great falling \naway from the truth of the Gospel. It is happening just as Jesus predicted. \nI am surprised that you called your belief system a religion. Most atheists \nwant to fight if you tell them evolution is a religion.\nFictional evolution will be worshipped instead of a fictional deity? Tell \nme Bryce, where does your science say we all came from? Did something exist \neternally? Did we all come from non-living things and all of a sudden life \njust popped into existence? Super mega complex life just assembled itself \none day and then started its uphill climb from microbe to man??? sounds \nvery believable to me.\nYour religion is a convenient one. We were all created by the great god \nNothing (with a little help from his friends Random and Chance). we were \ncreated for nothing too. Here's the convenient part- since we were created \nby nothing and for nothing, we are also accountable to nothing (except a \nmorally bankrupt society) and for nothing. We can now call things good bad \nand bad things good, right? and then when it's all over we all go back to \nour great god \"Nothing\"  That's great news.\nIs that what you think Bryce? Wait, where did the thought come from \nscientifically?  \nThanks for your service"}}]}, "z12yjvdhxymihtvod04cdjmz2qrsuhd5ct40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvfHDIOm8wU_cX8-BXSDgGg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NnnS2JL9IW0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKo/YK_kCgkbWRw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "phteven Z", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T21:16:08.319Z", "videoId": "jfwKQaLh9jQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvfHDIOm8wU_cX8-BXSDgGg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.92807390000000001, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T21:16:08.319Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111695922578118629403", "textDisplay": "*Creation museum\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13vxzfjmsndfhyvk23tclooixr5xnoo404": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzlgL0OkMeFqqrvhlXDHSUA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-w8F5Lnow-VA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/rBZlswCqbQk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Buddy Landry", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-16T15:35:34.392Z", "videoId": "jfwKQaLh9jQ", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCzlgL0OkMeFqqrvhlXDHSUA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.55499999999999994, "formal_score": 15, "updatedAt": "2014-02-16T15:35:34.392Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108780814162165622777", "textDisplay": "Can't know what happened in the past?

So that there \nis a limit to how small something can be i.e Planck length, this is why we \nhave string theory that suggest that our universe is actually controller by \nparticles we can't see or interact with hence the term dark matter, which \nscientist thinks makes up 95% of the universe.

This isn't to call you \nstupid, it's a complex subject. But you are claiming to know what you're \ntalking about and have been misrepresenting it.\n\nAs in other genomes, the DNA of the human genome is not a static entity. \nInstead, it is subject to a variety of different types of heritable change \n(otherwise known as mutation). Large-scale chromosome abnormalities involve \nloss or gain of chromosomes or breakage and rejoining of chromatids. \n\nSmaller scale mutations can be grouped into different mutation classes and \ncan also be categorized on the basis of whether they involve a single DNA \nsequence or whether they involve exchanges between two allelic or \nnonallelic sequences. Three classes of small-scale mutation can be \ndistinguished.\n\nThese small scale mutations are Base substitutions, Deletions, and \nInsertions. So basically, yes information is \"dropped off\" sometimes, but \nDNA is never degraded... DNA changes over time THUS evolution.\n\n\"but you expect me to believe that such a complex process is being guyed \n(guided) by random mutations without a knowledgeable guide.\"\n\n>> You were talking about the eye. Ok... so we're doing the irreducible \ncomplexity argument? really? You do realize how hard this has been debunked \nright? *sigh*\n\nOk i'm going to explain very simply how evolution makes something like the \neye happen.\n\nThe survival of the most adaptable is usually favored. This means the \ncreature most able to live and procreate in its surroundings compared to \nthose who are not adapted will have more of a chance to pass on its genetic \ncode.\n\nIf a creature has favorable traits it will breed more (have more \nopportunity to breed due to its advantages), the mediocre will breed a \nmediocre amount, and the vastly underwhelming will die off quickly not \nhaving a chance to breed. This is not in ALL cases but a statistical \nmajority large enough to allow for positive adaptable change to happen.\n\nThe genes are passed on over time and traits which favor survivability win \nout over lesser traits. The eye in all it's complexity is a series of very \nsimple advances.\n\nThe earliest predecessors of the eye were photo receptor proteins that \nsense light. over time small mutations allowing better ways to view the \nvisible light spectrum won out. If you want a FULL and detailed look at the \nevolution of the eye see the link below.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye\n\n\"I am not a statition but i'm willing to bet the chances of random mutation \nforming any kind of complex organic structure within the human body is \nimprobable.\"\n\n>> A complex organic structure wasn't formed randomly in human beings. eyes \ndeveloped over hundreds of thousands of years starting as being able to \nsense light (like plants) and finally into what we have now... MILLIONS of \nyears. We weren't humans as we know it at that point. When you could \nclassify us as human we already had eyes due to previous ancestors having \nformed the building blocks for them.\n\n\"Now understand that we as humans are the only species that is able to \ncomprehend our existence and come to the conclusion that our universe is \nfinely turned for our survival,\"\n\n>> It's the other way around. We are finely tuned due to millions of years \nof trial and error by our genes to exist in the world we now live in. Trust \nme, the universe is largely unconcerned with your survival. If I didn't \nknow better I'd think it was trying to kill us.\n\nDiseases, asteroids, a complete vacuum of space... You're telling me you \ncouldn't come up with a more hospitable universe? Really? Because I could \non a cocktail napkin after 3 drinks.\n\nI mean... even our bodies. Our reproductive system is connected to the \nwaste area. If god was a city planner he'd be fired.\n\nAlso, evolution isn't always a good thing. It has it's misfires and \nmistakes because sometimes a trait works very well in one scenario for a \nperiod of a few hundred thousand years and is then disastrous the next few \nthousand (which usually ends in extinction)\n\nEvolution is simply the mechanism of change. It is not for our benefit. It \nis the mechanism ALL life on this planet evolves and changes which mines \nwhile we are evolving so are viruses and diseases which want to eat us.\n\nYou mention the eye. the eye has problems my friend. MANY people are near \nsighted, far sighted, and so on. \n\nDo you know how much light in the spectrum of all light out there we can't \nsee?! It's ridiculous! We can't see MOST of the colors that exist. The eye \nif made by god is BELOW what we can create now. The only thing we can't do \nat this point is connect such a tool to our brains which IS being worked on.\n\n\"So now your job is to tell me what factors allow for the cosmological \nconstant be the exact number that it is, or the pull of gravity to be the \nexact number that it is, or the ...\"\n\n>> Going to stop you there. It's not my job to do anything. As I stated \nbefore the universe doesn't care about you or I on the grand scale of \nthings. You're getting into abiogenesis and not evolution btw (common \ncreationist misstep). Evolution is not equal to the big bang or how the \nuniverse was formed. It's not even to do with the origins of life. It has \nto do with the manner in which life progresses on Earth. Nothing more, \nnothing less.\n\nClosing:\n\nAs I stated, I never intended to insult your religion, unless your religion \nis soley based on the creation story. I believe however that you most \nlikely believe in god regardless of creation or evolution so no harm no \nfoul.\n\nFeel free to respond if you wish. But please do not keep using creationist \ntalking points that have been overly debunked.

Now since we live in a digital universe governed by \ninformation the law of entropy tell us that information will move from \norder to disorder as time moves on, but you would like me to believe that \nmutations in your genetic code will add new information as time move on, \nwhen in fact mutations destroy information and degrade the DNA.\n\nNow back to these transitional form, you expect me believe that something \nas complex as lets say an eye, which has 15 different parts which work \ntogether to allow you to see could be mutated over millions of years while \nwaited to allow and organism to see, because if one out of the fifteen \nparts does not work then the lifeform is not able to see, but you expect me \nto believe that such a complex process is being guyed by random mutations \nwithout a knowledgeable guide. I am not a statition but i'm willing to bet \nthe chances of random mutation forming any kind of complex organic \nstructure within the human body is improbable.\n\nThis is where the problem with evolution lies because you need to assign \nintelligence to whatever is developing these lifeforms, because it doesn't \nmake sense say that a random process can produce information when the \nentire universe is set in motion by the information that came before it. \nNow understand that we as humans are the only species that is able to \ncomprehend our existence and come to the conclusion that our universe is \nfinely turned for our survival, so it is not just your so called mutations \nin our genes that allow us to survive but it the universe at large and the \nlaws that govern it ensure our survival.\n\nSo now your job is to tell me what factors allow for the cosmological \nconstant be the exact number that it is, or the pull of gravity to be the \nexact number that it is, or the position of the earth relative to the sun \nis the exact position that it is to allow our survival, or the position of \nmoon that allow it to totally eclipse the sun circumference to \ncircumference,or the pull and electron tho be the exact number that it is, \nand there's many more example that demonstates that their is an \nintelligence ensuring our existence,because as you can see it goes far \nbeyond the scope of our genes but one day maybe you will discover that the \nentire universe is built for our survival.\n\nAs you can see I stated the reasons for my beliefs without insulting your \nintelligence or even claim that I am smarter than you, so you see it is \npossible for two people to present there ideas without resorting to piety \nname calling, and for the future if decide to respond to someones argument \nplease try not to think of yourself superior to them just because you think \nyou know something they don't, its not really going to help your case, \nbecause where all human being on a path to knowledge.

I said young earth creationism is a stupid \nconcept. I really am sorry if that offends you but it is.\n\nThere are tons of transitional fossils. This is a false claim made by \npeople who do not understand evolution. A transitional fossil is simply a \nfossil which shows the various stages of evolution in a species.\n\nThe argument against transitional fossils often comes from ignorance as to \nwhat a transitional fossil is. This being said it is impossible to find \nEVERY transitional fossil for a species... I mean think about it.\n\nLet's say a species evolves from A to Z. If you find the fossils for ABCDE \n-G--------P--S--T--WXYZ (which we have) but you are missing several fossils \ndue to the fact that fossils get destroyed, haven't been found yet, aren't \npresent due to geological issues, or so on... Does that instantly make ALL \nthe other transitional fossils irrelevant?\n\nNo... It does not, and it's dishonest to state otherwise. The only thing \nyoung earth creationists have been able to do with this evidence is to \neither flat out ignore it or state that these aren't transitional \nfossils... which is ludicrous as we can date back the most recent ones with \nour own DNA, linking them to the entire line.\n\nFor a list go to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils\n\nYou say something interesting here...\n\n\"you would be able to tell me the process by which new information is added \nto an organism,\"\n\nMutations happen... matter of fact it's a key to evolution.\n\nMost, if not all, \"entirely new features\" are modifications of previously \nexisting features. Evolution NEVER states that absolutely new \"features\" \njust pop out of existence... this is actually what creationism claims. That \ngod just waved a finger and NEW BEINGS (not just features) arose.\n\nBird wings, for example, are modified tetrapod forelimbs, which are \nmodified sarcopterygian pectoral fins. A complex, entirely new feature, \nappearing out of nowhere, would be evidence for creationism, NOT of \nevolution. Matter of fact if you found one of these half bird half reptile \ncrocoducks you wouldn't prove evolution, you would probably disprove it or \nat least force scientists to completely rethink how it works.\n\nNew features have evolved from older different features. There are several \nexamples of microorganisms evolving the ability to degrade or metabolize \nnovel man made compounds\n\nSuch as...\n\narsenobetaine degradation and chlorocatechol degradation.\n\nOnto a few other points. How does computer science help you out with \neducation in other fields? Like... evolutionary biology? Because it seems \nto me as you are extremely uneducated in something you seem to severely \ndisagree with.\n\nI for one want to know everything about my opponents position before I \nargue points against it... you came to a gun fight with a knife.\n\nYou say that Biochemists at the top of their field don't know how our DNA \ncan facilitate so much information... congratulations, all you just said \nwas that scientists don't know everything.\n\nIf scientists knew everything there wouldn't be a need for people to be \nscientists as scientists are in by nature in a search for answers...\n\nHow would it make sense for them to know everything? What you are \ncondemning evolution for is the fact that scientists don't know how our DNA \ncan hold so much information? You have to be kidding me...\n\nFor the last point. Faith. Faith is by definition belief without evidence. \nI base my assumptions of the world ON evidence therefore I have no faith in \nit. I DEMAND evidence for what I believe.\n\nA counter question. Can you provide solid evidence, peer reviewed and \ntestable for the existence of god? \n\nI hold no malice towards those who believe but there is no evidence for it \ntherefor it demands faith\n\nAnd evidence means testable, repeatable, evidence.\n\nThis however is not about god. I was just outlining what faith is.\n\nYou can believe in god, and all that other stuff you love so much BUT the \nassertion that the world is 6,000 years old and that we are not part of an \nevolutionary cycle, if false DOES NOT disprove your faith.\n\nIt simply disproves that some parts of the bible are literal and \nsubsequently that you have been lied to either intentionally or unknowingly \nby others who believe it.\n\nSorry, but the facts are on my side. I'm fairly certain you will continue \narguing, but there is very little I can see you proving to me with your \ncurrent comprehension. I suggest you take an evolutionary biology class to \nactually understand what it is before debating it on the internet.\n\n(PS: I've read all the creationist literature to understand my opponents in \ndebate, you should do the same. don't start with Darwin. The field has \nadvanced over the last century and it's out of date.)\n\nStart with Why Evolution is True for a beginners look into it. If you don't \nagree with it, at least you'll understand where others are coming from and \nbe better armed to handle people like myself."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBpQI-V24qcV14Ef-EjiVsA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "chris codling", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13jeffp2vimu5xlq23vutzi1wnvtfmgg04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-10T14:54:50.160Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBpQI-V24qcV14Ef-EjiVsA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.334816, "formal_score": 92, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-10T14:54:50.160Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4j8JErE5KiA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC8/tsfwFj1Mgmo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116459859843310935342", "textDisplay": "+edenscancer I've studied computer science at university so you telling me \nthat I need an education is solely based on the fact that you believe that \nreligious people are dumb and can't possible have an education.\n\nAs for evolution being a testable science, if it where true you would be \nable to tell me the process by which new information is added to an \norganism, and keep in mind that biochemist at the top of their field don't \neven know how 20,000 lines of code can be added to the DNA molecule to make \nthe transition from ape to human.

Then again he is an engineer, that has \nalmost nothing to do with evolution and biology and geology, but simply \nuses some (not so common, obviously) common sense to counter Ham's \nridiculous claims. \n\nSnow layers are actually representative of years just like rings in tree \n(growth increase in summer, and decrease in winter) or corrals or carbonate \nstructures in caves and so on, because you see seasons of snow (that goes \ninto firn and then ice form gradually) accumulation (winter) and melting \n(summer). So why is it even there if it melts you might ask, well that's \nbecause it melts a lot less than it accumulates during winter therefore you \nsee a glacier forming with many compressed layers inside of it. \n\nBefore you start calling people ignorant, please stop teaching children \npreposterous lies and don't spread that crap all over the internet. \n\nAlso what is this about Catholics (or other confessions) and money? They \nmade shitloads of it before evolution (even opposing it and executing \npeople for centuries) and they will continue to do it while people are \nwilling to support them.\n\nAny other questions? Even though i hate to waste time on these kind of \npeople once again and again, maybe someone will read my somewhat reasonable \nargument (i hope) and start thinking on their own not relying on Ham to \ntell them how to live their lives. It is seriously disturbing these people \nlike him get away with it... Oh right, freedom of religion, the golden \nticket.... I'll just go ask TFSM what is his opinion on all this.

This is a debate about \ncreationism being a correct means to the beginning of life. Even in this \nparagraph, you didn't put any proof of creationism, you attacked other \ntheories.\n\nHam is wrong. There is correct ways to observe things, and incorrect ways \nto observe things. Ham's in the \"incorrect\" pile. That BS he spreads about \n\"different interpretations\" is unscientific. If he has something \nreasonable, he should publish it to peer-review.\n\nThere is no assumption that Carbon-14 remained constant. We know it \nchanges. Have you never heard of Amber before?

Get enough \nsamples, and we can use a graph.\nAnyway, even if you did say that Carbon dating has issues, there is still \nUranium-Lead, or Argon-Argon dating, which are completely independent \nmethods. Uranium-Lead has the advantage of always being in the same amount \neverywhere, so it's particularly dependable.\nFinally, NO method, ANYWHERE states that 6000 years is a right number.\n\nAs Bill said, it's very unreasonable that an ancient man built the biggest \nboat ever, with the largest cargo ever, with no modern engineering, or \nmaterials science.

I \ndon't see it.\n\nSee, here's the thing. You're buying into religious propaganda. Not facts. \nYou want facts? Look at the fact that \"no fossil swam up\".

Both Bill Nye and Ken \nHam have the exact same facts, but they have different interpretations.\n\nKen Ham, and the many creationist scientist throughout the world do have \nscientific proof for their beliefs that the earth is younger than people \nsay. For instance, Carbon-14 dating, which has been used to date dead \nanimals and sometimes rocks, is based on the assumption that the Carbon-14 \nto carbon-12 ratio has always remained constant. However, we know that due \nto Earth's decaying strength in magnetic field (Confirmed to have suspended \n10% since 1990) that carbon-14 levels are actually not the same as just \n10-30 years ago. Now imagine 4.1 billion years ago.\n\nWhile that's just one example, there are examples of why  a global flood is \na logical explanation, especially due to the fact that for fossils to be \npresent, they require a rapid burial so that the remains are not eaten or \ndecompose. If a global flood were to occur, that could easily explain the \nmillions of fossils, as it is said that every land-dwelling creature was \nkilled (aside from those on the ark)  during the flood.\n\nBefore ruling out that God doesn't exist by saying there is \"no proof\". \nconsult with the evidence that creationist's have found, that favor the \ncreationist viewpoint, as opposed to the evolutionary viewpoint. By NOT \nreviewing BOTH sides of evidence, you're being biased to the only side of \nevidence you've been willing to hear. \n\nAnd just so you know I'm not being hypocritical, I'm a reformed studied \natheist who has looked at both sides of the evidence, and not out of desire \nalone, but fact, I've chosen to place my faith in Jesus Christ."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHE3CREPW1n6ZzlU7bfKBpg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kaynex", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xwduowmzlypdep23czphiwwiistisr", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-23T17:04:47.451Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHE3CREPW1n6ZzlU7bfKBpg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.58100200000000002, "formal_score": 22, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-23T17:05:41.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2fWwYbST54M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/dMy6_TjEIWM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117227552070191482700", "textDisplay": "No, it's not important to debate these things.

Why are there \ndifferent races in the world if we don't adapt, and I pose this question \nonce more, can we observe 1 classification of a species of animals crossing \nover into another. Bill Nye sure did not present any evidence to confirm \nthat. You show me a cat having a dog like animal then you have a case, but \nit hasn't happened. \n\nYou have gotten extremely defensive about all of this which is expected.\n\n \"Look up what a Ring Species is\" \nI looked it up and of course this situation still diverges from 1 starting \nspecies. As I said before, there has yet to be a single animal that has \ncrossed from 1 kingdom or even family of animals to another. Send me a link \nto where this is 100% shown and you have a case. \n\n\"have we seen a cat turn into a lion in our lifetime, which is asinine. I \nfind it peculiar you think talking with Random Person A instead of a \nScientist B somehow makes your case when you haven't even made a coherent \nrebuttal yet..is a bit unsatisfying\" \n\n I just mentioned this because you talked about a cat turning into a lion. \nWhich a lion is still a lion which is still a part of the CAT family, it is \na CAT that has adapted to a harsh environment, essentially they are a part \nof the same family. It took me 5 minutes to see the fault in this argument, \nand essentially those who believe in evolution use the word to replace \nadaptation. Adaptation has been clearly seen, and observed. All animals \nadapt including us with the color of our skin, or our eyes, or our internal \norgans. Adaptation makes sense, but 1 family of animals changing into \nanother family, has NOT been observed nor confirmed. A cell is still a \ncell, a crab is still a crab, a bird is still a bird, a monkey is a monkey \nand a human is a human. \n\nI will try to make this distinction very very clear. Historical science and \nobservable science are two different things. Observable science is the \nworld we live in the present, what we see and can test to concretely \nconfirm. Historical science is making assumptions about the present \nprojecting them into the past in a perfect environmental situation. \n\nScience is about make prediction about the future, this is what Ken Ham was \ntrying to make clear. Evolution is taking what we know now and assuming \nthat no outside variables came into play. All of these carbon dating tests \nnever take into account that a flood happened. Therefore when these rocks \nare decaying at a certain rate, they believe this rate was unaffected by \nthe environment, or any other outside conditions. Its basically like saying \nwe have a formula and it must work with no experimental error. And then you \ntake multiple different formulas (different dating systems) which are \nsuppose to yield the same result and they don''t, they are off by millions \nof years. Two rocks from the same formation yielding ages off by hundreds \nof thousands of years?? Why is that taken as fact, but the hundreds of \nbillions of gallons of water and sedimentary rock under the earths surface \nshould be completely ignored?? \n\nLook I will get real with you, adaption of genes, germs and other things to \npredict and counter attack diseases is at the very heart of why I argue \nagainst evolution. Because those fields can be tested and confirmed with \nnear 100% accuracy, but evolution can't, yet they are put under the same \ntitle.\n\n Take intelligent design out of science and you have chaos. The law of \nentropy doesn't say that chaos goes to order, its the opposite and we see \nit every day. Taking random elements from space and then they form distinct \nordered cells, goes against what we know. So now we are on the same page, \nbecause you believe that life formed against the laws of thermodynamics, \nwho else can break the law other than He who created them? \n\nEVOLUTION IS NOT EVIL!!! It is mislabeled. Even Darwin himself said this in \nhis 1876 autobiography, Darwin argues, \"Another source of conviction in the \nexistence of God, connected with the reason and not with the feelings, \nimpresses me as having much more weight. This follows from the extreme \ndifficulty or rather impossibility of conceiving this immense and wondrous \nuniverse, including man with his capacity of looking backwards and far into \nfuturity, as a result of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting I \nfeel compelled to look to a First Cause having an intelligent mind in some \ndegree analogous to that of man; and I deserve to be called a Theist.\"\n\nEven the man who started all of this talk about adaptation couldn't believe \nit happened by chance. \n\nLastly, you can call me pathetic, irrational, stupid, or any other word \nthat helps you feel better about yourself but ultimately why? \n\nWhy do you care what I think? If we just are animals and die like \neverything else with no purpose, no reason, just a random chance, then why \ndo you give a second of your time to argue against me. In less than 80 \nyears we will both be dead. What is point in our multi-billion year old \nuniverse, we are just a spec of dust in this timeline according to you.\n\nBut what then if you are wrong, why do you question the past and the future \nif life is just \"shit happens\"...its because you care because if you are \nright then nothing matters, but if the word of God is right then everything \nmatters. \n\nEvery person questions their mortality, you have because of your trust in \nevolution as being the starting and ending point of life. Why do you \nquestion this? Do you care whether you live or die?\n\nAre you so proud that you can't be humble enough to think for just a second \nthat you are not in control of your life?  \n\nI have called on the Lord and been answered. You can do the same, if you \nhumble yourself enough to listen to what the Bible says. \n\nEvery burning question I have ever had has been answered and answered in \nten fold, by the word of God. I am encouraged by you challenging me. I \nlooked up what you told me to, and now I challenge you to do the same. \nDon't listen to denominations or people or Catholics or Mormons or \nJehovah's witnesses or anything else out there. Just read the Bible and I \nwill be so bold as to tell you please contact me on facebook or by some \nother means, my name is Zachary Seigman. There is so much I would like to \nshare with you, and how science does in fact line up with the word of God \nbut at the same time I want you to challenge me and try to prove me wrong.\n\nIf you will give Him and me a chance then I can promise you your life will \nbe changed forever.

No\"\n\nIt absolutely can be observed. In fact, Evolution has better empirical data \nas a 'Scientific Theory' than Gravity does. Look up what a Ring Species is \nwhen you get a chance to learn. I'm much more drawn to your lack study on \nthis topic and being so bold to say you can't observe it. Seeing as how you \ndon't even know that there's demonstrable evidence and overwhelming \nevidence at that, I doubt you've studied it hard.\n\n\n\"Does it follow the scientific method as being testable?, No\"\n\nAgain, the answer is yes. The Scientific Method is how we came to this \nlogical inference based on the empirical evidence in many fields of \nScience. If you come into this with a preconceived notion that 99% of \nBiologists worldwide are mistaken about Evolution, now you have the burden \nof proof since Evolution has reached 'Scientific Theory' status.\n\n\n\"Have we ever seen cross genetic species? No\"\n\nNot that you didn't show this before, but you've just shown again your \ngross misunderstanding of Evolution. I mean, what you're asking is \nbasically, have we seen a cat turn into a lion in our lifetime, which is \nasinine. I find it peculiar you think talking with Random Person A instead \nof a Scientist B somehow makes your case when you haven't even made a \ncoherent rebuttal yet..is a bit unsatisfying.\n\n\n\"I am an engineering student, and we follow the scientific laws and facts, \nthat are testable\"\n\nKey word here was 'student' you've got a lot more to learn about the \nscientific theories vs. scientific laws thing. Because Evolution is \nabsolutely testable and has a track record for it's remarkable and \nrepeatable Evidence. Don't pretend like this isn't a proven theory. We \nwouldn't have the breakthroughs in medical advancements like Antibiotics. \nWhich takes an understanding of Evolution to make Antibiotics.\n\n\n\"Ken Ham argued that historical science shouldn't be in the same place as \nobservable science, which is 100% correct\"\n\nThat's because historical science isn't science. Historical Science is \nbasically hearsay, mostly from old books that you really want to be true, \nwhich is not Scientific. For someone championing the Scientific Method \nearlier, you've expose yourself by promoting 'historical science' jargon \nwith, Science. And it came from a known loony toon like Ken Ham who made \nthe Flintstones Museum. Ken Ham arrogantly says no evidence no matter how \nobvious, would never convince him the other way. He's fallacious.\n\n\n\"If we can't test something then it falls under belief or faith\"\n\nNo, under your logic, it was perfectly acceptable to think the Earth was \nflat on faith because you could not prove the Earth was round in the old \ndays. Basically you're advocating stupidity and an Argument from Ignorance \nfallacy. You don't know how something works, so therefore your sky daddy \ngod did it or that's were faith comes in? Faith is gullibility, faith has \nno place in Science. You don't give a damn about the Scientific Method, \nbecause as soon as there's a mystery we can't solve at the time, you get to \nsay, well that's where my gullible faith comes in. No, you can celebrate \nyour ignorance with faith but I prefer reason and evidence.\n\n\n\"Evolution is the excuse for those who don't want to feel bad about their \nactions\"\n\nAh ha, I think we've come to the crux of the problem here. You think \nEvolution is some kind of evil thing when it's just what we observe. How is \nEvolution an \"excuse\" when it's just the observation of the evidence? What \nwe observe has nothing to do with our philosophies or epistemologies about \nlife. I think that being religious gives you an excuse to do bad things and \nclaim it was your religious right, people still do that today. And to just \nsay sorry to your sky daddy and get forgiven instead of asking the people \nyou wrong for forgiveness instead. In my worldview, I don't get away with \nanything, my legacy lives on whether it was peaceful or destructive. You \nare just warped my friend.\n\n\n'Who desire to live in whatever evil they are in each day, and not fear \njudgment\"\n\nI've noticed that creationists are kinda pathetic, they can't deal with the \nhardships of life, that shit just happens. Life is hard and wasn't created \nfor you, don't be so arrogant, we are animals, do you not bleed like an \nanimal? get over yourself. You need a sky daddy god to make believe that \nthere's a special place for you for using faith to believe in a god and a \ntorture land that far exceeds someones crime as a scare tactic to do good \nor to make you believe in the god. But being religious demonstrably doesn't \nmake people better, in fact, in highly religious or theocratic countries, \nthe societal ills are far worse than in secular countries and Secular \ncountries have the highest societal positives. And overwhelmingly, the jail \npopulation is full of religious people and only about 1% atheists. So much \nfor religion being a good thing.\n\n\n\"Is it worth it to follow something because the other MUST be irrational?\"\n\nNot \"must be\" it is irrational to believe in such weak hypothesis' like \ngods when our naturalistic understanding has far more evidence and doesn't \ngo into infinite regression like the idea of god has. Atoms clump together \nand make more complex shit, again, get over yourself, we are the universe, \nwe weren't made for it by some dad figure written by people who didn't even \nknow about germs or that the Earth was round.\n\n\n\"To then just find out that you have blinded by a lie\"\n\nOh, creationists, your irony never ceases to amaze me. You're the one \nbelieving in a magic man from an old book which doesn't follow the \nScientific method but follows gullible faith which can convince you to \nbelieve all sorts of lies.. ironic huh. Claims of believing in lies...wow, \ncoming from the one actually believing in Wild bullshit that you can't \nactually test or predict vs. Actual scientific theories that you can make \npredictions and test like gravity and evolution and germs."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRcGZ-CuOTLS8l58KOlD1HQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "saiyjin98", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13quhyznkelgl4kz23ge3ipcyu5hzuhp04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-15T10:19:45.913Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRcGZ-CuOTLS8l58KOlD1HQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.28715599999999997, "formal_score": 98, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-15T10:19:45.913Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115044834569270368994", "textDisplay": "+Zachary Seigman The reason why people keep getting sick from colds and \nflues is because the viruses evolve and our immune systems don't recognize \nthem.
