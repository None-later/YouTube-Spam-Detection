It's called access to birth control, the right \nto abortion, the right to vote for your representative and certain \nlegislation, the right to work, equal wage, etc. \n\nEquality means being equal in status, rights, and opportunity. You know \nyou're being ridiculous because you dissect the definition of equality in \norder to find a logical fallacy. No infanticide for men? You want male \ninfanticide? Do you even know of any countries nowadays where male \ninfanticide is a huge issue? No male only trains? the female only trains \nare in countries where women being sexually harassed and shamed is an issue \non a massive scale. Do you not think in the context of these situations? \nthese trains exist in developing countries. No choice to be a father? fuck \noff. fathers walk out on their wives all the time. If you were to say how \nsingle father's don't get child support from the mother, then you'd have a \npoint. But they do, so... No HeforShe? what about the women support the MRA \non the video? What about the fact that the men's rights movement was \nsupported Karen Straughan? The MRM was started in 1996. Feminism started in \nthe late 1800s. You expect all this support to fall into your lap? \nespecially with the hateful diatribe that the MRM evokes towards women? \nGood luck. Affirmative Action addresses minorities. Minorities means \nunderprivileged. An all-encompassing category such as men does not fit. No \nreproductive rights? It's called a condom. No concerns about low education? \nwell it's called  affirmative action, but again that addresses minorities. \n\n Yeah, I'm done listening to your nonsense. Because that's all it is. It's \nlike I said, you can't be convinced because you're too arrogant to consider \nan alternative opinion.

Feminism wants male rape victims to \nbe seen and cared for and hypermasculinity to be erased because women \naren't weak and fragile, and men aren't the symbol of natural strength and \ninfallibility. Feminism literally wants what \"men's rights activists\" want, \nas well as for rape to be taken seriously (the ratio of actual rape cases \nto false rape accusations is incredibly high because, oh yeah, most women \nare not attention-seekers who just want to make a man's life miserable), \nproper sex education and hygiene (so young people aren't confused and \nworried about natural things and homeless women don't have to scrape money \ntogether to buy sanitary products because apparently they aren't \n\"essential\"), and for women to not be labelled \"over-emotional\", \n\"unstable\", \"unable to handle leadership positions\" and any less than men.\n\nFeminism is about equality. Sure, be a men's right's activist- even though \nfeminism literally already is trying to deal with those same issues- but \nfuck off with your anti-feminism because all feminists want is equality and \nyou labeling us as over-emotional nutcases is a) not going to progress your \nmovement at all and b) just a really shitty thing to do like what kind of \nhuman is so against all people being treated as equals that they dedicate \ntheir entire lives to it.

The criticism of him though would be an inconsistency in what \nhe writes, forgetting about that article then trying to palm it off as \nsomething long along. People below may take issue with that line of \nquestioning from the VICE reporter, but get over it.\n\nThe Honey Badger radio program by Karen Straughan is something interesting, \nmy problem would be that is her arguments going to be just skewering \nfeminism or actually making change for true equality and fighting for men's \nrights. She says \"My name is Karen, I am an anti-feminist and I don't give \na shit.\" The counter to that is \"Your name is Karen, your an anti-feminist \nbut why should we give a shit?\" The evolution of the movement i feel needs \nto grow from the black panther type activism into something mainstream \npeople can't wave off as extremism masquerading as respectable discourse.\n\nThe challenge is also on those criticising them to be open minded to the \nfact not everyone in the MRM are\n misogynists or sexists, avoid the aggressive slander that was shown. \nHowever i call bullshit that VICE was positioning Lizzie Bonicatti, the \nsole opponent to the MRM conference featured as a victim.\n\nClearly the conference organizers changed their minds about letting her in. \nShe was thought of as a trouble maker and is left in position of being the \nlone protester mocked by the speakers on the way to the building. Also she \nsaid no other feminists would join her because it wasn't a good use of \ntheir time, so she more of a sad voice flailing in the wind rather than a \nvictim picked on by the MRM here.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13evtyj2tvqzlbws04cc3xw0mrshzv4el00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClL4jYLupIrgoACMeYMRW1w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i0QlT4CGZHE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/nj19sYAovCQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.90497737556561086, "authorDisplayName": "Jimmie Rustles", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-13T08:12:18.194Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UClL4jYLupIrgoACMeYMRW1w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.70840999999999998, "formal_score": 10, "updatedAt": "2015-03-13T08:12:18.194Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116402727998528770370", "textDisplay": " \nThe reason why people hate feminism is not because of some overarching \nsence of hatred of women but because feminists keep making asses of \nthemselves over and over again.\n\nIm not saying that smart feminists dont exist ,hell they do but they seem \nto be a diying species.\nFeminism has been taken over by inveciles using feminism as an excuse to \ncomplain about their mundanne and pointless vikering and a safehaven for \nman hating women and self hating men triying desperately to look \u201ccool\u201d \ninfront of the girls.\n\nFeminism is poisonous and it will continue being so unless the smart \nfeminists step up and that is not happening...not even close.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13qhxabupm1hfc5t04cinarhpvrhntxkj0": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC82PNZBJloyPnX590HcVoeQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-7l7JDuvQRqc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADJE/XZa8chfaW3o/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "lizzie grosso", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-25T20:16:37.833Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC82PNZBJloyPnX590HcVoeQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.98803574999999999, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-07-25T20:16:37.833Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117796352878966051624", "textDisplay": "what rights do these white, heterosexual males, not have ????,\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipDbJpVqLvpA0qJ3sGCeXg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Graham Mikkelson", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qhxabupm1hfc5t04cinarhpvrhntxkj0", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-11T00:39:55.914Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCipDbJpVqLvpA0qJ3sGCeXg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.90555249999999998, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-11T00:39:55.914Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-h1fFwt9lX58/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAL8/0TDEjhGwBbI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117416771105198265168", "textDisplay": "The right not to have my genitals mutilated as an infant.

I came from a very \ndysfunctional, violent family which played a small part in the building of \nour current dictatorships. I have also worked as a journalist. I know the \nsysem is rotten and corrupt and chancers use it to further their own slimy \naims and goals, be they lawyers or scummy political vampires. However, \nasking for the same is no solution. We have to accept that people wish \ncertain female privileges to exist and these were traditionally balanced by \nwomen being controlled and restricted in many other ways. That has broken \ndown now and the result is obvious to all who would look to see it. Many \nfeminists have trouble seeing this.\nWe cannot, in the name of justice, go on like this. All western societies \nare suffering from the identity crisis of our restricting/freeing women. \nSubtle changes are everywhere to be seen in the public policy process and \nstem from activists like MRAs doing their work on-line, lobbying and \n'justice' concerns.. However, read history and particularly the history of \npublic policy and you will see that this strength is a weakness in the long \nrun. Social policy needs to be simple and based almost wholly on justice \ntowards individuals, be they men or women. This needs to be combined with \nan acceptance of the world as it is; imperfect.\nWe know what works in economics; giving women ability to compete with men \nin open and free economies. We also know what does not work in economics; \nrestricting and controlling women. Where women cannot compete, the economy \nis shit. Look at wealthy Europe and US and compare them to the neighbours - \nwhere cultural restrictions on women depress neighbouring Latin American or \nAsian or African economies. This causes massive immigration and \ninstability. We pump aid to these countries to help shore up their \ntreatment of women which helps keep their economies weak. Its not a \nconspiracy, it's just plain stupidity in the policy process because people \nbelieve when problems arise something should be done. We need to grow up \nand believe that when nothing can be done, do nothing or move ahead very \ncautiously. Currently, activists are asking us to tolerate their treatment \nof women in our societies. They call this tolerance and say it has to be \nimposed on us in the name of justice. Tolerance is now imposed, not done by \npeople accepting the things they do not approve of? What's going on?\nIn order to respect another's negative right not to be hit, I do not hit \nthem. This is simple and all can understand it. Sense and justice has \nbroken down because people wish to futher complicate the system in the name \nof 'justice'. Lawyers and political vampires are the only ones who will win \nin the long run.\n\n\nFinally, a movement will always be judged by its most extreme or egregious \nmembers. Think of feminism and picture the mentally unstable rape and \ndomination fantasist Andrea Dworkin or Solanas or the deluded Brownmillars, \nJeffries or Mackinnons. The rape and domination fantasy that is feminism is \njudged by the worst of its rape and domination fantasists. Do you really \nbelieve men's rights will be any different? I am willing to bet there are \nmore nutty and exotic characters in men's rights politics than there are in \nfeminist politics. The reason we are not seeing masses of them at the \nmoment, is the lack of tax-payers' cash chucked at the issue, unlike in \nfeminism which is funded by the alleged patriarchal state. However, sadly \nthat is changing as lobbying continues and claims are made. Men's follies \nwill not be hidden from them in the way they are hidden from women, even \nloons like Dworkin benefitted from this. This is a cultural thing in the \nwest and to expect equality in this is bordering on the absurd.\nWe can however agree on the statement: Death to feminism!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mentalidade Logica", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ev1b4llamjxvqs04ccvlhssfmcfcgf0s", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-01T22:03:57.033Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.71246399999999999, "formal_score": 95, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-01T22:04:34.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Iovrm_3Dd98/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/7rxb8F34Feo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110971639976441621198", "textDisplay": "+mudpuddlestruck bylightning \nAwareness is the first step towards fixing problems. \nThat is precisely what you refer to as MRAs are doing, I see nothing wrong \nwith it.\nYour point is valid when, more appropriately if such groups have the same \nor equivalent advocacy power as feminism does -but that is not the case."}}]}, "z12jtldbyo3cw1ley22cgxw55li5s1giq04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYCfPYxN4aUBEZtTSX6qFw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-On43Lnd7cEU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXg/Lrp8ie0hR78/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Class Punk", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-04T07:14:34.545Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLYCfPYxN4aUBEZtTSX6qFw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.91073150000000003, "formal_score": 11, "updatedAt": "2014-12-04T07:15:18.000Z", "likeCount": 6, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103604488587121361366", "textDisplay": "The Men's Rights Movement isn't radical enough in its tone and message;

The best way to solve problems is not adopting one side or another, \nbut rather making EGALITARIAN based groups that focus on taking down the \none true oppressor that is gender roles IN GENERAL.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12bhduh1lumepbma22yzxoqvvjqzvo02": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEg8xEbiY3lk4IDNO-Wg0EQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Samuel McDermott", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-02T03:04:40.711Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEg8xEbiY3lk4IDNO-Wg0EQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.077884000000000009, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-04-02T03:04:40.711Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105095521876883891667", "textDisplay": "I stopped watching when the guy said \"why isn't there birth control for \nmen\".. bruhhh\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z123tfgxipb1shox004cexhhbvrceztbfnc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpQUgURJQPJgh0Bh4N5TjxQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZmI4zghvkFw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACJQ/QIUUFRXP2RM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jeffrey Poitras", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-27T04:32:14.154Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCpQUgURJQPJgh0Bh4N5TjxQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.91779959999999994, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2015-07-27T04:32:14.154Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101990346971103166356", "textDisplay": "If anything i think that the word feminism is corrupt and at this point it \nshould just be called gender equality because isn't that the most equal \nthing to call it?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13rht34eyyljf0pt04cf5spalupjjchcuw0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClW_PMgaT8hpPneHrNPc2sw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4dQwY2LGRhc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/tVMYlqm60TY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "King Green", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-02T02:51:37.767Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UClW_PMgaT8hpPneHrNPc2sw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.13664399999999999, "formal_score": 20, "updatedAt": "2014-11-02T02:51:37.767Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109165778083343799528", "textDisplay": "backwards hostile philosophy. all i can say is \"good luck\", lol\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z120dzbgokvnxdqvn23nuxwb0mj3ildcy": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChlRKrhpqBTy0c0_7_OXXXA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bHeQ_DV85-Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADg/CcRsOIuBI8Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Gregory Boons", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-10T11:25:37.635Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UChlRKrhpqBTy0c0_7_OXXXA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.061819999999999986, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-12-10T11:25:37.635Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107010243623624606793", "textDisplay": "I think Elam needs to be more clear on what he writes, tone is hard to get \nacross through text.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z133z3vboxv1erp3d23qd32rkm2rib5aj04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiLTpiXQd1nP13a4MJuTW_A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yp74_Yt7z1w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABwc/wyYzRK9cLiM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 3.4482758620689653, "authorDisplayName": "Boo Radley", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-16T00:45:29.026Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCiLTpiXQd1nP13a4MJuTW_A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.81685629999999998, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-11-16T00:45:29.026Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118175749375857226080", "textDisplay": " So....... they think it is fine for a man to fuck a girl while she is \npassed out if she drank?

(I \ndon't condone any abuse, just to be clear) I mean, she outright lied in \nseveral instances, got over a mil for what amounts to essentially lying \nabout games, and painting all gamers as vile womanhaters. Yeah, that is \nbasically begging for abuse.\nAnd the shooting-threat wasn't deemed credible because in all likelihood it \nwas written by a 14 y/o throwing a tantrum. Even so, threatening to shoot \nup a meeting is beyond unacceptable.\nAs for the amount of abuse Anita has gotten over her, she could've at least \nexpected that if you go lie about something that could be called \"world's \nfavourite past-time\" or \"world's biggest entertainment sector\", and then \ndisable comments, disable ratings. People will be frustrated, and direct \nthat frustration at her directly instead of the comments-sections. I'm not \nsaying that she asked for it, but she could've avoided it if she had \nthought it through a bit.\n\nyeah, that Christina Sommers, but I also mentioned Cathy Young, and I can \nname a few others, but she calls herself an equity feminist, and she indeed \ndoes work for the rights of women where they fall short, so feminist in my \nbook at the very least.\nHer work with the AEI or Prager University is also very accessible, and \nreadily available for those who are interested. I'd highly encourage a read \nof it if you ever feel like exploring different strains of feminism.\n\nAnd believe it or not, Gamergate has not recieved just 1 but over 11 \nCredible bomb-threats. the Gamergate meetup in DC got a bomb-threat and \nthey had to evacuate. and then there's the SPJ-airplay where there were 2 \nshort of a dozen credible bombthreats. In both instances the buildings had \nto be evacuated, and it's documented in real-time at the end of the \nSPJairplay youtube video. just google \"Gamergate meetup DC\" and \"SPJairplay \nbombthreat\"\n\nAs for gamergate being misogyny wrapped in a decore of journalistic \nintegrity, I've been keeping tabs on gamergate from the sideline, and they \ndo indeed seem to very much only care about the journalistic integrity. \nThey even call people out who have crossed the line and sent even a mildly \nabusive message. (basically just being excessively rude)\nI mean, why would they go to the Society of Proffesional Journalists if \nthey just wanted to hate on women? And more over, why on earth would they \nselect Christina Sommers, Milo Yianopolis, and Cathy Young to be \nrepresentatives for them in the event if they were trying to bully women in \nthe entertainment industry?\nAnd what about Gamergate's sister-hashtag #notyourshield? In which \nthousands of women came forth, showed their face and alligned with \nGamergate's striving for ethics in gaming-journalism?\nNot to mention that there are a lot of 3d party trolls aggrivating both \nsides around this issue.\n\nIf you look past the trolls, and really look into gamergate, you might be \nsurprised at what you find. I could recommend a few vids on youtube about \ngamergate from the inside, if you're interested. At the very least, it's a \nhighly interesting sociological case-study.\n\nAs for Paul Elam, and his Ilk? They're crass, they're insulting and more \noften than not come off as complete asses. But what about Warren Farrell? \nHe's an MRA. What about the Honey Badger Brigade? Karen Straughan, Hannah \nWallen, and that bunch? They're also MRA's, and they're v\u00e9ry on point.\n\nAlso; I want to make a distinction real quick:\nThere's MRA's, MGTOW, \"Pick-up artists\" and Anti-feminists, and while there \nis overlap there, they are not the same.\nThose terms are in a similar position as the terms Feminist, Social Justice \nWarrior, Female Supremacist and Misandrist. There is distinction there.\nMRA's are a form of male feminist, and they fight for the rights that men \nare falling behind in when compared to women.\nMGTOW are basically men who no longer care about relationships, and who \nseek to understand the world on their terms.\nPickup-artists are sleezy people who try to use female instincts and \nword-play to lure women into sex. (and I fucking revile them for their \ndishonesty)\nAnd then there's the anti-feminists, who simply oppose feminism.\nWhile I can understand that people don't like Paul Elam, there are other \nalternatives, and Paul is far from the only voice in this conversation.

She gives talk after talk about how \nshe's a victim of a hatemob, but what has she actually produced that is of \npropper intellectual merit? \"Tropes VS women\" is ridden with \ncherry-picking, decietfull editing and outright lies. I do not, however, \ncondone some of the things she's had to endure, but she wears it like a big \nsign to show how much of a victim she is.\nI am honestly even having a rather hard time seeing her as anything else \nbut a con-artist. (and I can substantiate that if you want)\n\n\nI've heard the name of Bell Hooks a few times, but haven't looked into her \n(I will after this), so I won't contradict you on that, because that would \nbe arguing from ignorance, and that is something I prefer not to do.\n\nBut, if I were to call a name that I think are good feminists, that I'd be \nproud to stand alongside of are Christina Sommers or Cathy Young. They are \ngood moderate Feminists, that I deeply respect. In no small parte due to \ntheir stance on the whole \"Rape culture\" idea. They don't play victims when \nthey are criticised and they have endured actually credible bomb-threats. \n(C. Sommers during a Gamergate meetup, and during the SPJAirplay, and C. \nYoung was also present at the Airplay-event) and they took it in strides. \n\nand can you name a number of MRA's that are horrible? specifically name \nthem, or any specific problems you can't take serious? I'm honestly asking \nhere.\n\nSo far, I'm really enjoying this conversation, I must say.\n\n((edit))\nI've looked up some stuff on Bell Hooks, read a few paragraphs of the Book \nFeminism is for Everybody, and I can't say I'm particularly impressed. She \nuses a lot of fallacy's (No true scottsman's fallacy being the most \nprominent) and she sounds a bit too culty. And from what I can gather, Bell \nHooks also has a thing for the \"White male patriarchy\", for which I've \nactually yet to see any evidence, and goes into the pile of \n\"not-substantiated claims\"\nGood things about Feminism is for everybody is that it's an easy \ncomprehensive read, from what I've read so far.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, really, Patriarchy theory, and all of it's \nconstituents would first have to evidence their claims, because I'm not \nbuying it, and it's basically the fundamental aspect of modern-day \nfeminism. So before I can even consider any feminist argument that wants to \nuse patriarchy for something, they will first need to show me the \npatriarchy without resorting to any fallacy.

As for ethics - \"Feminist Ethics is an \nattempt to revise, reformulate, or\nrethink traditional ethics to the extent it depreciates or devalues\nwomen's moral experience. Among others, feminist philosopher Alison\nJaggar faults traditional ethics for letting women down in five\nrelated ways. First, it shows less concern for women's as opposed to\nmen's issues and interests.

It \nopposed pornography, and it also opposed transwomen; it was mostly a \nreaction to women's social role in cold war era \"western world\"; they \nanyway achieved some stuff on the legal plain.\n3rd wave feminism (since the 90's) is structuralist influenced \n(structuralism is an academic movement that opposes positivism by focusing \nin structures rather than uninterpreted content; examples are lacanian \npsychoanalysis and semiotic literary criticism) and focuses mostly on \nnon-formal women issues (those problems that are not a direct consequence \nof written law), like sexual abuse, mysoginy, reproduction. It opposes 2nd \nwave feminism, mostly on debates about sex and sexuality depiction (2nd \nwave somehow think sex and pornography are degrading to women; 3rd wave \nsays sex it's good and healthy as long as the people involved want to do \nit, they're also pro-porn); and also on the subject of transexualism (2nd \nwave believes transwoman are men trying to \"steal\" women's place; 3rd wave \nbelieves genitals do not play a magic part in the social and political life \nof a person, but only, and marginally, when having sex, therefore they \nsupport transexuals).\nSo, FEMINISM IS NOT AN IDEOLOGY, but a lot of different, and sometimes \ncompletely opposite, ideologies (be it bourgeois representative democracy, \nclassical marxism, biological determinism, structuralism, post-modernist \ndeconstruction), all wrapped up in a political women's movement. The goal \nof feminism (at least current 3rd wave) IS NOT to impose a monolythic \nmen-hating ideology, an idea that people keep repeating hoping it will \nsomeday become true, but to allow women to self-represent themselves \npolitically (following a broad, non-formal, definition of politics as \"any \nattempt by a determined subject directed at the conciliation of its \nobjective material conditions and its subjective ideological conditions\").\nThat's what feminism IS. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism is a good source \nfor reading about this.

Its so hard to get anyone sent to jail for rape in \nthe united states and many people struggle with this but they wouldn't know \nany of this because they haven't been through it they are doing what there \nmom always told them not to they are judging a book by its cover. And on \nanother note I am not pro man nor women I am pro equal. Men and women \nshouldn't get bashed over stuff like this. They set at there stand talking \nabout how women get birth control for sex and men don't get anything like \nthat so they are made to use condoms. First of all they sound like winey \nbitches picking at a stupid problem. Women get birth control so they don't \nhave to carry around a baby for 9 months when they aren't ready and birth \ncontrol is also to help a women's period something that men can't \nunderstand and don't have to live with. Men get erection pills something \nthat women don't get and can't understand and they use them to help sex \ndrive and performance .men and women both have there faults and differences \nbut we shouldn't set in groups and bash each other over it we should try to \nunderstand eachother. male nor female should dominate we should use our \ndifferent traits to work together. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zw105bvv4x33hx04cdpihjkeoerb4jdc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf-lfkpTd_4LN0bOmSg6TWg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MRwM24lSdpU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/hP8D92277yo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.4925373134328359, "authorDisplayName": "Natalia Rivera", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-29T16:19:58.857Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCf-lfkpTd_4LN0bOmSg6TWg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.86689970000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-05-29T16:19:58.857Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105253010866728379332", "textDisplay": "wow its actually quite sad how ignorant these peeps are.

RAPE IS NOT A JOKE, rape \nshould never be a joke, and they even talk about how rape within a marriage \nisn't something that happens, and even if it is how could it happen so \noften. You're in a marriage, you know this person, of course they could \nnever rape you..

I understand that the \ntitle of this video is misleading, but they do mention rape a couple of \ntimes and each time they write it off and don't see that it has lasting \neffects that are harmful and detrimental to the health and well being of \nwoman.

Its a well established fact that most of \ntoday's felons came from a single mother household. Why is this? Because a \nmale role model is lacking. How would this be different for a gay couple? \nSure you have 2 parents, BUT they are both the same gender so in the end \nstill only one gender will be represented in the kid`s life to act as a \nrole model. This IMO is not a balanced upbringing like you would get from a \ntraditional family with a mother and father, female and male and would \nprobably lead to the same problems later in life as is the case with single \nparent households. With that being said, this already shows that men and \nwomen both bring something different to the table where child rearing is \nconcerned and shows the neccesity of \"gender roles\" within the family \natmosphere.\n\nIts funny that you bring up the right to have kids.

In this scenario the father has \nno right or say at all about the future of his child, even though the baby \ngrows inside the mother it is still half his, physically, legally and \nemotionally.

So \nhow in your enlightened opinion did feminism create equality in this \nsituation?\n\nIf women are as capable as men at every job, why do we have affirmative \naction in place? Why do we for example have different fitness tests for \nmales and females to qualify to get into the military where women have to \npass a way lower mark than men? Where is your equality in family court \nwhere men rarely win child custody because of the bias against men? I could \ngo on forever but i think you get the gist.\n\nYou still seem to believe in the classic feminist propaganda and textbook \ndefinition on Feminism when in reality its not progressive movement that \nwants to promote equality for all but rather takes the rights away from one \ngroup and gives it to the other in turn not addressing imbalance but rather \ncreating a larger imbalance.

It's not, if you do come to developing countries, you'd see \nthat they focus more on these kind of issues than what people in yours are. \nIt's not right to form an opinion based on the websites and videos that's \nagainst feminism and what you've seen in your country.\"\n\n+TragedyStrikes \n\"I speak about them in countries such as the US and the UK and other \ndeveloped countries.\nI don't want to hear the justification for feminism being women suffering \nfrom issues in other countries because most of the time they only bring \nthem up to promote feminism regardless of the fact they do very little in \ncomparison to prevent those issues as they do first world issues.  Everyone \nknows that less developed countries are shitty for women and men.\"\n\n----------------\n\nSo you're basically agreeing with each other, but still speaking through \neach other because you're not actually talking within the same dimension of \nthis... You're both right, but that doesn't mean your argument outweighs \nthe other in terms of your respective perspectives. Fathmath Nadar needs to \nacknowledge that TragedyStrikes speaks about first world feminism. \nTragedyStrikes has already acknowledged that other parts of the world have \nless female rights (I assume).\n\nHowever i have to side with TragedyStrikes on almost all of his arguments \nsince the topic and video was about inequality in the first world, except \nfor the 1. wage gap (in a sense) and 2.:\n\n1. I do believe that the countries that allow women to work up towards the \nsame positions as males should have equal salary, and that the problem is \nan underlying thing with how the women are (the sad truth) different than \nmen that makes them less capable of the same labour as men. \n\nYou're right about this, but i also think Fathmath has forgot or doesn't \nknow about the underlying factor that most professions and companies (even \nin the first world) doesn't allow the women to continue whilst being \npregnant and after having their child. There are less welfare benefits and \nthey would struggle to get back into working life. Some countries like \nScandinavia does not have this problem to the extent i believe US has.\n\nIf i have to mention an example its the \"Shufu\" culture Japan has for \ninstance. Its inequal, but its a cultural thing that heavily involves in \ndisregarding womens physiology. I do understand why these companies do this \nand its a consequence of capitalism rather than inequality directly. \nHowever i find it equally laughable that some women still dare say that \nthey are equal to men in terms of biology. They must've lived in a cave.\n\n2. \"The reason for this is that, for a man, he has to earn his frequent \nsexual experiences.  He must either be charming, rich, have status, and or \npower, among other things.  For women all they have to do is ask and \nthey'll get it\"\n\n\nWomen very often get the same feeling as the men. I'm not sure how it is in \nthe US (but i would wage it would be a US problem), but in Europe as well \nas Asia, there are boys that looks so dashingly that they give up even \nthough they feel an attraction. Its the same mentality of: The person is \ntoo good for me, i'll never charm the person how i am. I have met girls \nwho've had this personally.\n\nTherefore its not a matter of equality discussion, but rather about the \nperson itself, personality and romance problems. Of course both can get sex \nquite easily, but thats not the discussion. How people regard the person \nwould also be a cultural thing, i have no problems knowing a girl has slept \nwith 20 boys as with knowing a guy that has slept with none in his life \ntill he died at an age of 60 (wizard). Thats how life is and has been, and \nif the interpretation of how one is regarded as a male/female is \ninequality, then i say its a problem not worth discussing.\n\nYou are what you make yourself to be. I have seen what has been regarded \nugly on both genders, but still manage to establish a relationship.\n\n--------------\n\nOn the other hand as much as i don't like feminisms turn in this \ngeneration, i can't say i'm amused by what the MRM people have said in this \ndocumentary.

I really don't get it.\n\nI like to think that if I was a woman, I would want to be expected to have \nthe same amount of responsibility than a man. Because if not it would seems \nhypocrite to ask to be considered as an equal.\n\nI know that there is other way to teach responsibility but it seems that at \nevery turn woman are expected to be less and less responsable.\n\nfor exemple:\nWoman have absolute controle of contraception. And it is good that way, it \nis in fact the only way (you can't force a woman to get pregnant and you \ncan't force her to abort or prevent her to do so).\nthat being say why it is that a man can't opt out from a unwanted child (at \nleast during the first few weeks when abortion is still an option) I mean \nit is clearly the responsability of the woman to be sure not to get \npregnant before making sure that either the man is also up for it or if she \nwant, that she can deal with it by herself.\n\nwhy is that discussion a taboo? and no I'm not advocating for man to have \nno responsibility at all. but if it is her choice and her choice only why a \nman would have to paid for her choice? do you see where i am getting at?\n\nAnd yeah I know that being a single parent is a hard job. but this day \nbeing a parent is a choice for the woman still not for the man.\n\nWhy is that if a girl is drunk, have sexe and regret it the next day it s \nsexual assault but not the other way around? of course being drunk didn't \nmean consent but regretting it the next day didn't mean rape. Bad decision \nmaking is a symptom of being drunk, it come with the territory. If you old \nenough to drink and to have sexe you old enough to know that. and unless \nyou was to drunk to walk or talk (and in this case yes it is rape and you \nshould go to the police they will take it serously) and you give consent \nthen the only one to blame is you and the shitty friends you was with for \nnot slapping some sense into your head when you decide to follow the \nasshole to his place.\n\nI understant that this kind of situation may be a bigger \"trauma\" for a \ngirl but then it's your responsability to be more careful with who you \ninteract with and for not placing yourself in a position of vulnerability.\n\nwhy is false rape accusation never being taken seriously?\nI do understand that a grey area exist in this matter and yeah it is \nimportant that the victim of a sexual assault feel no fear of not being \ntaken seriously or even worst to be charged for false accusation in a case \nlike that.\nbut why in all this cases when it is just malicious lies make publicly? \nthis cases have serious consequence for the victims even if not convicted. \nand yet no consequence are taken against the perpetrator of said false \naccusation.\n\nwhy is this sentencing gap?\nwhy is this than when convicted the sentence are shorter?\n\nI am not trying to be a dick here. and I know that it is poorly written and \nconfused that why I usually don't post comment but you seems to be open \nminded to a discussion so this is my piece of thinking.\n\nEdit: some bad typo"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDcQUoqjuGHLrFfQAbx5PbQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TragedyStrikes", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13pthlwnsfvxvsps04cizao5sylxteac4g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-01T15:07:02.911Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDcQUoqjuGHLrFfQAbx5PbQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.73173200000000005, "formal_score": 8, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-01T15:07:02.911Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vANVv1_-1BY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAN8/GyrB_B1Jvms/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113508291068306005626", "textDisplay": "+NuChannel1142\n Great contribution to the discussion.

If you're talking about developed countries then why are you \nbringing up men being drafted into this?  The ONLY developed country that \ndoes this is Israel and in Israel both men AND women are drafted. However, \nwomen are drafted for 2 years + reserve duty every year for a month until \nthe age of 54 and men are drafted for 3 years with the same reserve duty. \nThat's unfair but still, not only men are drafted.\n\n\"I find this hilariously hypocritical as you are condoning such a thing \nwith the simple answer of \"it's their culture\" and telling me I have to \nrespect that culture just because it is not my own.  I do not have to \nrespect any other culture.  Just because it's different does not mean I \nhave to condone what other cultures do.\"\nMaybe I shouldn't have said culture, I said it only once. By culture I mean \nreligion. You can change culture but you can't change religion. I'm saying \nthat if male circumcision was made illegal, then a lot of people with these \nkinds of religious beliefs would be furious. \nAlso, you have completely ignored what I said about female circumcision \nbeing worse than male circumcision, does that mean you at least agree with \nthat? \nAnd honestly, I don't understand why you're complaining so much the \nbenefits of male circumcision outweigh the risks. You can't prevent people \nfrom dying, why can't we just make all surgeries illegal then bc it kills \npeople? \nIf you circumcise men, there is less risk of urinary tract infections, less \nrisk of some sexually transmitted diseases in men, full protection against \npenile cancer and a reduced risk of cervical cancer in female sex partners,\nprevention of balanitis (inflammation of the glans) and balanoposthitis \n(inflammation of the glans and foreskin), prevention of phimosis (the \ninability to retract the foreskin) and paraphimosis (the inability to \nreturn the foreskin to its original location). \nIts all here: http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/guide/circumcision\nNow, female circumcision is done mostly to ensure that women do not have \nsex before marriage, this is the reason in Middle East anyway. And there \nare absolutely no benefits to female circumcision, only risks.\nHere: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/\nAnd both of these are not sites about feminism, but about health, you \ncan''t just say that the facts are wrong because of your opinion.\n\n\"That said, all the things you bring up that women go through in less \ndeveloped countries can then be refuted as a non-issue simply by saying \nthat you must respect that culture because it's part of their religion and \nculture.  Doesn't seem fair, does it?  That's what you just done in regards \nto circumcision.\"\nAgain, I said culture, my mistake. I meant religion. \n1. There is nothing against women driving or voting in Islam, this is just \nbecause of gender stereotypes. Many Muslim women around the world do drive \nand have the right to vote, it's just this country.\n2. Killing of girl babies are not part of a religion\n3. The thing about 2 women = 1 man is formed because of how the women acted \naround the time of the religion. Women have changed, they are more \noutspoken as even considered as intellectual as men in a lot of parts of \nthe world. And if you consider this, then there is another way in the \nreligion for this issue. Our problem is that a lot of Muslim countries are \nrefusing to acknowledge this. Again, gender stereotypes.\n4. Again, a woman not getting an education is not part of the religion, it \nis actually advisable that women do go to schools and learn as much \npossible in quite a lot of religions.\n5. The religion I am talking about when it comes to not allowing sex before \nmarriage is Islam, again. Not because I am Muslim but because I live in a \nMuslim country. Not allowing DNA evidence when it is perfectly accurate is \nNOT in the religion. And allowing a man to get away when the woman is \nwhipped is also not in the religion. A woman getting raped, then whipped is \nalso not in the religion. But do we do rape kits, no. It's not about \nreligion, it's about power.\n6. Abortion is most definitely not supported in most widely-believed \nreligions. But the issues are still there, and if the person really \nbelieved in religion then they wouldn't consider abortion. But allow \nabortions to those who want it instead of making it completely illegal, is \nall I'm saying.\n7. Child marriages do happen in the UK and US btw, it's just not very \npublicized. And also, not in religion. Islam for one, says child marriage \nis better because the \"uncontrollable\" hormones will lead to sex before \nmarriage. Therefore, girls are told to be married right after their \nmenstruation begins. It not prohibited in the religion to get an education \nbefore getting married, or wait till after 18 as long as the woman or man \ndoesn't have sex. So, not compulsory.\nTherefore, this argument is invalid.\n\n\"The reason for this is that, for a man, he has to earn his frequent sexual \nexperiences.  He must either be charming, rich, have status, and or power, \namong other things.  For women all they have to do is ask and they'll get \nit\"\nOh please, this goes both ways. \nAll this rich, status, power, being charming thing is for people who have a \nlot of standards but don't have the standards that the women or men they \ndesire want. That's just the harsh truth. A woman who doesn't look \nattractive, doesn't have the personality, doesn't have status or money, \nwill usually not get men that have all that. You target a specific kind of \nwomen or men and then you complain about how men or women who actually do \nmeet their standards get the person?\nAnd honestly, that's not all a man can have. They don't need to have all \nthat if they're attractive. Even women have sex with men who they are \nattracted to, regardless whether they try to charm her with hsi personality \nor not. This goes for men as well. \n\"They're way out of your league.\" This whole situation is why people say \nthis. I'm not saying this is fair. I'm jut saying that this is how it is.\n\n\"Your wage gap argument makes no sense.  The wage gap is not limited to \npositions of power.  Men still make more on average than women even without \naccounting for leadership positions.  So your argument that women don't do \nso because they don't feel welcome in leadership positions has no relevance \nbecause the wage gap still exists in positions that aren't leadership \nroles.\"\nI was responding to these 2 points when i was talking about leadership and \nill respond to them again disregarding leadership positions.\n- Men gravitate towards higher paying and riskier jobs than women on \naverage.\nI assume by riskier jobs you mean firefighters, police work, etc?\nHave you ever wondered why women don't gravitate towards these positions?\nThey're not as physically strong as men. Society doesn't view women doing \nthese jobs in a very nice way because a lot of people believe that jobs \nlike this are made for men because of their physical capabilities compared \nto women.  \n- Men negotiate for higher paying salaries far more than women on average.\nHigher paying salaries does mean more leadership, so my point is a bit \nrelevant to this one. But I want to see where you got all this information \nfrom, where are the facts?\n\n\"If you're saying women can't handle leadership positions because men \ngravitated to those positions more and before women did, then you're \nessentially saying women are too emotionally and mentally immature to aim \nfor positions men gravitate to.  Regardless, you're wrong.  The fact that \nthere are women in positions of power illustrates that women can be in \npositions of power. \nIf women don't want to be in positions of power because men more often are, \nthen that's their own emotional and mental issue, and that's their own \nproblem, because nobody is stopping them from being in those positions.\"\nI was not saying that, I said that women feel like, I didn't say that they \nwere not capable of. It's like how the upbringing of a child affects how \nthey see the world as they're older. From what they see, what they hear, \nwhat's frowned upon and what's not, expectations and not meeting them. All \nof this and more affect how people's views change as they're older. Just \nlike how a man is told to be brave and strong and not give away their \nfeelings, even in tough times ever since they're a child. This affects how \nmen act, the suicide rates, the crime rates, they're all more men. And one \nof the reasons given by these people are that they just need to get all \nthese bottled up feelings out.  Would you call this their own emotional and \nmental issue? That they caused this themselves? no. I mean obviously even \nif men are criticized and pressured, it is still their own fault for not \nopening up to people, right? This is what you sound like to me, it's absurd.\nAnyway, just like that, a woman sees all these men in leadership positions, \nall these people telling her, and yes this does happen, that men can \ncontrol these kind of situations better. These situations do affect women's \nminds and I speak from experience. There are all these  positions that have \nbeen opened for me as well, but there is always that part in my head that \nsays I can't do it. I don't mean it to happen, but it does. I actually \nrealized this happens after turning down around 5 positions and then I \nresearched. Of course a lot of women have supportive parents, teachers and \nfriends. But in every community, there will always be those people who \ndisagree. And these people influence us as well. Those women who are \nmotivated by people around them do go for leadership positions and do \nsucceed, but as of right now, I'm not being very motivated and so is a lot \nof other women. There are women who take the women in leadership positions \nas examples, but with the criticism they receive from close family or \nfriends, they give up. I've seen this happen as well. \n\n\"You then go in to telling me that a woman that is looking after her \nchildren and their house as well as having a job has a tough life.  Well, \nthat's their problem.  It's nobody elses fault if a woman chose to have \nchildren, a job, and a home.  If the man is not there then she can sue for \nchild support to then hire a nanny.  If the father is there and does \nnothing, then she has the choice to divorce him and get child support or \ntake joint custody for the father to look after the children.  If the man \nis there and works more than the woman, then it's understandable that she \nwould have more responsibility at home, as the man is working more and \nearning more for the family.\"\nThe pressure thing goes for this as well, women are more pressured to take \ncare of family than men. People consider it more a woman's responsibility \nthan a man's. And honestly, not everyone has the guts to displease the \ncommunity and not meet their expectations okay, you might. But a lot of \npeople are scared to do so, scared for lack of acceptance and having hate \ndirected at them. Honestly, even you need to be more understanding of that \npoint, this is human nature. A lot of people are afraid of getting a bad \nreputation. And sometimes ditching their kids and going for jobs gets you \nexactly that. Especially if you're in a community filled with women who \ndecide not to go to work as they feel like it's their god given purpose or \njust because they prefer to look after the house and take care of the \nchildren while getting financial aid from the husband or the father of her \nchildren.\nYou realize that in some countries, it's extremely hard for women to get a \ndivorce, right? Especially countries that register the status of the \npeople. Men in some countries only have to say \"I divorce you\" to separate \nfrom their wives. That is it. Then they just need to inform the court \noffice that the male and female have gotten a divorce. However, women need \nto give the men a price to get divorced, sometimes when men don't accept \nthe price, women have to take them to court. There is no other way. I will \nalso mention that the courts of these countries are extremely busy and \nwomen usually have to wait around a month to actually get the divorce. Have \nyou not heard of this? This isn't equality either.\nI'm just saying that not all countries have these choices that you have, \nbut a lot of you take them for granted. I'm not wrong about that.\n\nAlso, you're over reading into the definition. A compliment is a \ncompliment. I know that. But starting off by body shape, size of my ass and \nboobs. That's not how you start a conversation, it makes a person feel \nuncomfortable immediately. At least start slow, wtf. People can say I look \npretty today, that's okay, I don't mind.\nI've also noticed that some men, and even after I have dismissed the \ncomment, they would keep doing it to the point where I feel uncomfortable. \nI mean, if I've dismissed it, then take it as me not being interested. I'm \nnot going to directly say no, I won't have sex with you for compliments \nokay, but it will lead to that in these kind of situations.\nLastly, I would not consider them asking and accepting rejection as sexual \nharassment. Like if the person goes away after I say no, then fine, that's \nokay. But if a person keeps nagging afterwards then it is most definitely \nnot okay. \nThis is what I mean by unwelcome sexual advances or sexual favors. At most \nthree times is okay, but continuing to ask the same kinds of questions \nafter I say no, I would consider THAT as sexual harassment.\n \nI understand now that women also sexually harass men in your country, I get \nthat. But I have never seen it in mine nor heard of it. I even produced an \nanonymous questionnaire for about 300 men from different age groups. Almost \nall of them have said no, that they have not faced any kind of sexual \nharassment. And before you say that maybe they don't know the meaning of \nsexual harassment, I also asked what they consider as seual harassment. And \nmost of them said touching and grabbing of your private parts and constant \ncomments about your body that make you feel uncomfortable or sexually \ntargeted.  They know, it just doesn't happen to them as much.\nBut in my country, in the case of girls, there are girls who have not gone \nout one single time in the past 6 years without being sexually harassed. \nCat-calling, touching, grabbing, etc. And these women do develop a hatred \nfor men, not all of them, but a lot. And I wouldn't blame them for it, \nneither would I blame a man who has developed a hatred for women because of \nconstant sexual harassment. And so I apologize for being inconsiderate and \nignorant on this topic, but in my mind I thought I had perfect reasoning to \nbelieve what I did. \n\nIn conclusion,\nI understand that a lot of the feminists in your country are still \ncomplaining about rights that they have already gotten, but you cannot just \nlook at your country and say woah this is feminism all over the world, \nguys. It's not, if you do come to developing countries, you'd see that they \nfocus more on these kind of issues than what people in yours are. \nIt's not right to form an opinion based on the websites and videos that's \nagainst feminism and what you've seen in your country. \nI am saying that there are a lot of feminists who do promote men's rights. \nBut these things are not as popular as women's rights among the public and \nthat's because leading feminist organizations have in some ways said that \nmen have it pretty good. \nAnd honestly, in still quite a lot of countries they do have it better than \nwomen, that's fact. But some organizations do present it is a way that says \nthat all women have the problems that developing countries do and all men \nhave it pretty good. I do agree that this is wrong.\nBack to my point though, actual feminists do try to aware people of men's \nrights, maybe you've heard of none of them, but I've heard of a lot them \neven in my own country.  \nAnd there are feminists like this in every developing country, 34 developed \ncountries, that's a lot. Saying that majority of feminists are the ones \nyou've talked about is very ignorant of you and where you've gotten your \nsources from."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDcQUoqjuGHLrFfQAbx5PbQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.13119055428009183, "authorDisplayName": "TragedyStrikes", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13pthlwnsfvxvsps04cizao5sylxteac4g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-28T21:00:50.083Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDcQUoqjuGHLrFfQAbx5PbQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.388212, "formal_score": 43, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-28T21:00:50.083Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vANVv1_-1BY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAN8/GyrB_B1Jvms/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113508291068306005626", "textDisplay": "+Fathmath Nadar\nWhen I talk about these issues, I speak about them in countries such as the \nUS and the UK and other developed countries.\nI don't want to hear the justification for feminism being women suffering \nfrom issues in other countries because most of the time they only bring \nthem up to promote feminism regardless of the fact they do very little in \ncomparison to prevent those issues as they do first world issues.  Everyone \nknows that less developed countries are shitty for women and men.  \n\nSo most of your comment is irrelevant to the point I'm speaking.  I'm \ntalking about developed countries.  I know full well there are more genuine \ngender issues in other countries.  \n\nSo I'll respond to the relevant points.\n\n*Male circumcision*\nYou claim that it's acceptable and should be condoned because it's used in \nother cultures.  Implying that religion should have the right to rule over \nthe weak and defenseless; children.\nI find this hilariously hypocritical as you are condoning such a thing with \nthe simple answer of \"it's their culture\" and telling me I have to respect \nthat culture just because it is not my own.  I do not have to respect any \nother culture.  Just because it's different does not mean I have to condone \nwhat other cultures do.  That said, all the things you bring up that women \ngo through in less developed countries can then be refuted as a non-issue \nsimply by saying that you must respect that culture because it's part of \ntheir religion and culture.  Doesn't seem fair, does it?  That's what you \njust done in regards to circumcision.\n\nAs for the \"Slut/stud\" double standard.  Women are not considered \"bad \npeople\" for it, they're considered less attractive people for it.  The \nreason for this is that, for a man, he has to earn his frequent sexual \nexperiences.  He must either be charming, rich, have status, and or power, \namong other things.  For women all they have to do is ask and they'll get \nit.  It's due to women abusing their sexual power.  The same goes with how \na man is physically stronger yet is not allowed to hit a woman, because he \nhas more physical power, even if she hits him first.\n\nYour wage gap argument makes no sense.  The wage gap is not limited to \npositions of power.  Men still make more on average than women even without \naccounting for leadership positions.  So your argument that women don't do \nso because they don't feel welcome in leadership positions has no relevance \nbecause the wage gap still exists in positions that aren't leadership roles.\nIf you're saying women can't handle leadership positions because men \ngravitated to those positions more and before women did, then you're \nessentially saying women are too emotionally and mentally immature to aim \nfor positions men gravitate to.  Regardless, you're wrong.  The fact that \nthere are women in positions of power illustrates that women can be in \npositions of power.  \n\nIf women don't want to be in positions of power because men more often are, \nthen that's their own emotional and mental issue, and that's their own \nproblem, because nobody is stopping them from being in those positions.\n\nIs it equality for men and women to have the same opportunities yet men \ntake those opportunities to do more than women?  Yes.  If women are given \nthe same opportunities, which they are, then it is their own fault for not \ntaking those opportunities.  If you're trying to tell me it would be more \n\"equal\" for a man to work more than a woman yet a woman gets paid the same \nas a man then I'll simply tell you that you have no idea what equality is.  \n\nYou then go in to telling me that a woman that is looking after her \nchildren and their house aswell as having a job has a tough life.  Well, \nthat's their problem.  It's nobody elses fault if a woman chose to have \nchildren, a job, and a home.  If the man is not there then she can sue for \nchild support to then hire a nanny.  If the father is there and does \nnothing, then she has the choice to divorce him and get child support or \ntake joint custody for the father to look after the children.  If the man \nis there and works more than the woman, then it's understandable that she \nwould have more responsibility at home, as the man is working more and \nearning more for the family.\n\nIf she wants to make a life for herself while having a family to look \nafter, then that's her choice.  However it's still her responsibility to \nlook after the children in the process, same for a man if he is only doing \nas much as the mother.  \n\n\"They shouldn't be paid less for having more to do outside their jobs.\"\n- No.  But if them having to do stuff outside of their work results in them \nnot doing as much work as the man doing more work because he doesn't have a \nfamily, then yes, that is justified.  She should not be getting paid the \nsame amount for doing less than a man doing more than her in the career.\n\nChild marriages.  Although this is an issue of less developed countries and \nI said I won't be talking about those, I will somewhat address this one.\nChild marriages happen, yes.  Sometimes to boys too, but mostly with \ngirls.  That's an issue.  However little boys are far more strapped with an \nAK (gun) and forced to fight, kill, and die.  There are issues in these \nplaces, I know that.  \n\nFeminists can complain about children forced in to marriage.  I have no \nissue with that.  My problem is that they focus on first world problems FAR \nMORE than they do child marriages and so on.  If they focused more on the \nissues you talked about, then I would be with feminists.  However, in \ngeneral, they don't.  Infact, all they do is use the suffering of women in \nthese issues to support their ideology existing in countries that don't \nsuffer from those issues, hence one of the reasons why I dislike feminism.\n\nSexual harassment.  It doesn't just start at a young age for girls.  I know \nfull well what harassment is like.  I've experienced it since I was around \nsix or seven.  However, I don't agree with your version of sexual \nharassment.  That version of it implies that the only difference between \nsexual harassment and a compliment is if the person wanted it, and how is \nthe person making a sexual advance supposed to know if the person would \nallow a sexual advance if they don't actually make a sexual advance such as \n\"Hey, would you like to have sex with me?\"  Essentially, if that was a \ngenerally accepted view of sexual harassment, barely anybody would be \nhaving intimate relations because it would require them to make a sexual \nadvance to know if the person wants to engage in sexual acts, which by the \ndefinition would be a gamble between committing a crime and getting laid.  \nFor example, I imagine you've had sex?  How did that happen?  SOmeone must \nof initiated the interest, right?  So by your version of sexual harassment, \nif you denied their advancement to you and they accepted your denial and \nwent away, they would of still sexually harassed you.  See why that's a \nproblematic way to view sexual harassment?\n\nPersonally, I've been harassed so much by women (occassionally men) \nsexually that I'm the exact same.  Simply shrug it off with a variation of \n\"haha, that's women\".  So...\nWhat country do you live in by the way?  Just curious.  \n\n\"not get any stares from us girls, of course if they're attractive, we do \nthink that, that's human nature but we don't act on it and make sexual \nremarks on their butt and penis and body shape??? what is this?\"\n- Really?  I've had my crotch grabbed, my ass slapped, sexual comments \nflung my way, and so on a whole bunch of times growing up.  If you think \nthis exclusively happens to women and that women don't do it to men, then \nyou've got another thing coming.  \n\nSo overall:\nI know women have issues in other countries, men and women have issues (for \nexample, in India a woman can legally rape a man).  Less developed \ncountries have a whole bunch of issues to work on.  The issue is that \nfeminism barely talks about those issues unless they're trying to sell \nfeminism.  They'll essentially say \"Look at all the poor women being \noppressed over there.  You should join us to stop that\" and then when you \njoin their group to stop it all you experience is feminists talking about \nfirst world problems and RARELY ever talking about real issues in other \ncountries."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMKBlP_m3KHSKDh17queA", "inappropriate_score": 0.24052916416115455, "authorDisplayName": "Fathmath Nadar", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13pthlwnsfvxvsps04cizao5sylxteac4g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-28T19:32:14.430Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeVMKBlP_m3KHSKDh17queA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.35101200000000005, "formal_score": 13, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-28T19:32:14.430Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100110704721106512901", "textDisplay": "+TragedyStrikes Ok so, I agree with a few points. \n\n\n1. Men can be drafted. I am against this. And I have no argument to make \nfor this bc I wholeheartedly agree that this is fucked up.\n\n\n\n2. Women and men are both sexually objectified when it comes to \nadvertisements, media and all that. \n\n\n3. Men cannot express their true feelings\nTrue. They're told to man up, to be strong, to not cry, etc. I don't \ndisagree, this is an issue and it should be addressed. But I find it \nextremely funny that while you people are bashing feminists, I heard about \nthis issue from feminists. Hahah, I went to a leadership camp and they had \na 2 hour session just on this issue. And to be honest, these comments are \nextremely insulting for feminists who are advocating both men and women's \nrights. I'm just going to tell you, that YES THEY DO EXIST. \nAfter this session, I even spoke to my principle about this issue, i was 16 \nat the time. And I asked the teachers to organize an assembly just to aware \nall the boys at my school to be open instead of containing all their \nfeelings. After all this, there are people like you bashing a lot feminists \nlike we're the people who are wrong what the actual fuck \n\n\n4. Male circumcision \nIn some religions, such as Islam, male circumcision is mandatory. However, \nfemale circumcision is not compulsory in ANY religion. I don't know from \nwhich country you're from, but I'm going to assume there are Muslims in \nyour country. Making laws that would override religious beliefs would be \nextremely fucking ignorant, this isn't a world that only you're living in, \nnot only your opinion and beliefs matter okay, you need to respect other \npeople's culture as well. Religions are widespread, you can't just simply \nignore it.\nThese laws being there, I'm pretty sure religion is a factor. And honestly \nthough, whether to circumcise or not to is the parent's choice. I'm not \nsure but I don't think a lot of people are forced to circumcise their \nchildren or something, at least I haven't heard about it. \nPutting religion completely to a side, female circumcision is much MUCH \nworse than male circumcision. Watch a video of both processes maybe, idk. \nor just read this:\nhttp://thecircumcisiondecision.com/male-vs-female-circumcision/\n\n\n\nAnd now for the part that makes me laugh:\n\n\n\"You say that they want to make sure women have the same rights and \nopportunities men have, yet they have more. As mentioned above about rights \nas well as opportunities such as affirmative action, educational options, \nmore opportunities for help when they are victims, and so on, which \nfeminists rarely, if ever talk about.\"\n\n\n\n*slow clap*\nBravo tho, great job. The ignorance on this one. Let me show you how much \nequal opportunities and rights women have around the world. \n\n\n1. In Saudi Arabia, women still do not have the right to vote or drive.\n\n\n2. In some parts of India, new born babies are killed just because they are \ngirls.\n\n\n3. When men have a lot of sex, they are not considered bad people \n(usually). When women have a lot of sex they are considered loose in the \nhead. \n\n\n4. Did you know that as of 2014, only 25 countries have achieved \neducational equality? This is out of a 142 countries btw. A 117 countries \nhave not achieved education equality. And by that, I mean there are girls \nwho are kept back from going to school. Here you go:\nhttp://www3.weforum.org/docs/GGGR14/GGGR_CompleteReport_2014.pdf\n\n\n\n5. In some countries 2 women are considered an equivalent to 1 man in the \ncourt of law. This just says that a woman's word in not as worthy as a \nman's. The funny thing is that these people don't even have a valid reason \nwhy a woman's word is not as worthy. They believe that women do not have \nthe \"emotional capability\" to handle these kind of situation. That women \nare fragile, that they're hearts are too soft to bare the responsibility. I \ncall bullshit. Just how men are saying they should not be stereotyped as \nstrong and being \"manly\", women should not also be stereotyped into being \nweak. Why have you not mentioned this issue? \n\n\n6. In some countries, it is illegal to have sex before marriage. But people \nstill do it, this is not the problem. The problem is that after having \nunprotected sex (often happens as people are not very educated in these \ncountries), sometimes the woman gets pregnant. Now when this happens, the \nwoman is immediately taken to the court. She is whipped 100 times for her \nsin but the man walks free. EVEN if it was rape. Is this equality to you? \nSame rights and opportunity? \nWhy does this happen? \nIn my country, video and DNA evidence cannot be valid in court, it will not \neven be considered. The rape kit is also not used, this is completely \nillogical. And there is no argument for this either other than that it has \nnever been practiced in the religion. Well OF COURSE it hasn't been \npracticed in the religion, DNA evidence was not there about a 1000 years \nago to include it in the religion. Despite the fact that it has been proved \nthat these results are VERY accurate, we have misogynistic leaders, they \nwould never approve of this. \nThe only way to prove that the man took part in the sex is if he agrees \n(which usually doesn't happen bc nobody wants to get whipped), or if 4 men \nor 8 women confirm it to the court. Now usually, people don't have sex in a \nroom with 4 guys or 8 girls watching them. Now I'm sure this is equal \nrights for women and men.\n\n\n7. The reason why abortion is a problem among feminists is because in a lot \nof countries women are more responsible than men for the baby. In some \nsituations, women have to raise the baby alone. If they don't, they are \nshamed for it. This is because quite a lot of people consider taking care \nof children a women's job in the world. I've seen this first hand. BUT, \nwhen a man abandons a baby, it's considered completely fine, at least in my \nsociety. I'm not talking about developed countries, but this happens A LOT \nin developing countries. A woman being the only person responsible, fine, \nI'll put that issue aside. \nBut now consider all the women who know that they are not capable of \nraising a child, that they cannot handle the responsibility. It's honestly \na huge commitment that some people are not ready to make. And we shouldn't \nforce them to, it could just end up with a kid that has been badly raised. \nAnd evidence proves that badly raised children are more likely to commit \ncrimes, etc. In these kind of situations, if the man thinks he is capable \nof taking care of this child till he/she grows up, then it's all well and \ngood. Just give the baby to the man, but of course the woman's gonna be \nshamed anyway in the end for abandoning her baby. society, friends. and \nobviously equality.\n\n\n\n8. Now let's talk about wage equality. :))\nYou said,\nSome of the reasons why men earn more on average are these.\na. Men gravitate towards higher paying and riskier jobs than women on \naverage.\nb. Men work longer hours on average.\nc. Men take less time off work on average.\nd. Men negotiate for higher paying salaries far more than women on average.\n \nThese are my arguments - \na&d. It's not that women are not capable. It's more about the mind set. A \nlot of women believe that they cannot handle high paying jobs, that by \nnature, they are not supposed to be in leadership positions. Now why is \nthis? Because ever since we're kids we see men. Every fucking leadership \npositions are dominated by men okay? \n- There are 9/152 women heads of state. This is 5.9%.\nThere are 15/193 heads of government. This is 7.8%. \n(The countries that have either heads of state or government as women are \nArgentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, DemarkSenegal, , Germany, \nJamaica, Liberia, Lithuania, Malawi, Norway, Republic of Korea, San Marino, \nThailand and Trinidad and Tobago)\n- There are 40/271 women speakers of parliament. This is 14.3%.\n- There are 159/601 women DEPUTY speakers of parliament. This is 26.5% and \nonly 88/188 parliaments have women deputy speakers.\n\n\nYou also said, \"Women not being 50% of CEOs is not a right.  Women earning \nthe same amount as men on average without doing as much on average is not a \n\"right\". \"\n\n\nSure, it's not a right. But, is it equality?? This whole feminism, voice \nfor a man all of this is about equality. And now you're saying it has to be \na right, to even be considered, how does that even make sense to you?\n\n\nb&c. There are working women with families, some of them need to support \nthe family on their own. They not only go for jobs, but are also considered \nresponsible for the kids. For the cleanliness of the house, to complete the \nchores. to make food. Where is she going to have time for this, if she is \ngoing to be working long hours? A lot of men are not educated to take this \nresponsibility and so they don't have to worry about it. I'm not saying \nthat all men don't take care of their own kids, I'm saying that majority \ndon't feel the need to take the responsibility as much as a woman does. And \nif a man is doing all this, do you think he would be working the same hours \nas other men and wouldn't take a lot of time off work? lovely.\n\n\nWhether a woman stays at home to take care of her kids, or doesn't is \ncompletely her choice. But it's unfair to keep the woman at home when she \nwants to go to a job and make a life of herself and vice versa. But they \nshouldn't get paid less for having more to do outside their jobs, same for \nmen. In mostly developing countries, this a huge fucking deal okay, women \nget lectured, insulted, told that she is against God just because she wants \nto for a job. My fucking mom gets shit from her family just because she \ngoes to a job, how is this equality? \nYou don't even consider the women who aren't allowed to go jobs bc they're \nhusbands have ownership over them ACCORDING TO LAW. \n\n\n9. Child marriages\nYou realize this happens without the child's approval right? You realize \nthis happens when the daughter's parents need money from the usually really \nold rich men, right? that selling off your 9 year old daughter to a 40 year \nold man to have sex with and get pregnant and give him babies is perfectly \nacceptable in some societies? Have you ever heard of a man being forced \ninto marriage especially at a young age? No, never.\nAnd if you're going to complain about how circumcision kills little boys, \nthen why can't feminists complain about children who die while giving birth \nbecause they aren't ready for it?\n\n\n10. Sexual harassment starts at a very young age for girls. And if you \ndon't know what harassment is, like a lot of people, it's any kind of \nunwelcome sexual advances or asking for sexual favors, or any other kind of \nverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. \nI started getting harassed at the age of 9, just by walking on the streets \nof my country. They'd throw nasty remarks my way, I wasn't allowed to wear \nanything above my knees at the age of 9 cause I was told that it would \nprovoke men. But even after I started wearing long jeans, shirts with long \nsleeves, I still get harassed. And women in my country are so used to it, \nthat they consider this a normal event, just shrug it off their shoulder, \nhaha that's men. We should be careful and men should be able to do whatever \nthey want, that is the belief in my society. But honestly if we can keep it \nour pants, then these men should be able to as well. They can run around \nhalf naked and not get any stares from us girls, of course if they're \nattractive, we do think that, that's human nature but we don't act on it \nand make sexual remarks on their butt and penis and body shape??? what is \nthis?\nThere are women who believe they are of so much less worth than men that \nthey don't consider rape a big deal, they wouldn't even report it. I know \npeople like this, they think they are sexual servants of men, why are \nparents raising they're kids to believe this, i dont know.\nAnd I know that men can also be sexually harassed, I know that. But not as \nmuch as women, and not starting at such an early age. \n\n\nI have many more reasons, but this is already way too long. You people are \nbeing completely blind sided when it comes to women in other countries. \nHowever, you are bringing men's issues in other countries. That's pretty \nfucking unfair as well, you can't just talk about all the rights that women \nhave in your country, you should countries like this as well. And to me it \nseems like you have not done enough research. And I'm sorry if I'm being \nrude, but you're being pretty fucking rude to the third type of feminists. \n\n\nThe few feminists who actually do advocate men's and women's rights in \ntheir country. \n\n\nStop talking about being open minded and having wide opinions or smth like \nidk, stop it. bc if you're not gonna be aware of these situations how is \nthat being open minded? It's still there, these problems still exist. Go to \nIndia, Maldives, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Yemen, women in these countries \nare far from equality and this is why we still need feminism. \n\n\nAlso, I wasn't being mindful about my spellings or language, I was just \npretty fucking mad and I'm not going to try correcting myself because this \nis probably not going to make a difference on your opinion anyway. But it's \nworth a try."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxuk40oUqsP1toYJjUAozFA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Pierre Blaise", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13pthlwnsfvxvsps04cizao5sylxteac4g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-26T07:17:01.437Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxuk40oUqsP1toYJjUAozFA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.11875799999999997, "formal_score": 36, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-26T07:17:01.437Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nggvrfrkZ14/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/CDpPt5Ll5ZA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113904418620497024248", "textDisplay": "20 years of feminism in a nutshell"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5J28xrArmR-ZDhefv20Ikw", "inappropriate_score": 1.4778325123152709, "authorDisplayName": "Ash Telikos", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13pthlwnsfvxvsps04cizao5sylxteac4g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-16T21:16:53.009Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5J28xrArmR-ZDhefv20Ikw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.11060000000000003, "formal_score": 29, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-16T21:20:41.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FO3Truu9nU0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANY/SxYJyzqaqjo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103560015008474034085", "textDisplay": "+nicole miarey\u200b Really?

A group of \"people\" can alter their group past their definition \ndespite the initial intention fitting the definition.  Feminism is about \ntheir assumption on what equality is but their assumption has proven to \nproduce sexism, not equality.  \nWe judge people based on what those people do and say, not what a piece of \ntext say.  So if you insist on me looking at feminists producing sexist \nclaims after sexist claims then look at the definition and just say \"Well I \nguess those feminists didn't just say something sexist\" then you have \nanother thing coming.  \n\nYou might want to be easily led by a piece of text of a group of people but \nI'm not willing to be.\n\nOn that note.  What do you think of the MRM?\n\n*Prison sentencing*\nYes, in populations made up of a certain race, that race is likely to have \ncertain benefits.  This is not exclusive to societies primarily made of \nwhite people.\n\n*Circumcision*\nYes, ofcourse you do.  You also don't support female genital mutilation \n(which yes I was aware of exists), all while refering to female genital \nmutilation as \"The EXACT same thing\" as male circumcision.  Yet one is \nlegal and the other is not.  Sexism.\nYou're wrong, not just on the point but you really are morally wrong if you \nthink it's acceptable for parents to alter an infant male's genitals due to \ntheir own retarded reasons.  The fact that you advocate for parents to be \nable to do that to infant males but not infant females makes it sexist.  \nYou're wrong and you're sexist.\nTo claim that circumcision does not reduce quality of life shows that you \nlack knowledge on the subject, yet you'd still have the ability to have it \navailable happen.  Jesus.  Anyway.  An estimate of 100 children a year die \nof the circumcision proceedure.  *Does not reduce quality of life*.  It's \nalso sexual assault by definition.  You're advocating for sexual assault on \ninfant males.  *Does not reduce quality of life*.  \nYour justification for it is that it's more hygienic.  Do me a favour, \ndearie.  Stand up.  Go on, I'm not joking.  Stand up.  Go to your \nbathroom.  Come back.  Now go to your window.  Open the window.  Take a \ngood look outside.  By now you'd of realized that we don't live in the damn \ndays Jesus was moonwalking on water.  We live in the damn modern day where \nwe can be \"more hygienic\" while keeping our foreskins because it's \nextremely easy to clean the male genitals now.  -_-\n\n*Women have more rights/Men have less rights*\nOk, let me give you three.\n1. Men have no right to genital integrity (circumcision).\n2. Men have less reproductive rights (Abortion) despite there being methods \nin which they can have the same rights with different methods that do not \nconflict with the female's right to choose (financial abortion).\n3. My personal favorite.  Men can be drafted.  Men can be foreced to fight, \nkill, and die against their will, women cannot.  If men refuse to do this \nthen they can face up to five years in prison, a charge of $250,000, cannot \ntake government loans, cannot enter certain fields of work, nor can they \ndrive.  So as a matter of fact, you get the BASIC human rights while men \nmust have to take on societal obligations to earn those same rights.  You \nhave to be a civilian to have freedom, men must be soldiers on call.  Fair, \nright?\n\nNo, women are not generally paid less.  The information is out there that I \ncan't believe I have to do this yet again.  \nSome of the reasons why men *earn* more on average are these.\n- Men gravitate towards higher paying and riskier jobs than women on \naverage.\n- Men work longer hours on average.\n- Men take less time off work on average.\n- Men negotiate for higher paying salaries far more than women on average.\n\nHence why men are more likely to earn more and advance more.  It's not \ninequality for one group on average to have more initiative to earn and \nprogress more and you're out of your mind if you feel entitled to what they \nearn and achieve purely due to the fact men take the initiative and do more \nthan you're willing to do as women on average.\n\nYou tell me not to say women do not want it as much or that women are \nlazier.  Well, in other words that's exactly true and you can't tell me not \nto give you the answer to the question just because you dislike it.  Women \ngenerally are less likely to gravitate to the harder and riskier jobs than \nmen are to achieve larger sums of money.  So if you want more money, do as \nmuch as men to the same extent on average.  You don't get to sit in a nice \noffice building, tapping away at the computer, all while people are down in \nthe mines doing hard and physical labour and then complain you don't get as \nmuch as those that work harder than you.\n\nYes, I am sure there are man females wanting to be CEOs.  Wanting does not \nequate to doing what is necessary to become a CEO though.  Women have shown \nthat they can become CEOs already.  If there is a disparity in male and \nfemale CEOs then either men are doing what is needed more to become CEOs \nthan women or men want to be CEOs more than women do, therefor do the work.\n\nYour list was not a list of rights.  You should be made aware of that.  I \nwas fair and gave you a response on those issues but those are not legal \nrights.  Women not being 50% of CEOs is not a right.  Women earning the \nsame amount as men on average without doing as much on average is not a \n\"right\".  \n\n*Feminazis*\nShow me.  A link would be nice.  Specifically one with time stamps so I can \nsee when they were done.  Your three most recent would do.\nYou say you don't understand how someone can say one method of rape is \nworse than another, yet you yourself made a very similar comparison when it \ncame to male and female circumcision.\nNot saying you're a feminazi but that is a tad hypocritical.\n\nI'm all fine if we all banded together.  It's feminists that initiated this \nwar on men and have prevented men's issues being talked about numerous \ntimes, sometimes breaking laws to do so.  If feminis, dropped the \nmisinformation they have and wasn't as immature as it showed itself to be \nthen I'd be fine with it.  I used to be a feminist.  Until then it won't \nhappen and I don't believe that time will come."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC518ETWgR47Q9MgGIAj6TKA", "inappropriate_score": 0.26507620941020543, "authorDisplayName": "Bo Dunmire", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13pthlwnsfvxvsps04cizao5sylxteac4g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-16T04:58:51.142Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC518ETWgR47Q9MgGIAj6TKA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.41660399999999997, "formal_score": 6, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-16T04:58:51.142Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106783606853149881281", "textDisplay": "+TragedyStrikes\nI skimmed through yuour post and I have a couple points to make: First \nthat, by definition, feminism IS about equality. \nhttps://www.google.com/#q=define+feminism\n\nSecond, you said women are better off then men in lots of regards. I do \nagree that there is a problem with how men are sentenced worse than women. \nThat is DEFINITELY true and DEFINITELY fucked up. I have seen first hand \nhow messed up the American legal system is, and I couldn't agree more. \nMen(weirdly), minorities, and even less attractive people(I shit you not) \nare more likely to get harsher and longer sentences. There are a ton of \nbias sentences and I don't agree with any of them. I think we need to do \nbetter, yes. But it's for more than men... it's a matter of getting rid of \nany type of bias. Not that men's issues are any /less/ of a problem, but \nyou cannot deny that there is less prevalent bias across the board for \nWHITE men vs other races.\n\nAs for circumcision, I do believe parents have that choice. It sucks for \nanyone who may want to keep it. However, male circumcision does not reduce \nquality of life, and is more hygienic. So I am confused as to why that \nwould be a serious issue of harm...? It's a matter of choice issue, really. \n& in that way, I do think they should have the choice. But at the same \ntime, like I said, the damage induced is minimal and it's done in a safe \nway while young. On the contrary, women ARE subjected to the EXACT same \nthing - circumcision. & it is worse for women. Their vagina sewed up, their \nclitoris/labia in general cut off - these things actually do happen as \nwell. It's practiced in various parts of the world(although not popularly \nanymore, I believe? I only know it still happens weirdly often in some \nplaces, not exact numbers or anything - I need to look into it more some \ntime, eh), and unlike mens circumcision, it's painful(generally done later \nin life) and... well, seriously messed up in every way. You should check it \nout some time as well.\n\nI also noticed you said uhh... what was it...\nOh right. That women have more rights than men.\nThis was just... okay I'm sorry but I have got to hear your reasoning for \nthis. How do women have more rights in this world, exactly? You need to \ntell me, because that just blows my mind that anyone would think that. \nHere's a point: women get generally less pay and less advancement than men \nin the workplace. Explain this, and please don't pull some \"well women \ndon't want it as much\" or \"women are lazier\" stuff coz we both know it's up \nto the individual, not the generalities in a group. There are surely plenty \nof psychopath women just waiting to be the CEO of a company just like the \npsychopath men, lol. :P But yeah, please elaborate, and specific points or \nreferences would be awesome. A list would be even awesome-er, just for \nreference! But present it how you want. Just would be easier that way. I \ncan do the same if you want - just let me know.\n\nAs for not targeting feminazis, I definitely do. I think the disparity with \nrape and similar issues are insane. I don't understand how anyone can say a \nman being raped somehow means less than a woman being raped. I understand \nthe frustration people must feel when they are faced with this and if they \nsay anything about it, they are shrugged off as \"typical angry men\" and the \nlike. You'd think women would get this especially, since they have to deal \nwith being shrugged off when they're mad as well - \"oh, clearly someone's \non the rag\". Yet they don't even see the similarities.\n\nUltimately, my point is that I think we're all the same and we need to \nfucking just GET THIS instead of being like \"I'm more held back\" \"no I am\" \nblahblah. People should move forward as one. I don't know why we can't just \nagree that EVERY person and EVERY race has places where they are put down \njust because of how they were born. This is a fact. You can and will be \njudged, regardless of your gender, skin color, religion, sexuality, etc.."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSWpxMSbQT5tZJHSg1WuFcA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Itsmeeman1", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13pthlwnsfvxvsps04cizao5sylxteac4g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-15T21:03:36.227Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCSWpxMSbQT5tZJHSg1WuFcA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.51218999999999992, "formal_score": 11, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-15T21:03:36.227Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112665435340192039033", "textDisplay": "+Bunny Mask   These isn't a level for your kind of naivety and ignorance."}}]}, "z12rwz5j4ynmtj0w404ce31xckr4zhs5vig": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK0qd4RRtWiEzYxHhMxToDg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Erik Page", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-21T02:24:10.725Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCK0qd4RRtWiEzYxHhMxToDg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.71612600000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-21T02:24:10.725Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105955094399106779631", "textDisplay": "Quickest way to make sure you won't get raped is to chop your hair off like \nthis uggo\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12csfnpfsqzwp44v04cfdbb1qjvctqbpeo": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM_Y1jlD7TmjvdplTUbfgew", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mHPKx53f95w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/rbFvhgZT9Gs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "LEO Messi", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-11T05:48:36.999Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCM_Y1jlD7TmjvdplTUbfgew"}, "sentiment_score": -0.73774800000000007, "formal_score": 12, "updatedAt": "2015-06-11T05:48:36.999Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108331473716393272716", "textDisplay": "I'm confused ! which way is best FEMINAZIS or ISIS ? lol\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12oc52paz2afvoko220zvjrly20sll4h04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdmyquXjNQ_30hqg7H4RZzw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-giWZZbJDTb4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAF8/J9lmCD4S6C8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "LucklessObserver", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T08:03:47.938Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdmyquXjNQ_30hqg7H4RZzw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.44390400000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T08:03:47.938Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102849032927926388580", "textDisplay": "she's like the anti ellen degeneres....\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13kgdtofym5jfdcs23swjtwhwehd1wvj": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY5b_m66TtOHapRp9J2U1Tg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-520SaUSuE6Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHk/89Aosqp-Tl0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.1173184357541899, "authorDisplayName": "David Cage's Script", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-15T19:04:34.496Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCY5b_m66TtOHapRp9J2U1Tg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9089199, "formal_score": 11, "updatedAt": "2015-07-15T19:04:34.496Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113410986391920479957", "textDisplay": "\"Comparing a stupid, drunk, helmet-chasing whore who gets fingered while \npassed out to an actual rape victim is completely and utterly absurd.\"\n\nI don't QUITE understand this logic.

Judge as some men don't \nwant to be 'protectors ' and shouldn't be forded to be something that they \ndon't want to be because evolution dictates it. Evolution also dictated me \nto shit on a dirt hole and run from predators, I sure don't want to do that.\n\n-------\n\nWomen DIDN'T wait until modern age to demand equality. This is as \nintellectually dishonest as it is historically illiterate. Lucky for you, i \ndedicate my life to history.\n\nThere has been hundreds of societies in which women were equality to men \n(ancient egypt, ancient China, Mesopotamia, Visigoths, sparta, Babylonian, \nsome parts of europe )\nWomen have fought in wars, been in governments, owned land, had slaves, \nbeen slaves, and had just as shitty life as men. The fact that some of then \nstayed behind was because a few had to stay behind and mother the future \ngenerations of 'the clan '. \n\nLet me fast forward a few thousand years after the fall of great Greece and \nlet's go to Rome when it was rising to power: Rome was a very patriotic \nsociety, women were not allowed in laws nor in politics, Instead Rome \npotrayed them and treasures of the country and the Creator of Rome's sons. \nThis was a large scale empire with very strict gender rolles and social \nstructures in which everyone had to obey. Slaves (both men and women) \nworked in appalling conditions in mines, domestic work, and both were sold \nlike sec slaves.\n\nThen came Christianity, they keep Rome's patriotic social contract with \nthem but this time added a God and sexual opression. Even so many great \nwoman fought in European wars like Johna of Arch and Queen Elisabeth the \nfirst. \n\nBut any poor mind and woman who dared question the religious society of \ntheir time were quickly executed for harasy. the point as to why women \ndidn't revolt in the middle ages is because they COULDN'T, the society \nwould've fallen on them, so would the church, and any woman who didn't have \nthe money and power to do as she wants even attempted to be different, she \nwould have been kicked out of here family and forded to live out like a \nwhore or die alone. In an evolutionary stand point what is better: comply \nand silently move ideas (like in books and reunions ), or be a lone rebel \nand starve to death? \n\nI'm sure you know the rest of history. after the French revolution and \ntheir ideals that all HUMANS (not just men ) were made equal, feminism was \ngaining streanch and being born in the newly freed nations from the church \nand their opressed lives.\n\nKnow your history *smacks you with book *\n\n-----------\n\nNo, women did not 'latch on to men's that is your ignorance talking.\nIt is clear you have not opened one book sense high-school.

The agenda is quite simple.\n1. Work actively to preserve the benefits of being considered unequal to \nmen. (Chivalry, alimony laws, mandatory child support, affirmative action \nprograms, disproportionate funding for female victims of domestic violence \nand sexual assault, etc)\n2. Work actively to pursue \"equality\" when beneficial to women.  (Mandatory \nequal pay, equal educational and athletic opportunities in college, etc.)\n3. Assume almost non of the responsibility which should accompany \nequality.  (Give us birth control, the morning-after pill, IUD's and \nabortion, but still let us hold men & the state responsible for our actions \nwith mandatory child support.  Let us vote, but do not force us to sign up \nfor selective service.  Give us mandatory equally pay and affirmative \naction programs, but let us leech off of men in the form of chivalric \nsocial customs and alimony, in the event of divorce)\n4.  Perpetuate the idea that women are victims and have no sense of \nagency.  Do this through any means possible, including specious statistics \nand selective \"analysis\". (The 1/5 rape myth is based on an online survey \nof 2 public universities and had a response rate of less than 35 percent.  \nIn addition the survey methods were flawed and dishonestly included many \nindividuals who claimed that their drunk/high encounters were consensual)  \nThe only credible statistic, which is released by the BJS, has the number \nat 6.1/1000)\n5.  Claim that you are for equality but actively OPPOSE and DEFAME \ngroups which work to help male victims of sexual assault, suicide and \ndomestic violence, referring to them as hateful, bigoted and misogynistic. \n6.  Jump to promote and circumvent due-process in an incident that may help \nfurther the feminists narrative, no matter how little evidence exists (UVA, \nWinston, Duke etc).  Meanwhile, ignore many real and objectively more \nsevere incidents of sexual violence and misogyny when they do not further \nthe narrative of the suburban white male oppressor.

When you make a rape joke, everyone would \npicture in their head of a girl being rape by a man. Over 93% of all rape \nvictims are females (NCADV). That make sense because women are averagely \n50% weaker than men. Which links to your Ray Rice Claim. Also, there's a \nlaw about the whole defending yourself thing, I won't go into detail but \nbasically the guy broke it. \n\n\nI believe that feminism is for everyone.

You have the same chance of \nbeing high in cholesterol (if not more) being within normal weight as \n\"overweight\" people. And emotional health is as important as physical \nhealth (Believe me, I Aced almost all of my AP psychology tests). \nFat-shaming is unacceptable, especially when people get fat shamed at the \ngym trying to lose weight. \n\n\nFalse rape accusation statistics is a dark number to me, so many different \nsources say different things, until we can develop a perfect lie detector, \nthis statistics is quite weak.\n\n\nYou know, it pisses me off too when some feminists only think about women \nand think all men are rapists. But there are good and bad people in every \nstance, movement or religion. I don't know why we have to fight on who is \ndeeper into the pile of shit. The truth is both sexes are, we should really \naccept and help each other get out of this crap together. \n\n\nI learned to respect women because they raised me.

This very evening I read an \narticle from COSMO titled. \u201c18 Reasons Not to Give Him a Blowjob.\u201d It was a \ndevastatingly stupid piece, even for COSMO, offering such sage advice (to \nwomen who apparently need it) about why it is a bad idea, among other \nthings, to have someone else\u2019s venereal warts in your mouth.\n\nWhat the piece did not deliver on substance, it did at least provide an \nopportunity for some levity. Here is essentially the same piece, with sexes \nand circumstances switched around just enough to make it pretty serious.\n\nIt\u2019s light reading, but I promise you it is better than what you would have \nread in COSMO \u2013 which I grit my teeth and suggest you read first.\n\nSo, why should you not give your girl a single dime?\"\nAlthough in reality it's not bad advice, basically every women I've ever \nbeen sexually involved with at one point or another expected me to give \nthem money, buy/share alcohol and drugs with them. Some people are well \naware and accept that this is the dynamic of their so called relationship. \nBut in those situations your so called partner isn't much more than an \nexpensive prostituite that you otherwise pay to hang out with you. That \nbeing said I don't think it's a gendered issue. Especially when it comes to \nolder women and gay men the same dynamic can often play out with a simple \nreversal of gender. The point behind the satire is that unless you want a \nrelationship based on money. Then you should try not to give your partner \nthe impression that they can manipulate you for money through sex or \nthreats of infidelity. When that fails to work and they feel they really \n\"need\" the money to get intoxicated. They will say if they can't find \nsomeone to lend them the money they will just prostituite themselves. The \nissue is that if you refuse to give them money they'll simply move onto \nsomeone else. Which is still what you should do but it becomes an issue for \npeople who easily develop emotional attachments. I'd also like to make it \nclear I'm not talking about picking up the tab.

geez, i wonder why.)\n\ni would talk about femicide but clearly you're not willing to discuss \nthings that could potentially hurt your arguments and thus only wanted to \ntalk about \"the western world\", so. just saying, it's something you should \nlook up. \n\nyou're probably gonna say this isn't a \"proper right\", but, seriously, you \ncan walk home alone at night without fearing for your life. you will never \nunderstand what it feels like to be scared of something as simple as a bus \nride home from the cinema. you won't know what it feels like to be sexually \nharassed and then have it all blamed on you because wore a short skirt. \n(and before you twist my words and claim i said something i didn't say: \nyes, i am aware that men can be victims of sexual violence as well and that \nis just as awful.)\n\ni guess talking about abortion rights is gonna go way over your head, so \nlet's not even go there. let's just say that a countless number of women \neach year are forced to give birth. imagine what it's like to, say, be \nraped, get pregnant, and then told you don't have the right to an abortion. \nthis isn't even something men have to deal with! ever! and yet it's mostly \nmen who organize \"abortion is murder\" protests. \n\nmen have the right to NOT be subjected to gross sexism in high profile \njobs. let's face it, most of the leaders of the world are men. which isn't \nexactly equal, is it. but, should there be a high profile woman in politics \n-- let's take hilary clinton as an example -- is she judged based on her \nskills? no, she's judged based on her appearance. oh she wore an ugly \ndress, oh she had no make.up on, oh dear. this has literally been all over \nthe media. also, to quote an article that made an excellent point: \"When \nthe media asks what type of leader a man will be, in the same role, they \nwill ask if a woman can lead.\" \n\nyou have the right to drink and party without being judged for it. when a \nwoman gets drunk, they're immediately labeled gross and slutty. and, if a \nwoman is drunk and gets raped, the blame is usually blamed on the victim. \nthey shouldn't have drunk so much, they shouldn't have dressed like that, \netc. remember the steubenville case? a high school girl was sexually \nassaulted and yet the media seemed more worried about how \"this incident \ncould ruin the future of these two young boys\". \n\nso yeah. is this enough, zachary? i hope it opens your eyes a little bit. i \nhope you realize we are very fucking far from gender equality."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDlywiThHHEJDAl_5HHAHYA", "inappropriate_score": 0.92165898617511521, "authorDisplayName": "teapotlizard", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125elvhipbkw1zlu22evplaqrurdbjr504", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-22T18:52:59.929Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDlywiThHHEJDAl_5HHAHYA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.49491599999999997, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-22T18:52:59.929Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NI2_cabhCnM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/_h7p96WkGgY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112265089718502618556", "textDisplay": "+Hem3fiction i'm referring to you telling mina that i was only talking to \nher because i felt sorry for her. which counts as acting like you know me \nand my reasons for complimenting someone, which you very much don't, so \nplease kindly shut up.\n\nwhy can't you just admit your mistake and apologize and move on?

Not surprising considering \nthe ENTIRE feminist movement is based off of the same system of propaganda \nboth the KKK and Nazis used. Both the KKK and the Nazis once used American \nmedia to push their propaganda and at one time American also thought the \nKKK and Nazis were just awesome! The we had civil rights and World War 2 to \nwake people the hell up. Feminism is copying the EXACT same method of \npropaganda right down to enlisting Hollywood to pimp their message. Like \nthe Nazis and KKK feminists act like they are all about helping everyone \nwhen in fact as we know acknowledge they were evil hate groups dedicated \nonly to themselves.\n\nHeck feminists don't even hide it that well. Look at their main \nspokeswomen: Rich, entitled white women like Emma Watson and Patricia \nArquette and sure enough, Patricia in her Oscar speech demanded that \nMINORITIES owed white women! And their are still people who claim feminism \nis about equality for all. \n\n\nDo \u201cFeminists\u201d really want equality? On an individual and group basis the \nanswer is usually a quick yes. But do the views of what equality means stay \nthe same for individual feminists and feminist groups, that answer would be \na resounding no.\n\nWhere feminist demands break down:\n\n1.) Equal Pay\nThe fact is women make the same amount for the same work as men. \nBoth a male and female pediatrician with the same experience, same \neducation, and same level of performance, who are both working the same \nhours, for the same employer are both going to make the same salary. The \npay difference occurs when one of the two varies. Generally regardless of \nsex if you have more experience, better performance, or work longer hours, \nyou will make more money.\n \nFeminism ignores this though and treats any case of a women making less \nimmediately as discrimination, never looking at any factors that cause the \ndifference. Worse is the feminist demand for equal pay for \u201cequivalent\u201d \neducation. What that means is if a man has a four year degree in \nengineering and goes to work for an engineering firm making 60,000.00 a \nyear, then a women with a four year degree in sociology should also make \n60,00.00 a year working for the same company, despite the difference in \ndegrees or their relevant positions in the company. This is of course a \nridiculous request to make, but feminists refuse to use logic.\n\nFeminism also treats a woman\u2019s choice to not work or to work less as a \nresult of societal pressure and not an actual choice. This is offensive to \nall women for it suggests women are incapable of making rational choices \nwithout feminist guidance.\n\n2.) More Than Equal\nFeminism is confusing in its constant promotion of \u201cFemale Power\u201d or \u201cGirl \nPower.\u201d On the one hand you have ads, music, music videos, books, movies, \ntelevision shows, and other sources of media constantly spreading the \nmessage of \u201cGirl power\u201d and how any woman is the equal to any man, how \nwomen can do anything a man can do and more! Women can do anything and can \ngive birth making women superior to men. Women are smarter, women are \nhealthier, women live longer, there are more women than men alive today, \nthere are more women in college than men and much, much more!\n\nOn the other hand, feminism is constantly decrying how women are \nsubjugated, humiliated, controlled, put down, beaten, raped, murdered, \nuneducated, and have just about every disadvantaged you could think of to \novercome. How can women be both the ultimate victims and the ultimate sex \nat the same time? The simple answer is they can not and of course they are \nneither the ultimate victims or the ultimate sex either. Women and men have \na necessary symbiotic relationship. We need each other to not only survive \nbut to thrive as a species. The \u201cwho is better\u201d debate reeks of immaturity \nbecause it is immature and shows a monumental lack of thinking.\n\n3.) The Small/Big Stuff\nReal 100% equality for both sexes would benefit men way more than women, \nhowever feminism is not about real equality it is about making women \nsuperior to men.\nWomen would have to start dying years earlier, women would have to start \nfilling half the ranks of soldiers in every war, women would have to give \nup the massive amount of extra spending on female illnesses and diseases \nthat male illnesses do not receive, women would have to start filling the \nranks of the most dangerous and dirtiest jobs which men account for 98% \n(jobs women rarely ever apply for), and many more.\n\nWomen would have to give up all preferential treatment they currently \nreceive, treatment most women seem to feel entitled to and rarely think \nabout, such as:\nHolding doors open, pulling seats out, first off the sinking ship, first \nresponse medical care, half or more of everything during divorce \nsettlements, full custody of children, child support, alimony, billions in \nfederal and state money strictly set a side for woman\u2019s issues, WIC, Free \nprenatal care, free health care, first choice status in numerous business \nand government jobs, no requirement to die in wars, dozens of extra rights, \nthe list goes on and on.\n\n4.) The Obvious\nFeminism in its very name promotes the feminine over the masculine. If the \ngroup were actually about continued equality between men and women it would \nbe called equalism. No feminist would join a group called masculanism no \nmatter how beneficial the group might be, so why the act of surprise or \nindignation when men don't jump on board the feminine first train? \n\n5.) The Offensive\nGo on the offense and don't stop! The primary tactic of most volatile \ngroups including a lot of feminist groups. The tactic is simple: Yell, \nScream, Accuse, and repeat. The reason for this basic tactic is to get knee \njerk reactions from people so there is no time for people to think about \nthe demands or message the group is spreading.\n\nCommon statements screamed by feminists and the logical response they do \nnot want you to hear or think about include:\n\n \u201cYou don't know what its like to be a woman\u201d \u2013 \u201cYou do not know what it is \nlike to be a man\u201d\n(A very common tactic broken immediately on rebuttal)\n\n\u201cWomen give life, Men can't give birth\u201d - \u201cMen give life, women need men to \nbecome pregnant\u201d\n(Oddly feminists forget this very important fact, as well as the fact men \ntraditionally have cared for and supported the woman during and after \npregnancy)\n\n\u201cMen start all the wars\u201d - \u201cWomen start all the wars\u201d \n(Blanket terms do not fact make, History is rife with both genders acting \nstupid)\n\n\u201cMen oppress women\u201d - \u201cWomen oppress men\u201d\n(Another blanket statement not grounded in reality, This is America, Gender \nequality is a fact here)\n\n\u201cMen are more violent than women\u201d - \u201cNot according to over 223 empirical \nstudies\u201d\n(Fact women are as aggressive as men and they are more likely to initiate \nviolence)\n\n\u201cThere are more men in prison than women\u201d - \u201cThank you for pointing out a \nmassive inequity men suffer\u201d\n(Women consistently get much lighter sentences than men for the exact same \ncrimes) \n\n\"Men are more abusive and rape more\" - \"Feminist lie, that has extensively \nbeen proven wrong\"\n(Fact women commit 70% of all child abuse and child rape. Women also commit \n50% of all adult rape and abuse)\n \n\n6.) You Should Argue\nThe fact is modern feminism in America is more about getting free stuff and \nmaking feminist organizations money (yes non profits get to pay the people \nwho run them and pay them a lot). A real argument that rarely gets \naddressed and really should be at the top of any list is; \n1. Why are our history books missing all the advancement and contributions \nof women? Woman\u2019s history should not be kept to a college class room it \nshould be incorporated into the history we learn from kindergarten.\n2. Women and men are obviously physically different, that does not mean \nhowever that one is better than the other. As you grow up ignore all \ncraziness about who is better.\n3. Equality in choice is what matters, both sexes have the right to choose \nany life they want. You are not oppressed if you choose a life taking care \nof a spouse/life mate and kids. Nor does your choice instantly make you \nbetter or worse than some one else. Taking care of the kids does not make \nyou better than the one making the money. Making the money does not make \nyou better than the one taking care of the kids.\n4. We all need each other.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12swlfq2vv1il1dk23qdlgicvmifhb2a": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 20, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQI7Eejav2iBpSLS-e5kEbw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MIoGV-q_4ao/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJA/XwcrUUA5Um8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Peter Peterson", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-12T22:12:29.395Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQI7Eejav2iBpSLS-e5kEbw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.82466430000000002, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2015-02-12T22:12:29.395Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108131363967116990200", "textDisplay": "Haha, you people actually think there is such thing as \"gender\", lol gender \nis a social construct YA chumps!

Just \nshows how pampered some women are in today's society. Yes, I'm pretty sure \nyou're a woman, as you say you're a feminist because \"women have it worse\".\n\nFirstly, the \"women get paid less\" -reasoning has been overblown, women \ngenerally get equal wages. But people who use these statistics (*cough* \nfeminists *cough*) only look at averages, not what kind of jobs women do or \nfor how many hours a week, or how many vacations they take. When you adjust \nfor these facts, women get paid about the same PER HOUR as men do. Women \njust work less.\n\nWomen are expected to save themselves for their husband? What? I don't know \nwhere you live, maybe it's some kind of thing there, but in most civilized \ncountries that kind of reasoning hasn't been valid for half a century. \nMaybe even longer. And even then, it's a ridicilous reason to be a \nfeminist. If it was a law, then it might be a reason to be angry. But when \nit's just some vague belief of some vague group of people, \"them\", who may \nnot even exist... It's pretty ridicilous to become an activist over \nsomething like that. Unless, of course, you've lead a pampered life and \nnever actually had to face any real difficulties.\n\nFeminists are not fighting for equality. The name 'feminist' is derived \nfrom 'female'. Something that started as women's right movement and has a \nname with a meaning that only applies to a certain group can NOT fight for \nequality. Feminism was valid at one point in time, but it has accomplished \nmost of its goals in civilized countries. They may have a place somewhere \nelse in the world.. but then again, you don't see the feminists doing much \nthere, do you? All you see is whine about \"patriarchy\" in US and Europe: \nplaces where these feminists know they can whine and stomp all they want \nwithout ever facing any real danger or opposition. Ironic, that they are \nonly able to whine so much because they are already so priviledged that no \none dares say a word against them in fear of a crusade. Getting doxxed, \nhaving your private information spread over the internet and worse, all for \nspeaking against some nutty feminist on internet is insane.\n\nYes, there are some problems on \"both sides\" (funny how only a feminist \nsees two sides where others would like to see only one group: humans), but \nnot enough to merit an activist group for women. Not anymore. Feminists \nhave done enough, and it's time for them to go. Men, on other hand, could \nactually use a group. I don't know a single country in the world that \nforcibly conscripts only women in their army, but I know plenty that do it \nfor men. I've seen some ridicilous feminist throw around the argument that \nwar is bad and women are hit by it worst \"because they have to bear the \nburden of losing their sons and husbands\". Seriously? No one sees the \nelephant in the room here? Pretty much all armies consist of men, and they \nare the ones losing their lives. And that's just one of the most obvious \ninequalities. I haven't seen a single feminist ask for equal conscription, \never. Sure, a few may have spoken against conscription and wars in general, \nbut not a single one has asked for conscription for women. \n\nAnd to me, conscription and at worst, getting killed \"in service of your \ncountry\" is a fuckload worse than some vague expectation that \"women need \nto save themselves\" or - if it was even true - getting paid some 20% less. \nYou are a wimp, and it has nothing to do with your gender."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsSnDYmlJV6uK4qolUVhm_A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "KidsWithGuns1992", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13uf1w4rpaxzrqk522ufxohiyuvw1ckl", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-10T08:42:51.473Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCsSnDYmlJV6uK4qolUVhm_A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.25017399999999995, "formal_score": 13, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-10T08:42:51.473Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100590166568778692688", "textDisplay": "+mia haugan I agree, the person you replied to doesn't even realize their \nown inherent sexism against men as well as women.

As men  make up more of the population by millions, \ninstantly are known to have more testosterone generally (not in every case \nbut most) have a higher \"stat of being aggro\" in the first place. \n\n-- \n\nHell let's not even bring in parental instincts where women will get overly \ndefensive of their child (this happens in nature with wild animals as it \ndoes with humans as well)  People call this motherly instinct, which in a \ncase would imply violence is a part of a woman's construct just as it is of \nman.  [Adrenaline in these instances is normally known to be higher, notice \nhow I made mention of a factor that isn't testosterone, go figure]"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf6F8p7kzAcIKXVSEE0xVsw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jonathan Zargosky (J.Z.)", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12jixppfyu0ejagf04ccnkpdsr1gfwxnh0", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-30T15:14:06.109Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCf6F8p7kzAcIKXVSEE0xVsw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.73589199999999999, "formal_score": 29, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-30T15:14:55.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kg7YvqQDj-k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAUU/vi06gowvIss/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116678928685922125862", "textDisplay": "+blackburn9 \n\n*HAHAHA.

When female proxy violence is taken \ninto account, (women manipulating and prompting/provoking men to be violent \ntowards other men, it shows that women are just as, if not more oriented \ntowards violence than men. Also much of the violence directed at men by \nwomen isn't classified as violent and seldom enter any statistical record. \nFemale proxy violence isn't considered on the statistical record, and much \nof the data about prisons, isn't about men as much as undocumented and \nuntreated mental illness, and an abusive authoritarian system that over \nprosecutes for the sake of meeting quotas expected from private prison \ncorporations. Roughly 1/3 of the men placed in prison aren't violent nor \nhave been convicted of violent offenses, yet enter an environment where \nviolence is necessary to survive. Women's prisons have the same violent \ninmates yet the criteria for aggression and violent acts is different for \nwomen in which the petty acts of aggression by women isn't factored as \nviolent as it would if a man expressed the same acts. Women are less likely \nface equal sentencing for the same crime and that impacts the stats too \nsince what is considered aggression and violence in women is typically \nminimized or rationalized.\n\nWhen men are within environments that are open and less constrained by \noverbearing governments, and theocratic institutions and manipulative \nideological demands to exist as self sacrificing towards women and are \nafforded reasonable fair opportunities to develop without women as an \nabsolute priority for sense of self and self esteem is manifested on the \nbasis of personal merit education and not on the basis of arbitrary, \ncontradictory standards created by feminist misandrist the underpinnings of \nemotional aggression towards women and each other cease to exist. You \ncondemn MRA's but there has yet to be a single verified report of an MRA \nbeating up women, killing women, advocating rape or supporting rape. No MRA \nthat's vocal and considers himself an MRA advocates crime and property \ndamage, No MRA has ever organized a march and public protest where groups \nof men take to the streets calling for the legalization of rape. And time \nand time again feminists have been quick to hold MRAs responsible for acts \nof violence and articles against feminist movies that never included MRAs \nAnd given their rampant willingness to falsely accuse MRA's of things they \nnever did, its just a small leap to understand that women in general often \nlob false assault and rape accusations, much of which is never seriously \nreported or enter the statistical record. Most people know several agencies \ninvolved with organizing statistics are under pressure from advocacy groups \nto produce results preferable to the confirmation bias of a particular \ngroup like feminist, and  to secure future funding, the parameters \ngenerating the methodology used will often omit or distort and frequently \nignore salient factors that may minimize or magnify results to tailor them \nto fit the ideological expectations of (in this case) feminist misandrist. \n(Such as yourself.)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf6F8p7kzAcIKXVSEE0xVsw", "inappropriate_score": 1.1049723756906078, "authorDisplayName": "Jonathan Zargosky (J.Z.)", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12jixppfyu0ejagf04ccnkpdsr1gfwxnh0", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-30T03:34:10.541Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCf6F8p7kzAcIKXVSEE0xVsw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.40992600000000001, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-30T03:35:21.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kg7YvqQDj-k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAUU/vi06gowvIss/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116678928685922125862", "textDisplay": "+David Hendrickson \n\n*HAHA.

I need to \nread this stuff myself, because as you've shown, you kind of misunderstand \nfacts and data. Case in point, your claim about marital rape laws being \nenacted to protect women from men. How so? Prior to these marital rape \nlaws, it was written in law that MEN cannot rape a woman if she was his \nwife. It was enacted in the UK and came to be known as the \"Lord Hale \nDoctrine\", which was later written into US law (see Commonwealth vs \nFogarty). And it's widely known that during that same period that under the \nlaw, a wife was considered her husbands property. This wasn't some vague \nmetaphor either, a wife was literally and legally considered her husbands \nproperty. This is why marital rape was excluded from being treated as rape. \nWhen marital rape laws were made, it was meant to broaden the framework for \nwhat counted as rape, and was a reaction to these horribly sexist laws, not \nsimply to protect women against men. You left out the entire historical \ncontext these laws were made in! Why was there no mention of the Hale \nDoctrine, or the legal recognition of women being considered property of \ntheir husband? Why was there only the temporal comparison of marital rape \nlaws being enacted, and men being recognized as rape victims? The two were \nin very different legal contexts.\n\nOh my goodness, do you think the problem might be more complicated than \nMRAs like yourself have indicated? And, had you recognized the context \nthese marital laws were made in, it's pretty easy to see how that sort of \nrape would be enforcing patriarchal norms of male dominance and female \nsubordination. Good lord, she was seen as property of her husband, and thus \nhe wasn't even understood as raping her! There is not even a remotely \nsimilar story we can tell about male rape victims. Men were never legally \nunderstood as property of their wives. Moreover, what data are you \nreferring to when you say \"women do it to men as often as men do it to \nwomen\"? All the data I've read do NOT suggest this, and I study this stuff \nfor a living. I think you might have misread some of the research."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ", "inappropriate_score": 2.3529411764705883, "authorDisplayName": "Mentalidade Logica", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xdxcb4meyxpwve23getxgvpqwvt55i04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-25T23:46:44.809Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.41310399999999997, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-25T23:46:44.809Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Iovrm_3Dd98/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/7rxb8F34Feo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110971639976441621198", "textDisplay": "+Light And Shadow\nI have said it all along that the law in the UK states penis=rapist, what \nelse do you need to know?\nTherefore one who has no penis can not legally rape, only force to \npenetrate,  a much lenient sentence."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mentalidade Logica", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xdxcb4meyxpwve23getxgvpqwvt55i04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-25T23:44:01.878Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.78903600000000007, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-25T23:44:01.878Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Iovrm_3Dd98/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/7rxb8F34Feo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110971639976441621198", "textDisplay": "+Carlos3Zone\nI came across once a couple of videos of an expert who has dealt with \nnumerous rape victims.\nShe claims that when it comes to the pleasure of inflicting pain, women \nhave better imaginations for it.

Self determinism is the same as accepting individual \nresponsibility for one's own rational benefit as a reasonable priority. You \nsay MGTOWs are divisive, how is it divisive to realize one has value and \nworth that no longer need validation by an inherently corrupt relational \nand institutional paradigm? You mention MGTOW is separatist in nature, yet \nhave you considered the present conditions that encourage greater \nseparation between men and women via, hordes of feminist advocacy groups \nwhose main preoccupation is to push more punitive crackdowns on men, pursue \ncompulsory behavior modification and maintain a societal standard where men \nare constantly told to navigate a zero sum principle that guarantees only \ndiminishing returns?\n\n\nMGTOW won't lose a battle, because essentially MGTOW no longer engage in \nthe features of societal conditional relationships with most western women \nfrom which a battle is often the standard. MGTOW takes away the \nunderpinning that leads to bitterness, resentment, pathology which often \nresults tin the very self-destructive behavior so many feminist love to \nlevel against men but never themselves. \n\n\nYou refer to them as butthurt manchildren. Yet how can this be when the \nmethodology behind MGTOW involves self determination/self responsibility \nfor one's own betterment? Isn't that one of the most adult things a ma man \ncan do?\n\n\nNo one has a problem expressing every day, every minute of the day how \n\"evil\" men are. And most of western society has allowed the \"evil Man\" \nlabel to be pushed with impunity by feminists and western women and sadly \nother men. Do you believe some women can't be evil? Would you call a father \nwhose children was murdered by his wife or girlfriend in a vindictive rage, \n\"Butthurt\" because he cried about how \"evil\" the mother of his children was \nfor cold-blooded murder? Do you believe no woman has ever manipulated, \ndeceived and ruined good men? Do you believe a natural anger at being used \nand mistreated is aberrant if a man expresses it?\n\n\nMGTOW has no ambitions to change \"things\" MGTOW has ambitions to change the \nself through realizing a more cohesive and self-elevating idea of personal \nworth and value. \n\n\nMGTOW quickly eliminates the underpinnings leading to bitterness and hurt \nby de-prioritizing unnecessary relationships with the present general \nwestern woman, which is one of the greater causal factors for bitterness \nand hurt.\n\n\nMGTOW don't practice gender separatistism, modern feminism pushed gender \nseparatism in most institutions governmental, social and civic by pushing \nan ideology that reduced through absolutism and oversimplification a gender \nnarrative that labeled women=good, man=bad. When you're told you're always \nthe problem and you're not wanted long enough, its only logical to either \nreorient to a healthy life without them, or continue to exist within a \nsystem that has nothing but contempt for you."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuvD2wagQBElE9tqQbu_4vg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "blackburn9", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12mwdkqcqjptzeh504cgz2aamjwvllxhkc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-20T21:35:57.907Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuvD2wagQBElE9tqQbu_4vg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.44843000000000005, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-20T21:35:57.907Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103497919106250390923", "textDisplay": "+KingLink95 MGTOWs generally aren't bashing women, most simply articulate \nthe level of entitlement within western women is a society that refuses to \nhold them accountable, or responsible with consequences for their \nexploitation of men for one-sided gain.

Feminist in the U.S. operate \non  a variant of the Marxist principle of class conflict. Instead of the \nproletariat/workers as the oppressed and the Czarists as the oppressors, \nfeminist hold that men as a collective gender are the oppressors and women \nare the oppressed. And as the oppressed, which means that any complaint or \nsuffering of the so-called male oppressor is not only irrelevant but \ninvalid as a result of \"privilege.\" Only the issues of the \"oppressed\" is \nto be prioritized and any solution that operates on a model of damage to \nthe so-called \"oppressor\" is the only model from which any progress can be \ndeemed viable for the female oppressed. The most common version of this \nwithin feminist ideology is the frivolous and incorrect connotation of \npatriarchy. In feminist reckoning patriarchy has nothing to do with any \nsystemic institutionalized norms that is motivated by oppressing women to \nbenefit men,but everything to do with collectively associating the entire \nmale gender as a pathological misogynist  identity to whose feet all blame \npast present and future is laid. Patriarchy/the collective blame of all men \nis the simplistic explanation to every social ill in the world which allows \nfeminist to externalize and offset onto the male gender even their frequent \ncontributions to social and criminal culpability.\n\nTherefore feminist have no problem believing that all men in the present \nshould be held economically and monetarily libel/responsible for real or \nperceived  grievances of the distant past and present.\n\nActually feminist succeeded in an all male tax decades ago. its called \nTitle IX, the elimination of due process for men accused of rape and sexual \nassault, VAWA, alimony, Funding through tax dollars women's only government \nprograms in education, abortion, women's shelters, female contraceptives, \nquota systems  that discriminate against men, an ongoing paradigm that \nplaces 99% of all financial burden on men who seek to date or marry. and on \nand on and on. realistically in America men don't have rights in regards to \nwomen.

If \nthe existence of the slave plantation society depends on the exploitation \nof ill treated slaves or even requires slaves to begin with, why should an \nescaped slave care about the destruction of the plantation class? It \ndoesn't make sense except to the plantation owners who chiefly benefit from \nbrutal exploitation of slaves. Similarly what is the sense of contributing \nand preserving a society that requires men to accept mindless sacrifice \nbrutal conditions and indifferent government and a highly prejudicial court \nsystem as proof of virtue? \n\nMGTOWs aren't interested in banging drums and protesting in parades or \nseeking to appeal the mainstream media or ingratiate themselves into \nuniversity academia or submitting articles defending themselves. They \ncommunicate with each other and quietly disengage. And despite the feminist \nanti-male narrative demonizing them they still refuse to marry, have \nchildren or engage in any activity that requires unnecessary assistance or \npriority to any facet of western women's lives. In other words they no \nlonger submit to a zero sum feminist social paradigm that has no area \nwithin it that recognises their humanity beyond a living resource to \nexploit without any modicum or equal reciprocation. If that implies the \npossible destruction of society in the future, it can't be any worse for \nmen than the present conditions of a feminist gynocracy that already makes \nthe mistreatment and indifference to men's issues, pain or suffering the \nnorm. \n\nNo marriage no divorce no divorce no alimony no children no child support \nno children no taking them out of the father's life no dating no false rape \ncharge no living with women no loss of home no spending money on women no \nloss of viable assets no emotional investment in western women no \nfoundation for self destructive psychological pathologies no unnecessary \ninteracting socially with women in a manner of developing a relationship no \nrejection no rejection no foundation for bitterness. No slaves no \nplantation . All other alternatives for men going there own way suggests \nonly self determination and self improvement. Despite your invective you \nhave nothing better to offer so your perspectives on MGTOWs from the MGTOWs \nstandpoint is meaningless."}}]}, "z13oubkhwxy4il2gu04cfvpoysqvstswyeg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAMZyhMA2SfUqNmdY3TTXDQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dWOxTJJJtzw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPg/yI3sWjKIeTE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Charles Lott", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-15T23:07:29.605Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAMZyhMA2SfUqNmdY3TTXDQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.81584769999999995, "formal_score": 87, "updatedAt": "2014-12-15T23:07:29.605Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113415355008320661979", "textDisplay": "This is a terrible title...men's rights is real...rape victims don't \ndeserve it, however fact is men are exploited by many systems...please \nchange the title you do good work and don't need to sucker people in.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12pubnz1rrkvtbca22kijii2kmxvxhfh": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTFD7Wp1hyVBsUxEAwn3CQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OT52niVsmXQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/w7A0Jz5Kos8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.50761421319796951, "authorDisplayName": "kodankodan", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-12T16:30:30.588Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHTFD7Wp1hyVBsUxEAwn3CQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.77021399999999995, "formal_score": 67, "updatedAt": "2014-09-12T16:30:30.588Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100598833675050047225", "textDisplay": "I generally like VICE, but this was a piece of biased bullshit.

Horticultural societies are ones where food was grown via planting \nwith your hands or a digging stick. In such civilisations, there were an \nequal number of male and female gods. Men and women both had roughly equal \nlevels of social respect. Great mother religions saw women as very \npowerful. Why? Because that technology created civilization structures \nwhere women WERE powerful. The cultural beliefs and genetic express \nreflected this fact.\n\nThen the technology advanced, and an animal drawn plough was the cutting \nedge. This greatly increase food production. However, unlike before, men \nwere significantly better suited to this. Why? Because it's hard physical \nwork, large animals and a plough are demanding to operate and a pregnant \nwoman was much more likely to miscarry if she did this work. That creates a \nvery different world to the previous one where planting could be done \nequally be men and women. Suddenly, 90% of the gods are male. Men are seen \nas more powerful (because they WERE better at producing food). Surpluses \nalso lead to the ability to go to war and gain more territory / resources. \nMen were put in charge of this by society, because men were better at it.\n\nThen comes the industrial revolution, combustion engine, electricity, \nscience etc. Suddenly it's not so much about physical strength, rather the \nmind. It also frees up more resources to spread education and end slavery. \nThe strict roles of men and women began changing.\n\nNow we have the information age, where the dominant force isn't just the \nmind, it's also the ability to network and connect and communicate. Women \narguably have an advantage there, or at the absolute minimum are even.\n\nMany people and ideas (and social structures) are still stuck in long \nsurpassed positions. Fundamentalist Christianity was the cutting edge 1000 \nyears ago. Now it seems ancient.\nBut the forces are still lingering. People see that actually women can do \nthe vast majority of jobs, they don't have to stay at home if they don't \nwant to.\n\nOf course, most people are completely unaware of this ongoing natural \nevolution in culture and systems and morality. They just see that some \npeople asserting very strict gender roles, when it is actually obvious that \nsuddenly women can also perform the opposite role. They come up with some \ntype of mental ideas about why it was so in the past. The most obvious \nchange is in women's ability to work and participate in the outside world.\n\nThere has been a bigger shift in women's ability to work, than there has \nbeen in men's ability to be a parent. I think this is partly explained by \nwashing machines and schools freeing up women's time from being a mother. \nYet men's jobs still need to be done.\n\nThis changed occurred for women, so it feels like the old world was unjust \ntowards women.\n\nSo those people fight against the old roles, but it is bias towards \nexpanding women's roles.\nThe fact is, that the momentum of society is in supporting that direction. \nIt's not directly about what is fair or what is just, it is about what \nworks. Now it works for women to have expanded roles, and the idea that \nthis is just or fair or equal, flows on from this reality.\n\nBoth men and women have issues. Yet due to our human biology and past \nsocial structures we have a bias towards seeing men as agents, and women as \nobjects.\n\nAlso, gynocentrism is such an ingrained part of humanity, that focusing on \nwomen's issues (ie feminism) is where the momentum is.\nThere is a biological bias towards structuring society in a way that \nbenefits women, especially to protect and sustain their ability to have \nchildren.\n\nWhat is right, or just, or fair, is completely irrelevant to this trend. \nIt's not even about giving women a better or more fulling experience of \nlife. That is besides the point of the underlying trend and bias. Humans \nare just objects to this trend.\n\nMy point is, that in addition to biological bias, momentum towards \nexpanding women's roles. Hence, feminism.\n\nIn order to replace feminism, an idea, or culture, or social system, or \nbiology (or all 4), need to go beyond it.\n\nIn other words, take into account the biases and trends, and what the \nintent of feminism is, and come up with something better.\n\nI think that feminism is blind to the actual fairness of things. It's not \nabout that.\n\nBut I also think that people are not going to care about male DV victims \nunless a lot of progress is made for female victims.\nWe have a bias towards keeping women safe.\n\nI know that the damage is the most severe when it's reciprocal between \npartners.\nBy having a campaign that says \"Don't ever hit women\", it's aligning with \nbiases that make men less likely to hit. Yes that is asking the men to be \nleaders, yes it treats the women like children, but that is the \nsubconscious belief that the whole thing is based on.\n\nI do think that this does reduce the number of male DV victims overall.\n\nThings like abortion rights are still being contested. This is such an old \nissue. Is it any wonder that men's issues are not taken seriously when such \nan obvious issue is still being fought for? The lack of progress on issues \nsuch as this, has a direct impact on feminism's apparent need for existence.\n\nBasically, I think that society is progressing pretty much as you would \nexpect.\n\nMy intitial point had been that by improving life for women, feminism will \nindirectly benefit men.\n\nWhile I think that is true to an extent... I can see how it's seriously \nflawed as well, because blaming men for issues which both sexes created \nalso causes injustice and resentment. Which isn't exactly a healthy way \nforward."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mentalidade Logica", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qzz1gupqxehxfu22zgdix1oufilqoj04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-25T18:34:01.343Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.098765999999999965, "formal_score": 14, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-25T18:34:01.343Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Iovrm_3Dd98/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/7rxb8F34Feo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110971639976441621198", "textDisplay": "+Thomas Moore\nMaybe you want to back feminists claim that, it is much easier too:\n\n1) women were systematically oppressed by the mythical patriarchy?\n2) women historically fought such oppression?\nA name of gender wars or women cemeteries would do the trick.\n3) what law exists that prevents any women from doing the same as a man?\n\nFeminists pay gap  = myth, already debunked even by a feminist.\n\nFeminists surely like to travel and cause pain, don't you?

But while feminism \nhas done some great things for society it has also become toxic because of \nthe growing extremism being born from it. Standing up against unfair \ntreatment of men is now considered sexist. A woman can surprise a man with \na kid he never knew he had and demand almost two decades of child support. \nAll a woman needs to do is lie about birth control or sabotage a condom to \ndestroy a man's life. Ultimately women carry the child for nine months so \nthey get to choose whether or not to abort. That, to me is a no brainer. If \na man tricks a woman into getting pregnant she has the right to terminate \nthe pregnancy. But if a woman tricks a man he has no rights and no way out.\nThen there are the double standards. If a woman expects her male partner to \npleasure her because she has pledged her faithfulness to him with the \nexception he satisfy her to the best of his ability it's okay. If a woman \ncriticizes a man's performance or body (penis size, for example) it's fine. \nBut vice versa it's misogyny. A woman hitting a man is okay or even \nshameful for the man but a man hitting a woman is abuse. A woman having \ncopious amounts of lovers, even while in a 'monogamous' relationship (yes, \nI do have someone specific in mind when I say that) is empowering but a man \nhaving copious amounts of lovers makes him a pig; even if he's never \ncheated in his life.\nFeminism is NOT a man's movement even if a small minority do good things \nfor men. This is why I found myself in the unfortunate role of \nanti-feminist. I could go on but this is already way too long for a YouTube \ncomment.\n\nI'd also like to add that despite what feminist extremists say, trans women \nARE real women (and trans men ARE real men).\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12szl3ajljhu3oaa04ccrwhmnrlghnao2c": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4z_q2e1Cl_83Kobwux49tg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Eve Pastiche De J\u00e9sus", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-21T05:35:58.382Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4z_q2e1Cl_83Kobwux49tg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.19588999999999995, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-10-21T05:36:30.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109741368120267496193", "textDisplay": "Men's rights women's rights animal rights earth rights government rights \ncitizen rights human rights homosexual rights heterosexual rights racial \nrights children's rights elderly rights.

I think that it's wrong women \nare paid less than men and I believe no means no. Conversely, if you act in \na manner that attracts negativity you are also equally culpable. \n\nFor instance, it is illegal for someone to steal your car. It's also \nillegal to leave your keys in the ignition unattended. In parallel if you \nrape or sexually assault someone its illegal and disgraceful. I don't \nbelieve it should be illegal to act sluty but, don't be surprised if you \nare a victim. Rape is always wrong, don't try to twist my words. \n\nHowever, if you are a parent and don't use a car seat and a drunk driver \nslams into your car killing your child it's the sole fault of the drunk \ndriver. If a straight man wearing ass less chaps gets wasted at a gay bar \nand gets raped its wrong. Its also wrong to go out become incoherent and \nwhat would you expect with ass less chaps?\n\nNow, these are parallels not because I'm pro drunk driving or homophobic, \nrather I believe wearing sexualy provocative clothing and not taking \nresponsibility for your own actions is partly responsible. Should you \nfinger a drunk girl no! Why? Not because, she was making out with you, \nrather because it's rape.\n\nSo don't be a slut, or a drunkard, don't wear ass less chaps, use car \nseats, and get a notarized waiver before any sexual interaction. The idea \nthat we live in a Rape culture is disgusting and sad. I don't know any men \nthat think Rape is ok. Real men want to be wanted and never think about how \nthey can force a woman into bed.\n\nSo let's be adults, look both ways before you cross the street. Tie your \nshoes. Drink responsibly and don't put your self in a bad situation. And, \nif something does happen and you are raped be mindful and review your \nbehavior. Chances are 999,999.9 out of a million its the rapists fault. \nHowever, 9 out of 10, your friends left you behind or you drank too much.\n\nDon't clean a loaded gun. Dont share needles. Use a seat belt. Don't get so \ndrunk you loose control of your faculties. Lock your house and car doors. \nUse a condom and take responsibility for your actions. I promise if you \nfollow these tips your chance of getting rapped will decrease \nsignificantly. \n\nGo ahead call me a rape apologist. I am not an apologist. I am using common \nsense and realistically looking at life. It takes two. Unless you rape \nyourself. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV1pbq2Qop7AWzrlyhK188A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "JAH \u201cKeeper of Ziongate\u201d RASTAFARI", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135fj3zzrqojd04404cehahiljijtpg3yg0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-09T22:18:19.656Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCV1pbq2Qop7AWzrlyhK188A"}, "sentiment_score": 0.11478000000000005, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-09T22:18:19.656Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NXQZyDEWuzg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABck/20w4D6me5UE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100257259077162666745", "textDisplay": "*its not the sole fault of the drunk driver if you don't use a seat belt or \ncar seat."}}]}, "z12rs3opnnmxy3ltx22telbaiuztuhe1h": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1OOepKMcFkTjfLFsmYum1g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kmkqhDDrVs8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFeE/EI8K8Q437ZE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 4.7619047619047619, "authorDisplayName": "Matthew Turner", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-05T17:34:31.706Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1OOepKMcFkTjfLFsmYum1g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.83404029999999996, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-05T17:34:31.706Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112286082091462857599", "textDisplay": "The funny thing is woman are attracted to bad asses haha.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13hs3jppr3puhuoq04cgnkjbzi2wviawho": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTyYyk3YbpudF3cXzBYATBA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UHygm5fZV58/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAG8/CdrZrTolE0U/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Savannah", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-23T21:21:31.992Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTyYyk3YbpudF3cXzBYATBA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.90018200000000004, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2015-06-23T21:21:31.992Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106097373056660026942", "textDisplay": "I love how feminism is put under one light.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13nzjbi3kvzx13wc04cix54dmi3jviizpk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgtVrFk3cQZjEcuGfFrIbtA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bffaIHOzPCo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAIkY/IOA-dTE-1pQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Joel Wiapo", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-11T09:30:28.519Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgtVrFk3cQZjEcuGfFrIbtA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.51494200000000001, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-10-11T09:30:28.519Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116253106372436072937", "textDisplay": "What's the name for someone who wants equality for everyone?

I don't know what \nencounters you might have had with some handful of people calling \nthemselves feminists that made you lump such a vast array of ideologies \ntogether into a single idea that feminists are essentially a bunch of \noversensitive bra-burning hate mongers (that's essentially the antifeminist \nnarrative). I have followed Karen (@girlwriteswhat) initially for a while \nwhen I didn't realise what feminism was all about, not because I subscribed \nto the idea of modern feminism most in North America tend to have, but I \nfound a female standing up for men's issues refreshing (still subscribed to \nher channel...I think). But then I educated myself more on the feminist \nworldview and found many flaws on how Karen and the rest of the people here \nin YouTube show feminists to be. I have NEVER come across all these \nfeminists that I hear so much about - online OR offline (may be I need to \nspend more time in the US idk), and I don't even find the critiques by \nthese antifeminists here very intellectually honest - some hover around \nsemantics a little too much, some deny the existence of patriarchy, some \nare ignorant, while some are just flat out misogynists (religious and \natheists alike). I guess I went off topic too, well I can't help it much.\n\n\n*Talking to different people can help you grow* Agreed. You're the second \nonly person that's not either of cis/straight/white/male kind that seem to \noppose feminists, first being a gay guy I encountered online who had \nsimilar reasons - his experiences with some feminists, and not of what he \nmight understand most feminists stand for. \n\n\nMy original comment was merely my observation that almost only straight \nwhite women tend to be so actively \"against feminism\", which is a pattern \nand I think I get why that is. This is a group that are among the top \nhierarchy in the social construct among females, and it's not surprising \nthey are not empathetic about any oppressed group, let alone notice within \ntheir own group. This actually applies to those radical feminists as well; \nand both groups are a miniscule minority among women, fact (a vast majority \nbeing religious and/or traditionalist women around the world who are \noblivious to the harms of patriarchy).\n\n\n*You have decided this for me, and I'm dumb until I agree with you, or \nsomething like that, right?*\nI don't really care about you agreeing with me, whatever works for ya. But \nthis has worked more the other way round in my case. I have been called a \nwhite knight (coz apparently I can get laid with a woman through the \ninternet), mangina, pussy, faggot etc. Oh and none of the feminists have \nused that ever (not at all surprising). I'm intrigued as to how much do you \nconform to the patriarchal norm that makes you side with the ones \nsupporting the social status quo, or is it only and only based on your \nfeminist encounters? what about what you stand for, do they not at all \ncoincide with the feminist worldview. Please respond to this if you have an \nopen mind (read: well researched opinion) about feminism itself; also do \nlook up \"intersectional feminism\".\n\n\n\n*The point is, you're not looking at both sides here. You don't know what \nthese women think, who they are, and how and what the things they say mean \nto them.*\nI think I am looking at both sides, being a cis straight (semi-white) male \nand all. I can see how men would feel it's selfish on feminist's part not \nto focus on men's issues enough, while being expected to think of women's \nissues. But what they fail to see is the need of gender equity, and how \nequality benefits everyone. As a trans person I would assume that your \nnarrative is more similar to that, which makes more sense in your case as \nbeing a transgendered couldn't be easier than being a woman (sometimes it \ndoes, sometimes it doesn't). As a feminist I'm not trying to proselytize; \nit's a personal choice and shapes from how progressive your mindset has \nbeen. If you believe you'd rather be an MRA or Antifeminist, I'll be \npuzzled, but again, hey whatever works for ya.\n\n\n*Talking to different people can help you grow* Yup, especially when the \nother person is less likely to be condescending and more likely to be \nmature, which I believe you are so far."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmG8lL3lF7j10zKCrEZ8CrA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Terkas", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z120cn542wyyetdod04cft3qezehuj1bkiw", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-09T00:00:03.075Z", "likeCount": 12, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmG8lL3lF7j10zKCrEZ8CrA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.33485000000000004, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-09T00:00:03.075Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8e4WO1WoyXg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEY/TQH8N-w0ohQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109313836056073497799", "textDisplay": "+atinb What part am I lying about?

If that (completely insane) idea was brought in, you \nwould end up with at least two consequences:\n\nMany people who had crimes committed against them wouldn't want to risk \ngoing to the law, but would either let it slide (leading to an increase in \ncrime) or would turn to vigilante revenge (also leading to an increase in \ncrime).\n\nWhere a crime did go to court, the jury would probably be more likely to \nfind the defendant guilty rather than risk the victim of a serious crime \nlike rape being punished for reporting an attack and becoming a victim \ntwice over.\n\nThink about this. Suppose someone steals money off you. You press charges \nbut when it comes to court, the jury decides they can't decide 'beyond \nreasonable doubt' that that person took your money.

Let me try to spell it out as simply as \npossible:\n\n1) If there is strong evidence for a rape, then it should go to trial, even \nthough the evidence might not ultimately convince the jury 'beyond \nreasonable doubt' - the whole point of due process.\n\n2) If there is strong evidence for a false accusation, then it should go to \ntrial, even though the evidence might not ultimately convince the jury \n'beyond reasonable doubt' - the whole point of due process. This can and \ndoes happen, and people have been jailed for false accusations.\n\n3) What you apparently struggle to understand: where someone goes to trial, \nand is found not guilty because the evidence doesn't convince the jury \n'beyond reasonable doubt', that doesn't PROVE the witnesses and victims \nlied. It just shows that the evidence for convicting the defendant wasn't \n100% conclusive.\n\nNow I've answered your question (I think) answer mine. You witness a murder \nbut in the end the only evidence against the defendant is your testimony, \nand the court decides they don't trust you enough to reach a guilty \nverdict. Does that automatically mean you lied? Does it mean you deserve to \nbe punished for lying?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mentalidade Logica", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ifpq5gxaoctqha04chv0wmse0erbpcmk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-04T03:14:00.967Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPtpanp7eQP2M8gL6jbQ5sQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.62525199999999992, "formal_score": 16, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-04T03:28:28.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Iovrm_3Dd98/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/7rxb8F34Feo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110971639976441621198", "textDisplay": "+WeeFaolan\nJust answer my question!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdnNkCc8qQchaZAXQMVsevA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "WeeFaolan", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ifpq5gxaoctqha04chv0wmse0erbpcmk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-04T02:36:51.428Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdnNkCc8qQchaZAXQMVsevA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.60640000000000005, "formal_score": 96, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-04T02:36:51.428Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GYLjBQXmBVY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/L5c8Xf6qkks/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113964359443092884619", "textDisplay": "+Mentalidade Logica Are you being stupid on purpose?

Only after watching this do I appreciate how fair and impartial \nthose networks are, at least by comparison.  Some outlets spin pieces \ntoward their agendas.  You ball up your agenda in your fist and jam it down \nthe throats of your audience.\n\nYou are part of the reason that public trust in the media has never been \nlower.  Your cherry-picking and journalistic dishonesty are unparalleled in \nthe western world.  For example:\n-The title of this video is an outright lie, and is never even addressed \nwithin.\n-You wait for Elam to list the allegations against him and his organization \nand conveniently cut the shot *immediately* before he goes on to discredit \nthose allegations.\n-In a moment of monumental stupidity, you point out the violent phrases in \nElam's \"Bash a Violent Bitch Month\" article *while he is telling you that \nthe article was nothing but a gender-swap based on a Jezebel article.*  And \nyou went for it hook, line, and sinker, thus proving Elam's point for him \n(that the double-standard exists).  I would compare your awareness to that \nof a rock, but rocks have some value in the world and I wouldn't do them \nthe disservice.\n-You brazenly take Straughan's statement, \"I guess we play Malcolm X to \nother peoples' Martin Luther King, Jr.\" completely out of context.  I have \nheard her use this analogy before, and I am certain that you heard it in \nits entirety at the time.  But who has time for context or fairness when \nyou have a bias to maintain?\n-Throughout, you paint the picture that AVFM and the MRM in general are \ndisorganized sexists simply because they don't toe the mainstream feminist \nline, and tell inconvenient truths that handily discredit your clear \nagenda.  And don't even bother with the dictionary definition of feminism \nto try to suggest that anyone who isn't feminist is sexist, because actions \nspeak louder than words.\n\nThis is supposedly a \"profile\" of anti-feminists.  Yet you see fit to \ninterview a feminist whose only possible purpose for appearing is to convey \nthe message, \"Don't give these people an audience.\"  Again, this would be a \nsneaky move if you weren't so ham-handed and obvious in its delivery.\n\nDespite the fact that in order to feel shame one must have an iota of \nscruples, you should be ashamed of yourselves, Vice.  You might be hacks \nand peddlers of propaganda if you could even pull that off, but you \ncouldn't convince someone drowning in a puddle to do a push-up.  Your \nintelligence, integrity, and honesty are imaginary at best.\n\nPlease go out of business in a grandiose blaze of disapprobation.  The \nsooner and the more personally humiliating for everyone involved in the \nexcretion of your insidious filth, the better off the world will be.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13dylmqcoa2dv0zg04cfv0rymjji5chpfw": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdMlDY0szE3uYGfnYq0iUmQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fr9lBe-kydo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/FBu3OZ-G_10/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ionpvp", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-15T17:51:13.723Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdMlDY0szE3uYGfnYq0iUmQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.49432199999999998, "formal_score": 42, "updatedAt": "2015-07-15T17:51:13.723Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100690904441268698563", "textDisplay": "Is this a joke\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13hsddqfvz5jvgnz23qvx2irvayhb4fc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOyn8Yltrg-Z97nhWIu5RiA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-of1L8C3mDpY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/6Y7jNt3J20A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.58479532163742687, "authorDisplayName": "Carlo Scrocca", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-28T03:14:56.723Z", "videoId": "M4PDFaRPKM0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOyn8Yltrg-Z97nhWIu5RiA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.39220799999999995, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2015-01-28T03:14:56.723Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116426359636453333988", "textDisplay": "The original meaning of feminism is that the individual believes that women \nand men should be treated equally.

I know this personally \nbecause even though I'm a man i was a victim of it from one of my ex's. \nThere are plenty of studies that have shown women to be more abusive than \nmen and in a more harmful way; namely emotionally and mentally. Think about \nit the case in the states where a man felt so overwhelmed and even bullied \nby the family court system when it came to his custody battle for his kids \nthat he finally snapped and set himself on fire on the court steps. There \nare also little to almost no battered men's shelters here in the US. Mary \nT. Cleary a former ER nurse started the first battered men's shelter in the \nUK after having many conversations with men who showed up in her care and \nthe men who did open up admitted that the bruises they had were not from \nanother man but from their gf/wife at the time. She has received death \nthreats for helping men in these situations. There was a story in the news \nrecently about a woman who raped a 15 year old boy and only had to serve \ntime on the weekends, if that was a man with an under aged girl they \nwould've thrown him in jail and threw away the key. The main reason so many \nMRA/MRM members are angry is not because we hate feminism, it's because we \nknow what it started as and we see what it has truly become, an easy way \nout for women who do heinous things. It's gotten so bad you can't even \ndisagree with a feminist without them calling it harassment of some sort. \nThey want to insult men and objectify men but if a man even says \"hello\" to \na woman on the street it's sexually harassing them if not in their minds \nflat out rape. We're angry at the double standards women are getting in \nsociety as a whole, lenient jail time for rape, being able to suck a man \ndry in through the court system, using his kids as a weapon against him, \nputting a man in jail on false accusations of rape and getting away with it \neven after it's been proven to be a lie; IE the Duke lacross rape case \nwhere the woman was found out to be lying about hte entire thing and she \ngot no time for it. A few months later she killed her bf and is now in \njail. And lastly the fact that they have the nerve to speak for every woman \nand treat all women as if they are children who can't speak for themselves."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuIEJBArLV9Por_1O1gKKRw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "katicopter", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13axt0bkkjmu132k22og3up2r2ijnr0t", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-30T06:43:22.177Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuIEJBArLV9Por_1O1gKKRw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.79630200000000007, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-30T06:43:22.177Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-focRSjE8UoI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACA/Hy9qXrPSj9k/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115006655078381835288", "textDisplay": "+PoetLG I apologize if I'm wrong, but I've never heard ANYTHING about \n\"femenazis\" ever RAPING an antifeminist.

At least second wave \nacknowledges that women aren't oppressed, there's no patriarchy, and the \npay gap is bullshit. \n\n*Understanding that the issues a black straight woman faces are different \nthan the ones a white lesbian faces, but believing that they are both equal \nand deserve basic human respects and rights.*\n\nSo that means you are a human rights advocate, not a feminist. Feminism =/= \nhuman rights. \n\n*Feminism sounds simple because anyone can claim to be one, but the hardest \npart about being a FEMINIST is understanding privilege and that our \nsociety, from government regulations down to school yard politics is \ndesigned to empower white men, and white men ONLY.*\n\nYou sure about that? \n\n*Examples of female privilege*\n1. Female privilege is being able to walk down the street at night without \npeople crossing the street because they\u2019re automatically afraid of you.\n\n2. Female privilege is being able to approach someone and ask them out \nwithout being labeled \u201ccreepy.\u201d\n\n3. Female privilege is being able to get drunk and have sex without being \nconsidered a rapist. Female privilege is being able to engage in the same \naction as another person but be considered the innocent party by default.\n\n4. Female privilege is being able to turn on the TV and see yourself \nrepresented in a positive way. Female privilege is shows like King of \nQueens and Everybody Loves Raymond where women are portrayed as attractive, \ncompetent people while men are shown as ugly, lazy slobs.\n\n5. Female privilege is the idea that women and children should be the first \nrescued from any sort of emergency situation. Female privilege is saving \nyourself before you save others and not being viewed as a monster.\n\n6. Female privilege is being able to decide not to have a child.\n\n7. Female privilege is not having to support a child financially for 18 \nyears when you didn\u2019t want to have it in the first place.\n\n8. Female privilege is never being told to \u201ctake it like a man\u201d or \u201cman up.\u201d\n\n9. Female privilege is knowing that people would take it as a gravely \nserious issue if someone raped you. Female privilege is being able to laugh \nat a \u201cprison rape\u201d joke.\n\n10. Female privilege is being able to divorce your spouse when your \nmarriage is no longer working because you know you will most likely be \ngranted custody of your children.\n\n11. Female privilege is being able to call the police in a domestic dispute \nknowing they will take your side. Female privilege is not having your \ngender work against where police are involved.\n\n12. Female privilege is being able to be caring or empathetic without \npeople being surprised.\n\n13. Female privilege is not having to take your career seriously because \nyou can depend on marrying someone who makes more money than you do. Female \nprivilege is being able to be a \u201cstay at home mom\u201d and not seem like a \nloser.\n\n14. Female privilege is being able to cry your way out of a speeding ticket.\n\n15. Female privilege is being favored by teachers in elementary, middle and \nhigh school. Female privilege is graduating high school more often, being \naccepted to more colleges, and generally being encouraged and supported \nalong the way.\n\n16. Female privilege being able to have an opinion without someone tell you \nyou\u2019re just \u201ca butthurt fedora-wearing neckbeard who can\u2019t get any.\u201d\n\n17. Female privilege is being able to talk about sexism without appearing \nself-serving.\n\n18. Female privilege is arrogantly believing that sexism only applies to \nwomen.\n\n*Now, on to legal privileges women enjoy that men do not*\n\n1. Women are the assumed victim of domestic violence when police respond, \neven if the man is the one who makes the call saying he was the one abused. \nAlso, that happens even though it has been shown that women are also the \nmajority abuser in domestic violence cases. This is called the Duluth \nModel. \n\n2. Women have the right to genital integrity. \n\n3. Women serve 63% less time in jail than men do. Women are also convicted \nalmost 3 times less in criminal cases. All of this is factored between men \nand women being charged for the same exact crime under the same exact \ncircumstances with people that have the same exact criminal records. \n\n4. If a woman wants to get an abortion and the future father wants to have \nthe baby, he has no right to the baby. If a woman wants to have the baby \nand the father doesn't want the baby, he is forced to support the child for \nthe next 21 years. \n\n5. Under the FBI definition, men cannot accuse a woman of raping him. This \nis done by the male being made to penetrate the woman. \n\n6.

There are so many \nfacets that various ideologies disagree on.  For example, some people still \nfollow second-wave feminism, which has garnered itself the reputation of \nbeing man-haters and for white women only.  This wave shamed women who \nenjoyed doing housework and who wanted to be housewives.  The present day \nfeminism is about equality and intersectionality.  Understanding that the \nissues a black straight woman faces are different than the ones a white \nlesbian faces, but believing that they are both equal and deserve basic \nhuman respects and rights.  Feminism sounds simple because anyone can claim \nto be one, but the hardest part about being a FEMINIST is understanding \nprivilege and that our society, from government regulations down to school \nyard politics is designed to empower white men, and white men ONLY.

I agree some feminists have strayed \nfrom the original meaning of feminism which is was and should still be \nequality. The reason why feminism became a thing was because women are \nbeing oppressed, raped, treated like garbage, and beat. In some countries I \nwould not be able to get an education and thats why we have feminism. I \nhave also never once thought a man could not get raped and I find it \nterrible that a man should feel inadequate for reporting it because whether \nyour a man or a woman it hurts to be treated like garbage. Another note the \nfact that you think being lesbian is a choice, that women are lesbians \nbecause they are feminists shows how closed minded you sick people are. I \nam also a lesbian and I have never thought that I was a feminist because I \nthink everyone should be equal everyone should be loved and everyone should \nbe treated with respect. Because I don't go around looking at women and \nundress them with my eyes because I know how that feels. I don't think \"hey \nshe's wearing a tiny skirt she obviously wants my attention\" because no she \ndoesn't, she likes what shes wearing and she feels beautiful. So don't tell \nme that this \"civil movement\" is nothing more than an excuse to rape or \nfeel like you are the better sex. and to the women who are part of this, it \nis excellent that you want to saay home that is awesome but for me I'd like \nthe choice, I would like the option to work, to be educated, to not be \nafraid of rape (even though I still am when I walk alone at 10 oclock \nwearing jeans and a sweater), to be viewed as a human being, and to know \nthat I don't need a man because I have my loving wife. So please stop \nthinking that all women just want to beat you or call you a rapist, because \nI have never once thought that about my friends who are a mix or straight \nguys and gay or even a man on the street unless he was staring for a bit \ntoo long.

There's a lot of people who tell me to shut up, because I'm \ntransmale, so male, so stfu, internalized misogyny, WHILE saying they're \nfighting for me. So I have to shut up while they say things that actually \nmake people mad at ME, because feminists say they speak for me! (while, at \nthe same time, you know, stfu). Not even talking about the fact that the \nTerfs exist, the Trans-Exclusive radical feminists, who take a lot of \neffort to make sure trans people don't have any rights so that people are \ntoo scared to transition, so that's another bad thing about feminism. And \nyou can't say \"those aren't feminist\" or \"not all feminists are like that\", \nbecause I will just not ever say I'm on the side of a group that wants me \nto stfu, and just die while they \"fight for my rights\".\n\nOh, and also, feminists keep saying equality, that's what it stands for, \nand this is true. BUT, you really need to dissect what the definition \nactually is. \"equality TO men\". So that means you first have to have the \nnotion in your head that men are superior to women, and THEN you lift women \nup so that they're equal and then there's \"equality for all\". So feminists \ndon't fight for mens rights, because then you would lift men up and \"the \ninequality will rise\". Do you get that feminists are not for mens rights? \nIt would be rather silly if they would, wouldn't it? Cus why call yourself \na feminist then, call yourself an egalitarian. And I'm sorry, I just don't \nhave this notion in my head that women aren't equal to men. They have the \nexact same rights, MORE rights than men even, and that's all you can ever \nask, so I don't get what more do you want? \nIf you really listen to what they have to say, and feminists always say men \nshould be allowed to express their feelings without being demonized for it *cough*I \nbathe in male tears*cough*that's so nice and equal*cough*, there's actually \na lot of stuff that they should definitely be concerned about.\n\nI think of a lot of equality like this: Would it still be ok if the genders \nwere reversed?\nYou already showed the answer with feminists/meninist: no, It wouldn't be \nok. Should feminists in that case not be allowed to get away with saying \nsuch things, or should men be allowed to say such things?\n\nRape, child rape, violence, cheating. These are all things women are \nwaaaaaay more likely to get away with, because of \"reasons\". Is this ok? \nWhen you look at all the OFFICIAL (not some blog post) numbers, most \nviolence from men and women is pretty much the same. Men are more \nphysically violent, women more emotional (I HATE you, I wish you would die, \ngo cry somewhere else) and hitting is ok too! but nope, men cant hit back, \ncus that would be too unfair. do you wan't equality or not? then don't hit \nin the first place. Rape is 50/50, tho it actually happens most between TWO \nWOMEN. Seriously, why don't feminists say something about that and just \nblame men? How is this save and equal?\nI can go on. But maybe, instead of just yelling right away, without \nobviously not even knowing what you're talking about since you didn't even \nknow meninism is a joke when all it takes is a google search, you can look \ninto the thing. And I mean yourself, not what some blogger or youtuber \ntells you. Because let me tell you, most of it are not facts.

Meanwhile, some countries actually pay for MGM in it's \nhealthcare. Moreover, we're seeing in the UK calls to have consensual, \nvoluntary piercing of the women's regions, by an informed, adult woman, \ndeemed FMG, but baby boys having their foreskins severed is still not only \nallowed, if I'm not mistaken, it's covered under their healthcare. Keep \nthat in mind when you respond...keep in mind what some goverments are \nwilling to classify as genital mutilation when it's done to a grown woman \nwith her consent, compared to what's done to new born boys.\n\n\"So to blame feminists for circumcision is ridiculous.\"\n\nDon't mistake pointing out hypocrisy for leveling blame. The blame for \ncreating and enforcing MGM falls on the heads of religions. But feminism \nhas done absolutely nothing to help address it, even when they were (and \nstill are) actively campaigning to address FGM. Moreover, many actually \noppose speaking to the issue, and will attempt to silence any mention of \nit... even going so far as to say there is abslutely no comparison, and \ndaring to speak to MGM takes away from addressing FGM (again, despite there \nbeing a ban on FGM almost everywhere, putting it way ahead on the \"getting \naddressed\" scale compared to MGM).

It is only a major problem in the febrile minds of \nfeminists.'\n\n\nA few days later, Purdy released a document arguing for more attention to \nbe paid to adult male victims of domestic violence. This was immediately \nafter he had argued that domestic violence was natural and only a problem \n'in the febrile minds of feminists', who he felt should 'shut up'.

They are too busy \nwhinging because women get the vote without the tiny, theoretical risk of \nbeing forced into combat. The implication, which the likes of Paul Elam \noften get very close to, is that women don't deserve the vote at all.\n\n\nSociety was never 'gynocentric'. If it were, women would have high status, \nand lots of power. The truth is that they have historically been treated as \nproperty, and as intellectually and morally inferior beings. You really \nneed to read up on history to see the way women have been excluded from \nwider society and generally looked down upon and despised. This is still \nthe case in countries where feminism has not made much progress. MRAs tend \nto look at old chivalric stories in which a tiny number of young women were \n'put on pedestals' by a small number of men, but even those women had no \nreal power, and were being treated as desirable possessions. They couldn't \nin their turn put men on pedestals and go out on adventures trying to win \ntheir love. \n\n\nAnd once again I see you are conflating mild discipline with 'child abuse', \nwhich in most people's eyes is serious physical, sexual or emotional \nassault.

A person can \nbe aggressive without being physically violent. Yes, I can see how a more \naggressive personality might make someone more successful at the top levels \nof business or politics, although interpersonal skills and general smarts \nare important too. The same logic, about aggression being the key to \nsuccess, shouldn't apply to the majority of professions. I'm all for women \nbeing more assertive, as opposed to aggressive, and that is, I think, a \nfeminist issue - women have traditionally been socially conditioned into a \npassive role. \n\nDo you understand statistics? You showed me evidence that a cashier has a 2 \nin 100,000 chance of dying at work in one year. That means an individual \ncashier has a 0.002% chance of dying at work in a particular year. A \nwarehouse worker on the other hand has a 7 in 100,000 chance or a 0.007% \nchance of dying at work. The difference, in real terms, is 0.005%. In other \nwords, both a cashier and a warehouse worker would have to be extremely \nunlucky to be killed at work. Both occupations are actually very safe. \n\nIn case you still don't get it, let me use an example I saw in Ben \nGoldacre's book about media approaches to science. Someone released \nstatistics to show that taking a certain pill increased the risk of heart \nattack by 100%. The media were all over it: this pill doubles your risk of \nheart attack! So people stopped taking the pill, which was for some other \ncondition, and they began to die of the other condition. What was the \ntruth? The pill did increase the risk of heart attack by 100%... from about \n0.01% to 0.02%. It was still a tiny, tiny risk. 'Doubled' or '100% \nincrease' made it sound far more dramatic than it actually was. This is \nexactly what you are doing with your cashier versus warehouse statistics.\n\nYour argument about having to bribe people to do risky jobs is also \ndubious. At least in the UK, there are scores of people competing for every \nlow skilled job on offer. Warehouse work is ideal for someone whose \naptitudes lie in physical work rather than the more social/cognitive work \nat the cash till. An infinitesimal risk factor (0.007% for Chrissake!) is \nnot going to put people off.\n\nAt any rate, your stats also clearly showed that risk at work doesn't \nequate to higher wages. Otherwise why aren't fishermen and infantry \nsoldiers millionaires?\n\nAs for me thinking women are stupid and want protection? I didn't say that. \nYou say I can't see my own arguments. I think you're making up the \narguments you want to see. Go and Google 'straw man arguments'."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyMrYUzTbD2CRst7n4znOyA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Light And Shadow", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12gvdujhtvcvprea22lxfeo0xahsz1tf", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-23T16:30:05.332Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCyMrYUzTbD2CRst7n4znOyA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.48084199999999999, "formal_score": 55, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-23T16:30:05.332Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111363612562286748966", "textDisplay": "+WeeFaolan\n\n\n\"Nothing that you've said there is relevant to the point about male \nviolence made above.\"\n\nIt's not my fault you can't make the connections I am pointing out.

When violence is channeled \npositively it becomes drive and determination.\n\nOf course you say that \"Oh no, it's not women's lack of brute force \n(physical force, psychological force and determination, willingness to take \nrisks, roll the dice and put it all on the line etc) that makes women less \nsuccessful in business, politics, science, leadership etc (while also \nmaking them less likely to completely fail at life) , no it is cultural \nroles and oppression\".\n\nBut then of course you deny the existence of cultural roles and oppression \nas having any influence on men's behavior. Because men are inherently \nviolent (in your opinion), and apparently have no inherent positive \nqualities.\n\nYou point to all the (mostly) male serial killers, but not the (mostly) \nmale geniuses.\n\nThe only way that these views make sense is if you start with the initial \nassumption that women are helpless little damsels in distress and it's up \nto big strong powerful men (presumably like you) to save them.\n\n\n\"Or to put it another way, cashiers have a 0.002% chance of dying in any \none year while stock movers have a 0.007% chance. These are not exactly \nhigh risk factors, and it isn't clear from the statistics you provide that \nthe deaths are caused by the work itself.\"\n\nReally? That is your position? that a cashier has a 1 in 50,000 chance of \ndieing in any one year? You really think that isn't just at work?

(From what I found relatively serious \ninjuries among warehouse workers is around 1 in 30 and cashiers is around 1 \nin 60. Warehouse workers from slips falls, sprains etc, cashiers from RSI)\nBut I don't think you actually care about the actual reality, not if it \ngoes against your biases.\n\nYou are so convinced of how stupid women must be, and how much they need \nbig strong men to protect them, that you can't seem to acknowledge that \njust maybe there are factors outside of pay, and that women are often \nexerting their own power of choice. That just maybe it's not such a bad \ndeal to be paid slightly less for the sake of seriously reducing your \nchances of physical harm. No way, women can't have their own power that \nthey are exerting, after they must be saved and protected by men.\n\nThat's why you say \"Women are more risk adverse\" and then say \"Job X and \njob Y are roughly as strenuous\", when actually is least 2 times as \ndangerous as the other.\n\nThat fact that those jobs are actually NOT the same in terms of risk, and \nthat BY YOUR OWN LOGIC would mean women would be less willing to do them. \nLess supply of labour, higher price.
