Is a consistent sense of morality really evident in \nall religious texts?

So it would seem that even on the most fundamental issues, \nreligions can't seem to agree. I would like to think humanity has \nprogressed further in our understanding of morality than ideas that were \nwritten down hundreds of years ago. \nAnd I also think attempts to derive an absolute sense of morality are very \nevident throughout philosophy, without the need for a God to justify \nbeliefs. Kant has a famous Categorical Imperative, which employs reason to \nattain an absolute moral law, while possibly a more well-known absolute can \nbe seen in utilitarianism. These philosophies are generally much more \nnuanced and highly debated than many religious texts, and it is clear that \ndebate refines and improves ideas.\nThe reason we agree on morality 'more often than not' is an evolutionary \none. We have evolved as social beings and have come to a generally \nuniversal conclusion on what is right and what is wrong. A good example of \nthis conclusion is the UN definition of human rights.

To the extent that the British \ndid not in fact use similar violence to prevent India from gaining \nindependence, I suggest that some explanation be looked for other than the \n\"nonviolence of the British.\" It is possible the British ruling elite did \nnot fear Indian independence as much as Kenyan. Perhaps the British elite \nthought they would continue to make money in India even if it were formally \nindependent (as is the case today: \nhttp://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/india-clears-vodafone/938296.html \n.)Perhaps the British elite thought Kenyan independence would be more \ncostly, or perhaps the substantial number of \"white\" British people settled \nin Kenya was a factor.

Other than being completely exterminated by them of \ncourse? what good would it have done the Jews to be \"non violent\" against \nthe Nazis? none whatsoever? does it occur to you that sometimes non \nviolence is worse than violence, as in this case? of what possible use is \nnon violence if it allows a madman to conquer the world, and the only way \nto have prevented that is by the use of violence?\n\n             and I never said that Emma was any kind of \"mastermind.\" that \nwould be a good trick for a young foolish woman.\nNo, rather Emma Watson is merely a dupe and tool of those feminists who \nwould use her naivete and celebrity to further their own nefarious agenda.\nSo \"masterminds\" is not the issue.\nAdolf Hitler and his henchman were the masterminds of the Holocaust during \nthe Third Reich. but it is his minions, namely the SS, the Wehrmacht, \ncollaborators, and almost the entire brainwashed German population of tens \nof millions who aided Hitler in his barbarous objectives. the fact that \nthese minions were not the \"masterminds\" does not absolve them of guilt for \nhaving carried out Hitler's orders.\n      Just as Emma Watson and her ilk are also brainwashed minions of the \n\"masterminds\" of the radical feminist movement like Betty Friedan, Eleanor \nSmeal, Gloria Steinem et al.\nbut this also does not absolve her of responsibility of unwittingly \nallowing herself to be used as a tool to further the contemptible agenda \nknown as \"feminism.\"\nShe is guilty as the German population was guilty, even though neither were \n\"masterminds.\"\nthat's an irrelevant point.\nand Stefan most certainly fingers the government as the collaborator of the \nfeminist movement by biasing the court system toward women and against men. \nby making it possible for women to be supported by the government, and \ntherefore making it easy for woman to initiate divorcing their husbands for \nreasons such as \"dissatisfaction\" since they are no longer dependent on \ntheir husbands financially, and have no reason to keep them around if they \ndo not wish to. and I don't see the evidence that the government is the \n\"mastermind\" behind the feminist movement any more than simply \ncollaborating. The government did not manipulate Betty Friedan into writing \nThe Feminine Mystique.\nso what you are saying isn't really true.\nI have come across flaws in Stefan's reasoning as well, witness his bone \nheaded assertions regarding the \"Palestinian\"-Israeli conflict.\nbut vis a vis feminism, he has been absolutely right on. I have yet to find \na flaw in his logic regarding this. Just because he hates his mother, and \nmay be entirely justified in doing so, that is no reason to assume that \nthat is the reason he attacks feminism per se, a loathsome movement that \nhas contributed heavily to the decline of Western civilization, if ever \nthere was one.\nGood day to you as well."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMcm6tTz-brZGJDTcMknmg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "vaLLarrr", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13yer2g2nzoy3kvq22cdxhwsviqxhirw04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-05T13:25:19.876Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUMcm6tTz-brZGJDTcMknmg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.84415989999999996, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-05T13:25:19.876Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117221233357395156485", "textDisplay": "ok sure thing. thanks for being courteous."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMcm6tTz-brZGJDTcMknmg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "vaLLarrr", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13yer2g2nzoy3kvq22cdxhwsviqxhirw04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-05T12:48:05.780Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUMcm6tTz-brZGJDTcMknmg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.450936, "formal_score": 61, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-05T13:00:16.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117221233357395156485", "textDisplay": "+The LostBoys\n          did it ever occur to you that Gandhi's adherence to an absolute \nsystem of non-violence is sheer madness? and that it is a philosophy that \nSHOULD be contradicted?

Colonialism did not bring benefits to the \ncolonial mother-countries as a whole (for the most part); it brought \nbenefits to certain elite *sections* of the mother-countries.\n\nColonialism was an absolute disaster for India. To take just one example, \nIndia suffered about a dozen famines through the period of British rule, \nthe last one occurring in Bengal in 1943. Since independence in 1947, there \nhave been no famines, despite the fact that there have been at times food \nshortages even worse than those that resulted in famines under British \nrule. As Nobel-prize winning economist Amartya Sen has pointed out, this \nhas been due in no small part to India's parliamentary democracy and free \npress (admittedly a legacy of British rule, although British rule had to be \noverthrown in order for this legacy to be realized). In a democracy with a \nfree press, governments are afraid that they will be voted out of power if \nthey allow a famine to occur. Therefore, whenever there is a food shortage, \nthe government acts quickly to distribute the available food. This is why \nthere has never, in recorded history, been a famine under a democracy. All \nfamines have occurred under either colonial rule, absolute monarchy, a \nCommunist state or military dictatorship. In these systems, information \nabout food shortages is blocked due to ideology or the fear of subordinates \nhave of being retaliated against for upsetting or embarrassing their \nsuperiors. \n\nThings haven't gone perfectly since the end of the Raj, but India's \nindependence in 1947 was one of the best things that has ever happened to \nthat country.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13asno5ftz3fvjse22eezg4ipfoyfy5o04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCVUN6lucz9JdkPJNkTeGfQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 3.225806451612903, "authorDisplayName": "rawdogg", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-01T09:01:40.785Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCVUN6lucz9JdkPJNkTeGfQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99472201000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-06-01T09:01:40.785Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116840587064576688307", "textDisplay": "i love being a ignorant bigot..so fuck all you bigot haters your all just \nignorant \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z125hnxyfyjsinkyq04ccrzpfkzoizeoa0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtf16IZcwkK2AwxaE2HLgnQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MrParitoshJ", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-04T06:08:58.871Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCtf16IZcwkK2AwxaE2HLgnQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.55879799999999991, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-07-04T06:08:58.871Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111423285753610651354", "textDisplay": "India won independence indirectly because of Adolf Hitler..........period.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zevqygtzid1r4k04citd5zlzzvtdzb54": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1wos5S7KEv1aEHunb0eEbA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kevin Richards", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-06T15:17:34.474Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1wos5S7KEv1aEHunb0eEbA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.28379799999999999, "formal_score": 14, "updatedAt": "2014-06-06T15:17:34.474Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117282822228484599978", "textDisplay": "stefan, The Indians did not welcome the British empire in.

That said, the Right (I include SM in this category) does take a little \ntoo much pleasure in attempting to knock the iconic heroes of the Left from \ntheir pedestals. Again, not that I have a problem with it as long as \nthey're willing to look at the statuary in their own front lawns with equal \nscrutiny. They're not.\n\nOf course the real agenda in the criticism here is not the larger issue of \nthe perils of hero worship or even simply to provide necessary facts about \nan iconic figure that needs more scrutiny, but rather the attempt to employ \nthe method of guilt by association as a political tool. That is to say that \nsince Ghandi is a heroic figure mostly renowned by the Left (the Right \nnever particularly liked him even before all this nasty stuff about his \npersonal life came out) his flaws can thereby be associated with or \nattached to the Left. \n\nClaiming to be foremost a social scientist, and beyond Left or Right, \nMolyneux fails as an analyst, not in just what he says here but more \nimportantly what he doesn't say, what he deliberately leaves out of his \nanalysis (this was particularly true with his inept biased analysis of the \nTrayvon Martin case) which is the tactic of a propagandist, which I believe \nis what he is at core having suffered through too many of his lectures.\n\nMolyneux rightly brings to light all the evils and controversies of Ghandi. \nWhat he doesn't do, is talk about why, despite this, Ghandi remains \nimportant culturally. Iconoclasm is welcome in this case but Ghandi was not \njust the creep that SM depicts him to be and exists at the mythical realm \nwhether SM likes it or not. Unless you think that by exposing Ghandi's \nflaws his fame is thereby renounced. As an historian or social scientist \nworth a damn, SM needed to consider how Ghandi's flaws would, could or \nshould affect his legacy. Apparently he never had the inclination to do so, \nwhich means he's operating at the level of a propagandist.\n\nGhandi exists at the level of myth just as most of the famous, revered \ndead, but since his life is not so far in the past and we do have access to \nfacts about him that hitherto were unknown to most of us, it is important \nto get them out and talk about them. As our moral standards change, we \nrevisit our old heroes to see if they still pass mustard, most don't. And, \nI'll repeat, I think it's important to expose Ghandi and any other revered \nfigure for who they really were even if it doesn't jive with our mythology \nof them -- or especially so, but a myth, like a genie, is hard to put back \ninto the bottle once let out.\n\nPerhaps one of the most important slogans taken on by the Left, \nparaphrasing the bible, is \"the truth shall set you free.\" Whitewashing \nsomeone's past in order to make them a hero was always a bad idea. So let \nGhandi be Ghandi. Let educators tell the full truth about him. Richard \nAttenborough should have apologized for foisting his fiction of Ghandi on \nus. That said, no one is going to lose any sleep over the fact that Ghandi \nwas a deeply flawed human being. Mostly, Ghandi is India's problem. They \nhave to sort out what he means to them as time goes by. Many of us in the \nWest were/are inspired by his civil disobedience as a political tactic and \nlearning of his flaws doesn't change that part of his legacy. No one needs \nGhandi on a pedestal. Look at the ancient gods of the Greeks and other \ncultures, these were highly flawed beings. They have their positive and \nnegative features. One inspires, the other warns, they are both \neducational.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12vh3bqvqefvrjk1224yptawuabczuvv": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuM66CAeML1AzX83RnhbkgQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NMskMvE5bEM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABfI/l1Nwl9BrcV8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Michael Dunn", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2013-12-29T06:18:26.203Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuM66CAeML1AzX83RnhbkgQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.81356640000000002, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2013-12-29T06:18:26.203Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111095532702063825743", "textDisplay": "Comment.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13dunspklmvytamd235xfh4ex32h1zm0": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUQh39_gNAY4M2qXvIuVJw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bAB3gCvEw_8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/a64h32TfKhI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jim Jones", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-30T19:26:08.348Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnUQh39_gNAY4M2qXvIuVJw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.61757799999999996, "formal_score": 72, "updatedAt": "2014-04-30T19:26:08.348Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118007895434390879178", "textDisplay": "Everybody has their faults...Gandhi changed history with non-violence and \nlittle in the way of material belongings, yet he is criticized as a racist. \nStefan, on the other hand, espouses already established philosophical \ntheories that he labels his own, and begs for money from viewers, all the \nwhile criticizing and berating them if they don't donate enough.

Historically the \"Truth About\" series has focused on \npeople like Mandela & Gandhi, who are widely revered in popular culture but \nwith a disturbing moral record.  Similarly, Trayvon Martin had a \npseudo-criminal history but was portrayed as an innocent, cherubic child.\n\nStefan's criticisms of Rand seem to be twofold: she dismisses anarchism by \n\"beginning to philosophize midstream;\" in other words engaging in \nrationalism.  The other is an aesthetic argument - her temperament, \nsmoking, and choice of husband.  The affair could be grounds for moral \ncondemnation.  That's not enough to justify the need for such a video, \nespecially as the mainstream view of her is similar to the implication of \nyour post - this view aptly elucidated by Obama when he equated Objectivism \nto a teenage \"fad.\"\n\nFurther, Molyneux's arguments share much in common with objectivism - \nthough there are sharp divergences.  Indeed, Molyneux appears to have no \ncontention with Objectivist epistemology and metaphysics, which are \nprobably Rand's most important contributions and the foundation of the \nother branches of philosophy.  What does Molyneux share in common with the \nlikes of Mandela, Gandhi, and Martin?\n\nIt seems categorically incorrect to equate Rand with the other targets of \nMolyneux's moral critiques.

Certainly i haven't heard these things about Gandhi \nbefore because I never researched them. But how does him sleeping naked \nwith his young relatives that logically affect his views on nonviolence? \nThere are naked camping groups in the US where families sleep eat and camp \nout naked with their in-laws, legally, not \"immorally.\" If Stefan became a \nsex offender, how would that invalidate everything he says in his videos? \nIt does not. Similarly, sex scandals that the media focuses on in \npoliticians should not somehow taint their views on policy/govt. How does \nthat make any sense? I don't care if a politician cheated on his wife... I \ncare about what he says.\n\nThe monastic practice of celibacy in India has a long history that is \nshared by monks in Chia. Practicing celibacy takes extreme devotion and may \nlead to some of the oddities that were expressed in this video due to \nunreleased sexual energy, which may be a similar characteristic of many sex \nscandals in priests. Without sexual harmony, these things are more likely \nto happen. That doesn't make his views on nonviolence wrong... i do not \nunderstand how such a logical fallacy can be promoted in this video. \n\nSimilarly with racism against blacks, a shared cultural view on blacks has \nnothing to do with his views on nonviolence and does not make him a \nhypocrite. Racism is certainly unfortunate, but cultural views at a certain \ntime in history are not sufficient to show that someone preaching \nnonviolence is a hypocrite. Our founding fathers were racist and some had \nkids with their slaves, does that mean they were all horrible people? I'm \nsure idiots who miss the point will decide to think I'm racist, but the \nfact remains that most of this video focuses on issues that aim to \nINDIRECTLY show that Gandhi's views on nonviolence are at odds with \nhappenstances in the rest of his life. \n\nThe evidence presented in this video before 30 minutes regarding his views \non blacks being similar to animals, his adherence to a segregated unjust \ncaste system, his sleeping with naked young relatives, does not have \nanything to do with his views on nonviolence against the British. What we \ncan glean however is that he did not believe in fairness and nonviolence \nfor all human beings, but for Indians of a higher caste in India. It's \nextremely difficult to understand what cultural beliefs such as \ndiscriminating beliefs of the caste system say about a person. Perhaps one \nargument could be that no one in the past in a society with a caste system \nor a history of slavery was as good as people today where better education \nhas slowly eliminated slavery and racism....although that's extremely \narguable since racism certainly exists to this day. \n\nAround the 30-35 minute mark, the topics discussed are much more relevant \nin discussing how Gandhi's image as a nonviolent, peaceful man is \ninfluenced not only by his intrinsic views, but the passivism of the \nBritish. Still that stuff remains murky and it would be nice to read more \nabout this in detail than hearing the summary in a video. \n\nI don't know much about Gandhi's virtues so hopefully astute readers of \nthis post can see that the point of this post is to critically examine the \nqualitative evidence presented in this video rather than to make a case \nthat Gandhi was a great person. How do cultural beliefs carry over to \nbeliefs in philosophy and science and ethics? The case that beliefs in a \ncaste system or in racism against blacks, which exists to this day among \nmany Indians, certainly may call into question how ethical a human with \nthose beliefs can be and how well they can treat other human beings. But \nhaving those beliefs cannot invalidate Gandhi's view on nonviolence against \nonly one specific group of people. I don't think we can make the case that \nGandhi believed in equality and world peace, but that does not mean his \nviews on nonviolence were exemplary (if they were - this was not discussed \nin the slightest in the video). \n\nUnfortunate also is how social movements develop from forces that are not \nnecessarily well-intentioned. These institute's promoting Gandhi's views \nwhile failing to acknowledge his murderous past are indeed dishonest and \nignorant. But at least they promote nonviolence, even if they did it in an \nignorant way. Better than promoting something harmful off of a false \npretense. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaJe9wGoVsYwM7m_xfmzhCQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dopesauce42", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z124zbsxepefstmvt22mx1yypyntx1qrw04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2013-12-29T22:04:38.141Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaJe9wGoVsYwM7m_xfmzhCQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.424404, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2013-12-29T22:04:38.141Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-z3aFDev0Tbc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD4/ZmL5crUv-5E/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108345418737500814699", "textDisplay": "Nonviolence is immoral.

However, I feel in this video that I'm listening to an \nhistorian that is ideologically affiliated and a proponent of the British \noligarchs and their Jewish bankers. The British empire invaded much of the \nworld, all but 30 or so nations and their motives, my opinion only, are \njust as deeply depraved as any of the other nation states throughout \nhistory. Pragmatically during violent periods, it is often deciding between \ntwo evils on which side you participate and you often may say things in \ncontext that you may not really support. This video makes Gandhi out to be \na sociopathic devil when the nation states have tried to make him a deity. \nIt doesn't make sense to me in contrast to say Lincoln that we know, based \non many many sources has been erroneously placed into sainthood \nstatus, when he was actually an arrogant elitist tyrant. Perhaps it is the \nwestern education system for lawyers that is causing this problem, Lol. Our \nNation State surely wanted to cover up the exploits of Lincoln and the \nRepublicans in their successful quest to achieve greater central government \npower and control. I'm not saying you're incorrect with this assessment of \nGandhi, but I surely would like to better understand what you believe his \nmotives were. Lincoln was surely attached to popularity and prosperity and \ndid not have much respect or reliance on the masses, as his speeches show. \nHe was surely an elitist and racial separatist based on his own words and \nactions.  \n\nIf I were to have had sex while my father was passing away, I don't know if \nI would blame it on the sex. My father should have waited. Lol - A logical \nperson, which I believe Gandhi was, would have chalked that one up to mere \ncoincidence. Did his western education screw him up that bad?

link:\nhttp://www.academia.edu/326347/Changes_in_Mahatma_Gandhis_views_on_caste_and_intermarriage\n\nThe summation of that pdf and other articles is that Gandhi changed his \nattitude about caste, race, etc. from the tradition he was brought up into, \nto one of total equality of people long before he was killed, and every \nsource says that his military activities were those of Ambulance Driver, \nthough often there was no ambulance and he and others carried the wounded \nover long distances.\nFor those who are so opposed to all military activity that they will ignore \nsimple facts,  ambulance drivers, medics, etc are non-combatants who do not \ncarry weapons, even to defend themselves, and do not kill. Thus, the story \nof Gandhi happily shooting blacks for any reason is totally false.\nFurthermore, Gandhi did \"ambulance work\" and encouraged other Indians \nliving in South Africa to do it in order to show that they deserved equal \nrights as citizens (or in his case, foreign residents) in South Africa. By \nthe way, Gandhi was sent to South Africa as a lawyer for a business \nconsortium run by Indian Muslims, he considered all Indians in South Africa \nto be equal, regardless of supposed caste or religion, and he latter \nopposed the partition of India into Muslim and Hindu states for the way it \nwas handled.\nThat aside, anyone who knows the deeper history of India knows that it as \nthe British who created it by drawing its borders. Thus India as a nation \nwas a colonial invention in the first place.\nGandhi's marriage was arranged by his parents and the parents of the bride, \nas was the custom of the day. He had absolutely no choice in the matter.\nI do not challenge the stories of strange sexual \"beliefs\" or how he \ntreated his family, since I am no more anxious to paint him as a hero than \nanybody else.

I subscribed to his \nchannel some time ago and while I appreciated many videos I was put off by \nhis arrogant personality, but it seemed to work for him so i overlooked it. \nBut after running into several videos that purport to offer \"The Truth...\" \nin such an intellectually biased and distorted manner, I unsubscribed.\n\nI am okay with presenting controversial material and even going after \nthings for entertainment value to have a positive effect... see my video \n\"Wake up Call to Black People\" for example... but I don't see the value in \nretroactively assassinating the character of figures such as MLK or Ghandi \nas a positive way forward. These figures wouldn't even be on Stefan's or \nanyone's radar had they not been inspired and willing to pay with their \nlives for their cause.

If anything, maybe a little dose of \"hero worship\" could be \nhelpful to inspire people to take action and get off the bleachers of \n\"infotainment\".\n\nIts unfortunate to me that he doesn't place more value on the reality that \nwe can in fact make a real difference in this world, even as imperfect as \nwe are. Both Ghandi, MLK, and countless others are great examples of that. \nShow there flaws, but in light of their achievements and you'll be inspired \nby it - even if you don't agree with them on every point.

They should be \nbuilding roads, flood defences and work in chain gangs, wherever emergency \nrequires. There would be far less recidivism as the result.\n2) Your view of Putin versus Nemtsov is completely distorted. Nemtsov might \nhave been the leader of some thirtiary opposition during the Yeltsin era, \nbut he was of far lesser treath to Putin. He was probably assasinated by \nthe Ukrainian regime (or by CIA), to create some form of resentment amongst \nthe Russian Jews. Similar applies to comments about Berezovsky, yet another \nhas been.\n3) Charlie Hebdo and Muhammad depiction? I am lapsed, non practicing \nCatholic, yet I wouldn't like anyone poking fun, or insulting my religious \nviews, no matter how light heartedly it was meant. This was purely a \nprovocation and as in the law of physics, every action results in the \nreaction. Whilst I don't condone, or agree in any way, with what has \nhappened. I do understand why it did happen and why someone deeply \nreligious, might have been offended. \n4) The current situation in Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Syria etc.? Who had a \nvested interest in destabilising the entire Middle East? Who has armed ISIL \n\ufeffand pushed for the overhrow of Gaddafi, Mubarak and Asad? In who's \ninterest is it to arm Kurds, to aid the partition of Turkey, Iraq and Syria \nand to further the Islamisation of Turkey? \n\nI do really think that you have missed the plot in most instances. As well, \nyou seem to use the words \"democracy\" and \"democratic\" a lot. \"Democracy\" \nhas nothing to do with freedom(s) of individuals. After all, India is meant \nto be a democracy, yet it has the slavery, cast system etc.\nDemocracy is a form of government, where the Head of State is \"elected\" and \n\"both\" chambers of parliament are \"elected\", preferably on one man one vote \nbasis. You know the business of \"for the people and by the people\"? The \n\"constitution\" plays a major part in any Democracy. By definition, \nDemocracy is a Republic (as in France,, US etc). The United Kingdom with \nit's unelected House of Lords and no Constitution, is not even \nParliamentary Democracy, so what rights do we have to preach to others on \n\"civil rights, democratic elections, self determination\" and other issues. \nThe Middle East has it's divisions, of which Shia and Suni diferences play \nan important part.

The slavery and tribal conflicts existed in the \nWestern part of sub Saharan Africa at least 2000 years, prior to European \narrival in 1500 AD. The archaelogical evidence in places like Guinea, Mali \nand Ghana points to tribal warfare, canibalism and the impact of localised \ntropical diseases (lassa, dengue, yellow fever, malaria, ring worm, \nbilrhasia and many other). The results were published by Cornell University \nresearchers not that long ago. Team of archaelogists, genecists and \npsychologists from Universities of Regensburg and Rome, cooperated with \nCornel. Interestingly, their compatative study of y chromozome, has \nuncovered, the lack of presence of black bantu DNA in Central and Eastern \nAfrica 2000 years ago.

Hinduism doesn't promote the caste system. Caste \nsystem was a creation by the Hindu elite. The religious texts of Hinduism \nmainly Vedas and Upanishads have no mention of the caste system. The \nproblem is that Vedas were not written down and were spread orally (I \nknow!) and the caste system evolved over the past 4500 years in the Indian \nsociety. It's a creation of the Hindus not the Hindu philosophy itself. It \ndoesn't matter to me any way because I'm an Atheist and ironically Hinduism \nhas a school of thought supports Atheism (yes!) and I couldn't care less \nagain.\nAnyway regarding Gandhi himself, The word \"sleeping\" in the East just means \nsleeping. It is a common practice for elders (parents, grandparents) to \nsleep along with their younger children, grandchildren and relatives since \nthe dawn of civilization. This is the culture and has nothing to do with \nsex like it is perceived in the west. The letters that talk about all these \nsexual experiments are intertwined with the culture and it's extremely \ndifficult to put the blame on considering the time and religious intensity \nthat floated around back them. I'm not supporting Gandhi by any means but \nthere are things to learn from him (non-violence) and ideas of his to \nrefrain from (non-realistic & impractical principles). But the takeaway is \nthat he is human not god, just like the hundreds of our historic heroes. \nAnd  as far as I'm concerned, he did something that takes a lot of courage \nand self sacrifice by embracing and promoting non-violence (quite similar \nto the non-aggression principle of Libertarians) and I'm fully aware of his \nnot so shiny parts of his personality.

Practical reality; he made the \nearly mistake of attempting to fight racism in the context of racism.  Very \nfew people 'worship' genuinely 'good' or 'better' people, so why so \ncaustically critical, especially when you see the positive effects of \nnon-violent resistance methods, as were employed in India and were also \nadopted by ML King in the US.  \n\nThis 'truth'-expose is skewered and unfair on multiple levels, using false \nor unachievable absolute truisms and hyperbolic depictions of anecdotes to \nmake critical points in his moralistic philosophy universe, which really is \nlike a lala-land anyway, serving no real practical outcome.  I.e., you \njudge harshly, rendering everyone condemned in a vacant moralistic utopia \nof your own making.  \n\nNor do you  seem to understand or respect the operation of Ghandi's \nspiritual feelings and devotion toward Hinduism, a religion that is older \nthan most any.  For instance, Ghandi, like many Indians had a pre-arranged \nIndian marriage based on long established social and religious conventions. \n This institution was not really driven by lower sexual desires, as is \noften the case in the West.  The instance about Ghandi's father dying \noccurring soon after Ghandi's allowance for sexual relations with his wife \nreflected a belief that sexual acts somehow could dissipate a primal life \nenergy being otherwise suppressed and sublimated for more unselfish or \nhigher purposes.  This idea is important to Hinduism and just about all \ndeveloped spiritual disciplines, like Christianity, Buddhism, and Judaism, \nfor instance in the  form of vows of celibacy, and supported in their \nancient texts.  All this can be argued in convincing detail, but space is \nlimited here.  \n\nWish the video was a little more open-minded and charitable in it's \nrapacious endeavor to demean and belittle one of the first great leaders to \ndepart from the devilish mode of violence and hate in thousands of years.  \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z124dd5pqm3pjdex104chrup4vnpe35wnm40k":

The industries, converted to armament \nproduction during the war, needed rebuild and modernisation.\nIndia, even before the war, was a burden on resources and the manpower. It \nwas on the other side of world, it was too large to administer, too divided \nto police, the population was too poor and uneducated, to be much useful. \nBritish government was probably relieved, when India seeked independence. \nNo doubt there were individuals on both sides (British and Indians), who \nwanted to maintain status quo, but overall, most people knew it was the \nright thing to do, even without Gandhi on the scene.

Based on my own experiences in the present day hindu \nsociety which still has the lingering effects of the past, I would say \nwhile it was very limiting, the Hindus never practiced slavery in a \noutright manner. In fact, the caste system was mostly practiced for very \npractical reasons like hygiene, security, and to some extent socio-economic \nbenefits. People are really bothered about who they'll let in their house \nrather than exploiting others.\n\nWell what is said is said, so I'm not going really argue on this further \nand hurt sensibilities.\n\n2) British pacifism is not the reason they left India. Churchill took \nmeasures to ensure India would be weaker than Britain so they can retain \ncontrol after WWII, if India goes to revolt. Around WWII violent activism \nstarted and the British knew their luck is growing thin, Gandhi himself was \nunable to maintain a straight face before public and finally retorted \"DO \nOR DIE\".\n\n3) Another reason why British left is both USA and USSR are eyeing Colonial \nIndia. Stalin once remarked \"We should spread communism to South Asia, \nwhere people are downtrodden and exploited by colonialism\", I don't \nremember the exact wordings but that is the gist. There is a reason why \nIndia leaned towards Russia faster than it leaned towards US. British knew \nthat if they try to control anymore that would only become a perfect excuse \nfor people to resolve to communism. Because Churchill's policy, Bengal \nfamine and the overall state of economy ensured that people will no longer \nlisten to Pacifist BS of Gandhi. Both US and British feared spread of \ncommunism to Colonial India.\n\n4) Fear of Communism is also the reason why Nehru advocated Socialism, even \nthough he was a pseudo-Imperialist like Gandhi. The prevailing communist \nsentiment due to poverty and separation of India is why India quickly \nbecame a pathetic Socialist state and strong leaders got side lined. While \nsmaller and less important colonies/slave states like Malaysia, \nPhillippines, Singapore, Korea adopted Free-market more easily.\n\n5) Overall the quality of education, gross literacy and economic sense of \npeople is appalling at the time. Even today an average Indian has very poor \nunderstanding of Economy and Free market. While Indians hate taxes they \nalso hate Capitalism and Free market. I myself was a victim to this but \nthankfully I got some decent friends who introduced me to \"FREE TRADE\" \nideas. Overall it would be a very tedious endeavour to talk about free \nmarket to an Indian, even if that guy is a intellectual or \npseudo-intellectual to be precise. And I've seen these pseudo-intellectual \ntypes who seed younger generation with ideas about Communism and benefits \nof running a welfare state, in my work place.\n\nLike you I quit the regular 9-5 Software Engineering job as I was done with \nthese pseudo-intellectual morons.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13dt3nifyyrfbqdk22tshs5fzekivyfo": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9foW3hC8nsvIDIIQl_t4LQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QguVDTLG0Jg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/g8Ohb6znf9I/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "KamenJesse", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2013-12-28T19:38:10.934Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9foW3hC8nsvIDIIQl_t4LQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.15683000000000002, "formal_score": 25, "updatedAt": "2013-12-28T19:38:10.934Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102812256208602437430", "textDisplay": "You sure seem to know a lot of truths...\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5aIGD6_ywgXr_vhv9CFyGg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "mongavage", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13dt3nifyyrfbqdk22tshs5fzekivyfo", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2013-12-28T22:41:48.175Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5aIGD6_ywgXr_vhv9CFyGg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46490600000000004, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2013-12-28T22:41:48.175Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ce_1p9u439U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAK0/FqimJeUSeNE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103941951383342855627", "textDisplay": "Yeah I know, it's jarring... obviously our propaganda machines didn't work \non him.

Selfish to the core, he views the \nwarped philosophy of Ayn Rand as something positive, he's even quoting \nNathaniel now :) and anybody with a brain should be able to see through his \nsalesmanship by now. He now makes a living selling ideology to keep him \ncomfortable. Actually, he's no better than the people he critiques, but \nnever mind, because of his affinity to natural law and property rights, \nthis makes him the new darling of his uneducated followers. Oh, yes, and he \nadvocates non-violence. But in his utopian world view, a large power plant \nupstream isn't a problem as long as you own it. You don't have to drink the \nwater, as long as YOU own the property. And if people downstream don't like \nit, then they simply apply the non-violent principle  by moving out of the \narea. Sounds like a great plan to me. Also, private property owners may \nform purely 'defensive' militias, because the other property owners around \nthem might get pissed off.  Everything is strictly 'voluntary' , of course. \nEvidently, in Stefan's world, there no commons, and even the water, well at \nleast downstream portion of it, is private property.  If you don't like the \npolluted water you have the CHOICE of simply moving.  Fucking brilliant!  \nSo, essentially, Stefan holds the view, that private property - including \nthe private property of corporations - is perfectly fine. Now, Stefan, to \nbe fair, probably wouldn't pollute anybody else's water deliberately. Like \nmost people, he wants to have certain freedoms, while being responsible. \nBut what is missing from his naive point of view, is that people will band \ntogether eventually, they do not live in isolation. So, it follows that if \nenough of property owners come together, they will form what is now called \ncorporations. At which point, this ideology goes full circle, by becoming \nthe very thing he claims to abhor.\nTo deny social interactions within the human species is to deny reality, \nwhich is what Stefan does constantly. He advocates the type of \nself-reliance which is impossible in world with 7 billion inhabitants. It's \nas idiotic and short-sighted as any central planning. Humanity as a whole \nis a mixture of individual desires and beliefs, which includes \ncompetitiveness, and a desire for cooperation on many levels. Stefan's own \ndesires blind him to the fact, that no individual or small group can win \nwithout the cooperation of others. His plea for money is merely \nself-servant. We are all like this, to some degree. But to call this a \nvirtue, misses the mark entirely. And to call a self-interest something \nwhich serves the greater good, is simply foolish. Either Stefan has \nsucceeded in conning himself, or he's succeeding in conning others.  I for \none, believe that his entrepeneur stance is entirely self-serving. There is \nno risk whatsoever involved for him, because his wife makes a living as a \npsychologist. In other words, the Molyneux family has a fairly steady \nincome, outside of his website business.\nMolyneux risks nothing substantial. But others, do risk something, and have \nactually been imprisoned or gone to jail for their beliefs. It would be \nhypocritical for me to say, that I would risk jail myself, but at least, I \nadmit it...while Stefan does not. Besides, his position is pretty much \napproved of by the very same corporate elites he seeks to counter, so his \nopinions pose no threat whatsoever to the establishment. In contrast to \nthose, who actually do get arrested, like anyone who even mentions the word \n'socialism' , which he soooo abhors.  Anything even slightly left of \ncenter, the center being right-wing these days, is a total mystery to \nMolyneux.  The bias is almost comical, but perfectly in line with anti \nstatists, who never took the time to study why states came into being in \nthe first place.  Oh, well.

That accounts for the \n*massive* increase in expenditure and the \"unfunded liabilities\".\n\nUS defense expenditure is 20% of Govenrment expenditure and *falling*. \nDefense expenditure is increasing in absolute terms but is pretty low as a \nproportion of US GDP.  I'm surprised you propagate the false meme \n(originating from Cultural Marxist organizations in the US) that defense \nspending in the US is both unsustainable and the main reason for trouble in \nthe US economy. It is not - although we can always agree that defense \nspending may be wasteful  (depending on whether or not other countries are \nalso re-arming, like China etc).\n\nThe US economy is struggling because of several factors, such as:\n1) Overregulation - to set up a lemonade stand in California requires *29* \npermits and certifications. As a result, business flees California. \nSimilarly the EPA has gone past its mandate to preserve the environment and \nnow wages an insane bureaucratic war against industry (civil servants get \npaid by the coercive appropriate by government - they don't care how many \nindustries they crush through overzealous enforcement).\n\n2) Massive Government Growth:  Government grew large under GW Bush. The \nrate of growth has increased massively under Obama. Running the Government \nis expensive. Running Government programs and entitlements is even more \nexpensive - you could run four simultaneous global War on Terror for the \namount of money the US spends on entitlements.\n\n3) Crony capitalism: Barack Obama gets the Fed to print money to prop his \nmates in Wall Street up. Michelle Obama gets her college mate to build a \nnon-functional Obamacare website for $0.6 Billion (and climbing). Barack \nObama puts lots of taxpayer money into 'green' projects that keep failing \n(but the CEOs all get rewarded handsomely, while the taxpayer is shafted).\n\n4) Government interference in the economy: The Us Government *forced* banks \nto take on debtors that the banks considered bad risks. Hence the mortgage \nbubble (where the banks then moved to make what profit they could out of \nthe bad debtors they Government foisted on them). The Government doesn't \nknow the business of a bank better than a bank does, it should merely \nmonitor to ensure no monopolies arise, competition is preserved and the \nconsumer protected.  Similarly the US Government has demonstrated that it \nis completely retarded when it comes to understand the healthcare industry \n- it should stay out of directly participating in that sector of the \neconomy.  As Reagan said, \"The Government *is* the problem\".\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13iwb0gcq2jw5b1n22mzlhgvpuvvrel5": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO81F-8hpSOMJvfGXKMqjMg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "llcoolray3000", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-13T04:35:39.859Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCO81F-8hpSOMJvfGXKMqjMg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.8171598000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-01-13T04:35:39.859Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116431292428190323252", "textDisplay": "\"Not a great place to backpack if you are carbon-based.\" LULZ\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z130gzxigo3ddjvcs23hxrtjayyrjhitf": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj7Y0dh5pdjSGyjZVqVJlLw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dJ87T0devgw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANo/tXYZX5QT0ks/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Lamenter Captain", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-07T11:24:19.178Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCj7Y0dh5pdjSGyjZVqVJlLw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2014-01-07T11:24:19.178Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102534269689919084165", "textDisplay": ""}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12by50rqun5x3mdk222hngzzpylh3zar04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMImAx2fWNuGEsL1I7Dmy-w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q58bGMXO5uM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGA/36xnEQj3AVY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "jfn1103", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2013-12-29T02:42:23.807Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMImAx2fWNuGEsL1I7Dmy-w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29823, "formal_score": 28, "updatedAt": "2013-12-29T02:42:23.807Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115666059270786928039", "textDisplay": "Please allow ads on your channel so you can focus more on providing us \ncontent rather than asking for donations.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC3L8QaxqEGUiBC252GHy3w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Stefan Molyneux", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12by50rqun5x3mdk222hngzzpylh3zar04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2013-12-29T03:39:48.690Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCC3L8QaxqEGUiBC252GHy3w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8698283, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2013-12-29T03:39:48.690Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9ifro6l4eVI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAoY/dFmr6ZdIC74/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105416475244874554281", "textDisplay": "It's much more time efficient for everyone if I spend a minute or two \nasking sporadically, rather than asking everyone to waste 30 seconds on \nevery video, particularly those who have already donated"}}]}, "z13lzhbphnfjgv5v5224gnixizvaddum3": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE9lPNchtM-qfk36o2TJ2Hg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CI4UwoFC_es/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/cv_CHHzkX8E/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tim Caffery", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-03T19:10:35.502Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCE9lPNchtM-qfk36o2TJ2Hg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0076300000000000257, "formal_score": 9, "updatedAt": "2014-01-03T19:10:35.502Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102490066432820079365", "textDisplay": "Sorry to double tap.

I think \nin a large way it must come from a child's - and to perhaps a lesser extent \n- an adult's perceptions of other people as it matures, throughout life.\n\nPersonally, I'd find it impossible to argue that a personality is impacted; \nnone, barely or even only partially by external factors over genetics. In \nfact, I'd find it as difficult to do that than to argue that physical \nattributes are more affected by external environmental factors than by \ngenetics, generally of course.\n\nFrom all we know of conditioning, this would be extremely difficult and I \nadmire any student of debate or member of debate team who has attempted it, \ncertainly as far back as the larger part of the last century. Not to \nmention the blatantly obvious question of; why advertising is so lucrative?\n\nSo, to get to my point!\n\nSurely if it's conceded that a personality is formed from perceptions of \nothers, I'm sure Mr Molyneux would concede that 'role models' are doubtless \na *good* thing as well as of course a *bad* thing. But also, importantly an \n*unavoidable* thing.\n\nNow, unfortunately, while Molyneux does a plumb job decrying hero worship \nas over sentimental, illogical and de empowering; he runs the risk of \nimplying that any kind of adoration or even respect is seen as a little \n'backward'. There is of course a balance, like most things\n\n...indeed, I'd say; like everything!\n\nI see a great imbalance in the way people see themselves, the way they see \nothers and the way they relate to one another, and I personally think it \nrequires attention. But I think that the problem is that people are 'too' \nselfish not less selfish.\n\nI get the impression, though I may be wrong, that Mr Molyneux has gotten so \ndeep into Anarcho-Capitalism that he's lost sight of some of the pivotal \naspects of any reasonably functioning society. Prehistoric societies going \nback for many millennia have been identified as 'human' on the grounds of \nattributes like having veneration for elders, those with wisdom. But many \nof these were close knit very small communities so the elder or wiser \nperson was usually a relative. Not a two dimensional celebrity or even \nGandhi of course.\n\nI don't actually think Mr Molyneux is discounting role models, I merely \nthink that in his fervour to rightly attack 'hero worship' he could have \nchosen one of at least forty or so individuals who quite openly flaunt the \nadulation of their fans for simply looking/acting/ good/sexy/greedy/hateful \nand basically satanic.\n\nGandhi never flaunted any of his attributes, he merely - as a human with \nsimilar or different flaws to Mr Molyneux's or my own - promoted love, \ntolerance, steadfastness, moral integrity and the adoration of one thing \nabove all other things; God.\n\nThat he was imperfect comes as no surprise to my Mr Molyneux, but that you \nwould try to use his whole existence here on earth as an attempt to shine a \nlight on hero worship is laughable in the light of such persons as the; \nKardashian's, GaGa's, Madona's and Obama's of this sick and increasingly \nGodless world.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12rgpzrcwyaxt0uf23dgbsplpzojbxvd": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCLADcf9NAavDTWqVpVCGww", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_2eIjEydfKg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABg/10UOtesyQME/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "saintgauden", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-06T17:03:30.998Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCLADcf9NAavDTWqVpVCGww"}, "sentiment_score": -0.53728200000000004, "formal_score": 80, "updatedAt": "2014-01-06T17:03:30.998Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108597329466926458502", "textDisplay": "One of the more important discussions concerning human behavior.

Presumably the toxic ramifications of capitalism). \nThat should be obvious to anyone (except apparently to your subscribers who \nare also expected to pay for this useless tidbit) but the more important \nunstated implication here is that people who work on behalf of the public \nare expected to save your life single-handedly, and failing to do so \napparently makes them beneath your contempt. Classic, clueless Molyneux! \nThe point of public service in a representational democracy, is just that, \nto represent via institutional democracy, to serve the needs of others in \nconcert with others, by creating policy to address social concerns. So, \nthose of you who share Molyneux's knee-jerk rage toward government are not \ndoing so in an unbiased, unemotional, factual way, but rather, driven by \nyour own unresolved issues with authority, i.e., daddy, I would claim.\n\nMy take on Molyneux (and all libertarians) is that daddy was a bastard (or \nat least an emotionally unavailable authoritarian) and so there is a \nprofound ambivalence to daddy and by extension, authority. You can't trust \ngovernment to save you (that's the way SM begins his thesis here) in the \nsame way that you couldn't count on daddy to meet your needs. On the other \nhand, there is an awareness that proper authority is lacking in your life \nwhich is why libertarians prefer the authority so-called free trade (forget \nfor a moment it doesn't and can't exist) and not the authority of \ngovernment. Actually, I agree that government should not be an authority \nunto itself, that's totalitarianism, and not what we have theoretically. \nBut this fantasy that without government \"interfering\" in your life, you'll \ndo just fine surviving by your wits is sadly mistaken for most people. Of \ncourse no one survives on their wits alone, including the rich. In a \nlibertarian society, unless you're born wealthy, you wouldn't have access \nto the education that Molyneux and his clueless subscribers have benefited \nfrom because the libertarian hypocrites would have pulled up this \nparticular ladder behind them thereby forcing others to go without what \nthey themselves have greatly benefited from. \n\nSome people, especially young Ron Paul supporters, forget or never knew, \nthat without government protection, the wealthy and powerful made the lives \nof most people miserable: long work hours, little pay, health care only if \nyou were lucky, no real access to higher education, etc. Ignorant, \nintellectually lazy little bastards of organized labor were apparently \nnever told the reason you came from middle class homes is not due to the \nfree market alone, but due to your grandfathers fighting for rights that \nhave since been institutionalized, (mostly under FDR and LBJ. \nUnfortunately, many of these gains have been eroded in the last 40 years by \nreactionaries of the far right including libertarians). And, it's very easy \nto show correlations. How many societies with a large middle class are \nmixed economies (combining socialism and market concepts)? All of them. \nWhich have the highest standards of living for the most people and also \nboast the happiest citizens? Deny there is a correlation between democratic \nsocialism and social success? How many societies with deregulated free \nmarket capitalism have large middle classes? None. (Libertarians might \nargue that there is no free market to compare with. That's because free \nmarket is a myth. If it could exist, it would. So the best examples we have \nare societies with relatively little regulation on capitalism.) How did \nPinochet's Chile do economically after Friedman's Chicago boys finished \nwith it (read Iain MacSaorsa who wrote an illustrative article in Spunk \nonline magazine)? Or look at Argentina in the 90s. (Most of the countries \nin South America have Leftist governments now precisely because of the \nfailing of capitalism to work for all of society.) The common claims of \nsocialism failing in the USSR, China, Cuba, etc, are bogus. What failed in \nthese societies is not socialism, but totalitarianism. (I realize \nlibertarians are not good with nuance and assume that socialism leads \ninevitably to totalitarianism but there is no example of it. None of these \nsocieties began with democratic socialism and reverted to totalitarianism, \nthey all began as totalitarian regimes and failed at some significant level \nultimately due to lacking democratic institutions.)\n\nI'll have plenty to say on Molyneux's pathetic attempt to belittle Ghandi's \nlegacy by attacking his personal life in another post.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z133dh0hyonhe3pkm23ocleadtr3vjh0q": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtREqGRlHznt-kHpUwkZNVA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jack Sofalot", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-11T21:08:22.103Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCtREqGRlHznt-kHpUwkZNVA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.57122600000000001, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-03-11T21:08:22.103Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113818988945291364170", "textDisplay": "Homicidal Klingons on their period.

India had a lot of wealth before British came. \nBritish were not at all the 'Rulers' but were rather 'looters'. Population \nwas never a problem. It has always been the strength of a nation. Look at \ncountries with higher populations, rather more 'working' population. India \nand China together, nearly contributed to 50% of world GDP pre - colonial \nperiod, which dropped to mere 6-8% together post - colonial. When America \nbecame a nation, it took 150 years to become a trillion dollar economy \nwhile India took merely 50 years for same. In the last two decades, China's \neconomy nearly grew five - six times to become a $10,000,000,000,000 (10 \nTrillion) economy! This was because These had huge number of 'working \npopulation'. India has 65% population which is below the age of 35. So it \nhas 800 Million youth in the Country can you imagine!! 1600 Million working \nhands! Just think of it. I challenge you just like China, even India can \nsurpass US Economy if govt makes key labour reforms and Free flow of FDI, \nmakes business reforms, and India can become a manufacturing Hub. It can \n'supply' the young working people to the 'ageing world' (check the facts on \navg. age of ppl). So even during the colonial rule, Gandhi suppressed \nanything like 1857 revolt in which British were knocked off and Fleed to \nBritain. If these 400 million ppl would have United again they won't have \nbeen able to rule India. Gandhi acted as a British Agent in a way. Check \nthe facts. It was because of Hitler's destruction of UK economy and Subhash \nChandra Bose ' s Indian National Army which forced the British to leave \nIndia and not Gandhi. So make a research on Netaji. It was not Gandhis \n'Inner Soul' saying that Netaji would be alive, it was Fact that he Knew \nthat Babu could come back anytime to India & expose the misdeeds of \nNehru-Gandhi. It was Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel who actually joined all the \nlittle pricey states to make one big HUGE nation without actually Informing \nNehru and forcefully made the two princely states of Junagadh and Hyderabad \njoin with India,avoided them to go with Pakistan. Pakistan? It is a fake \ncountry. The reality is Jinnah and Nehru both wanted good share of power. \nNehru was in deep love with 'Edwina Mountbatten' make a research! Her own \ngrandchild exposed in an interview. There is a difference between \nHindu/Muslim religious representative and Politicians. The Hindu Priests, \nRSS, Muslim Imams were STRICTLY against the partition as it actually \nweakened the country. It weaken the trust among the two communities and in \nturn made their task easier and made people believe so called 'Patriots' of \nthe country Nehru - Gandhi. People were brainwashed right from childhood as \nhistory was distorted. Today people can actually 'review' and make a \nreality check of the facts they were taught about in their childhood. Even \nthe Hindu Priests and Muslim Imams say the one who the Hindus worship as \n'Shiva' or 'MahaDev' is the same that Muslims worship as 'Allah'. The ones \nwho did not wanted to worship the almighty in Idol worship, made their own \nway of worshipping the same god! Yes! God IS ONE! Politicians for power \ndivided people and the voice of priests and Imams were unheared, \npurposefully ignored. That's what Rulers like Mughol killing Thousands of \nnon Muslims and And Millions of Muslim /Sikh/Hindus killed in riots during \nthe British Partition of India. All this just for the gains of so called \nreligion based politicians where they did not actually give voice the the \ncapable people which had actually had the knowledge of their own religion. \nIt means any Hindu can go to any mosque and any Muslim can go to any Shiva \nTemple to pray. It is just worshipping the the god in different way. The \n'Sanatan Dharma' originated thousands of years ago before any religion came \nto existence stated that 'There may be many paths to god. It depends on \noneself to choose whatever to follow.' So there is no god superior to any \nother as we are worshipping the same god by different names and by \ndifferent paths...\ud83d\ude0a\nIt is a high for India,Pakistan to rejoin to one single nation. Partition \nwas not declared before of At the time of Independence, but actually two \ndays after! At the time of Independence India was a single huge country, \nbut this border was officially only drawn/declared after the independence, \nby the top leaders like Gandhi,Nehru 3 More Indians and British officers, \nfor their own political gains.\nFacts were distorted to ensure that the leadership was kept with most \ntrusted British - mined People.\nAfter a fierce wartime between both the countries, it is the time to \nactually review our history.\n\n*Although it is thoroughly researched but any CORRECTIONS are MOST WELCOMED."}}]}, "z13jjplykziycxrrz04cc5qj0x3xtzja0cw": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 4, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL8_fV2mysrwzRKgSemLgrA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ch_MqA8ZSBk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADM/AaVtKboPAi8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "brownshoeT2", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-04T12:40:17.033Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCL8_fV2mysrwzRKgSemLgrA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.42874400000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-01-04T12:40:17.033Z", "likeCount": 11, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102038600185768001253", "textDisplay": "This is my first time watching any of your videos...

Who is the person that does the presentation, his \nbackground, his possible motives. Is he under any pressure or does he \nexhibit compensatory behavior that may affect his judgments.\nAnd most of all: Does the presenter make a clean, factual and fair case or \ndoes he contaminate the facts (verbally or visually) with a personal agenda \nthat deviate from the verifiable facts. Does he try to impersonate and use \ntheatrical tricks to convey an alternative picture that does not conform \nwith facts.\n\nGuys, I understand you like SM. He is a likeable person with a professed \ngoal to reduce violence against children\u2026 and who can argue with that noble \ngoal.\nIf you like him you should support him by donating or giving feedback or \nboth but not merely by backslapping. Feedback is our only means of helping \nSM to increase the quality of his show.\n\nThere is so much more to say about this\u2026 but this answer is already to long.\nHappy New Years to both of you."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvzEitihku7kqoPcF4kKkyg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Michael Price", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ftdcgjzr2etzhn04cclqzrzextpwoirc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2013-12-31T08:32:39.738Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvzEitihku7kqoPcF4kKkyg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.64433999999999991, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2013-12-31T08:32:39.738Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110052846499317783376", "textDisplay": "+Math Lind \"This is good for SM in the short run, but is it true?\"\nWas he wrong about anything?\n\nGandhi's motives were plainly stated many times.

I hear this type of \nbullshit argument from the Right often: how the great West has delivered \nthe savages from their dark age for their own good, albeit by conquering \nthem and destroying their ignorant cultures. It's simply a reflection of \ntheir own ignorance and reveals a long way to go in the evolution of their \nown morality.\n\nYes, India had and still has a caste system. It's terrible. Were the \nBritish with their similar class system expected to enlighten the Indians \nby example? The violent, ignorant ways practiced in much of India at the \ntime were appalling and the British certainly had some moral advantages, \nbut not many, not really. Anyway, they were not there to set a moral \nexample but to plunder. Same with the US. You can look at the US going into \nIraq or Afghanistan similarly. It can be argued that the US is more \nenlightened in terms of gender relations and government structure but to \nuse our so-called enlightenment as a rationale for causing the suffering \nand killing of thousands is an absurd moral position. The same goes with \nthe British in India. Had either of us gone into the places and forced \ndemocracy on them for their own good, that would be wrong but at least it \nwould be a worthwhile legacy. We didn't. We went in for our own immoral \ninterests, to plunder. So, all of Sm's apologist attitude for the British \nin India is total horse shit and should be embarrassing for any \n\"enlightened\" thinker to propose. \n\nI mean, it can be argued that some Blacks are better off now than they \nwould be had they remained in Africa. So what! Absurd argument. This is a \ncommon tactic of Molyneux's, he does this when talking about economic \nsystems, too. Sure, many people's lives in the US are better now (if your \ncriterion for better is more material wealth) with our market economy than \nthey would be 100 years ago. Again, so what!

Guys like Bill Gates ond Steve Jobs didn't \ndo well either and didn't progress past first semester at Uni. I sort of \ngathered that, that is why I mentioned the on line software application \ncourses and MSCE course. Still, being good at High School maths is a \nsuccess. In most of Europe, the education is free. Primary, secondary, High \nSchool and University. England is slightly different. You get free \neducation in state schools and very expensive education in public (private) \nschools. Universities, you have to pay around US$14 thousand per year, but \nthe government gives you 100% (interest free) loan, which you need to pay \noff, but only when you start earning decent money. In general, you are \nbetter of studying in places like, Germany, Holland, Denmark etc., than \nstudying University degree in England. \nWhere in Africa have you lived? I worked and lived in 5 different Sub \nSaharan African countries, spent time in few more, and travelled on \nbusiness in few more still. And I stand by my statement that blacks are \ngenerally extremely lazy. Why do you think that Chinese copanies operating \nin Africa (Sudan, Angola, Zambia, RSA) \"are forced\" to bring in even the \nleast qualified labour from China. Why do you think, that British imported \nmillions of Chinese and Indians to their African colonies? And yes, you are \nright, some of the blame for poor performance of countries in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica lies with their corrupt governments. There are quite a few African \ncountries, that could easily be self sufficient in food production (like \nZimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique once were). There are couple of newspaper \nstories on the Internet ... about Zimbabwe farmers, after having their land \nconfiscated, some left for England, Australia, Argentina and some migrated \nto Congo and Zambia. The Zambian group, about 100 farming families, \nborrowed the money from International banks, leased the \"disused\" land in \nZambia, bought the far equpment and seeds ... and withing the 1st year of \noperation, they have produced 75% of Zabian corn (maze) production. The \nother 25% was produced by 150 \"thousand\" black Zambian farmers? You need to \nverify the figures from the Internet, it might have been 250 thousand black \nfarmers.\nAfrican Americans, tend to assume, that black Bantus look similar, hence \nthey have to be similar. For many American blacs, Africa is just one \ncountry, like US of A. They have dificulty to understand that Africa \nconsists of 47 countries and 150+ tribes, with 150+ languages plus dialects \netc. Half of African population never went to school, the other half, \nmanaged to finish the primary school only. Usually, only kids of tribal \nchiefs, businessmen and government officials, manage to attend high school \nand progress onto University. Aside of colour, black African Bantu, have \nnothing in common with poor African Americans living in Mississipi, or \nGorgia."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Melon Lord", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qhdrpjtvrsn5n2220cp4igsnsylelv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-20T15:52:02.743Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0058439999999999603, "formal_score": 68, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-20T15:52:02.743Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zVGNL5I1460/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/HZzYKVTF9dQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101047819211786499910", "textDisplay": "+S Sailor\nI think you completely missed the point of my comment, and I am hardly \ntaking you seriously about the notion that Africans are lazy, especially \nwhen I was there myself to see just how hard life is.

Like I said earlier, \nwhen you don't need to worry about the next hunt, you can become \nproductive. In the African states the wealth is not distributed fairly, as \nthe elite minority owns an unusually high proportion of the wealth of the \nstate that they stole from both the state's assets and foreign aide. The \nstealing of money means the money cannot be put to good use to pay back \nloans, which makes their currencies completely worthless. The money is \nbeing used to let the politicians live fancy lives rather than to improve \nfarms and set up factories, which is further harmed by how local businesses \ncannot compete with globalized corporations from the US, Europe, China, \nIndia, and Japan.\n\nWhy is life in Europe comfortable (don't argue with that statement, life in \nEurope and the US is comfortable compared to the average life in Africa)? \nUnless you are a farmer, you generally go to the market for your food. You \ndon't hunt for it. As it is food is very cheap due to modern technology. \nNow imagine if you or your family spent even less money for the same amount \nand quality of food. Technology can help; there need not be new laws (as my \nconcerns were on medicine and education, not food considering it is so \ncheap anyway), but if you can spend less money on food for several years, \neven 25% less, imagine how much money you would have saved for something \nlike, say, a college class, or a good investment, or a debt.\n\nIn respect to perspective of just how much labor you need to put in for \nfood in first world countries, food is, for all intents and purposes, free \nalready."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Melon Lord", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qhdrpjtvrsn5n2220cp4igsnsylelv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-20T15:40:12.715Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.44169199999999997, "formal_score": 82, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-20T15:40:12.715Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zVGNL5I1460/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/HZzYKVTF9dQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101047819211786499910", "textDisplay": "+S Sailor\nNow I see where you are getting at and am agreeing.

You have to grow the tree, wait for the fruit \nto ripen, climb up the tree to get your fruit and be prepared to kill the \nlow life, that wants to steal your fruit, when you get down. That is a \nnature. This crap about the equality, food for everyone, clean water etc. \nis going to result in third world population explosion. Since 1945, the \nworld population grew from 4.5 billion, to 7 billion. The countries like \nindia from 500 thousand to 1.3 billion. The sub-saharan Africa's population \ngrew 4x since 1945, despite of quite a few minor wars, genocides etc. At \nthis stage, Europeans produce surplus of food (nearly 2x as much as we \nneed). You might have heard of butter mountains and grain mountains. Yet, \nour trade partnerships with the world, \"force us to import\" grain from \nCanada, butter and lamb from New Zealand, beef from Argentina, corn and \npork from USA etc. The result being, that we can't sell all our produce at \nthe market price elsewhere. It would bring the price of commodities down. \nSo we either destroy the food, or dump it in sub Saharan Africa. Blacks \nobviously love it, they never liked to work for living, so it is great. \nWhite man feeding them for next to nothing. The problem with this \narrangement is two fold. With Europe's aging population, the surplus food \nproduction will gradually diminish and with the black African population \nrising growth, their demand for subsidised food will increase. As can be \nseen already, hundreds of thousands of Indians, Africans (in US, Mexicans, \nBrazilians, Cubans etc) .. are on the move to Europe. Adding t these \nnumbers are now migrants from conflict countries (conflicts instigated by \nJews and and executed by us). The Europe needs migrant labour of working \nage, to make up for shortfall of births. The issue arises, when the \nmajority of migrants are unwilling to contribute to social and state \nexpenses. Some end up working in parallel cash economy, some resort to \ncrime, but the important segment comes to Europe to sponge of the states of \nEU. Or as you personally promote \"demand \"their right\" to food, water, \nelectricity, schooling, medical care etc. \nA few paragraphs back, I have mentioned, that during our development, we \nhad to learn to pre-empty attacks on our territory? The unchecked \nmigration, is such an attack. I doubt it will take more than 3 years before \na major conflicts develop in South East Asia and Central Africa. \n.

It is far less well regarded, largely, because of \nmanufacturing sector migrating from Europe to Far East. The engineering \nclasses are half empty to start with and lot of students fail within first \n3 semesters of studies, because of multilayered information overload.

Unlike most other goods and services, medicine is a \n necessity. For electronics, nobody needs the latest tech. Apple and \nMicrosoft aren't playing on the needs of people. The government still uses \nWindows XP. With electronics not being a necessity, people can choose not \nto buy a product if they don't like the deal, which means the company is \nforced to provide a good deal.\n\nNot with medicine. The customer cannot refuse medical services unless he or \nshe can perform medicine or create medicine on their own, can find a third \nparty service (i.e friend, family, another country, illegal medicine, \netc.), or trust their own body. Unfortunately, medicine takes a lot of \nskill, so it is almost always the right decision to hire the services of a \nhospital, and this is where the doctors begin to have fun. Since the \ncustomer NEEDS medicine, the doctor has all the leverage.\n\nIt is much more difficult to effectively create competition in medicine. \nSome cities are safer, cleaner or have lower/healthier populations. Neither \nthe state nor a company can effectively fund another hospital if one \nalready exists, especially if you look at small towns. It is very difficult \nto predict the effective source of revenue while guaranteeing a reasonable \nprice. To have good prices for healthcare, the hospital needs to be making \nmoney. The government does pay hospitals lots of money, but besides \narchitecture and power the rest acts privately. Physician wages are not \nrestricted, staffing is not restricted (for example, Canada hires nearly a \ntenth of the number of patient clerks that American hospitals hire), and \nsince it is almost impossible to become a competitor in the medical field, \nthese hospitals have free reign. In Europe and Canada, a hospital cannot do \nsuch and such or this and that because the government has placed a heavy \nhand on the number of practices a hospital can do. As a con, admittedly, \npatients need to wait longer for treatment, however a plus that is commonly \nignored is that patients avoid many unnecessary procedures that would \notherwise cost a lot of money. This also contributes to the expenses of \nAmerican healthcare: you get this checkup or that surgery when your body \ndoesn't actually need it, or there is a cheaper method. Hospitals need to \nfund them, so they squeeze the patients. Not to mention that you don't get \nto see the entire bill (which is illegal).\n\nI would like to know what you mean by Canada being more free, when they are \nmore socialized than the United States. I acknowledge that socialism can go \nwrong; look at China. China also has some of the worst capitalism, not even \nthe US. You should see Chinese education, where bribery is not policed. In \nFrance, with that huge tax rate, the government is able to really police \nthe healthcare system to not demand unnecessary charges from patients, as \nwell as prepay a lot of the healthcare so that both the patient and the \ninsurance don't need to pay as much. Medical growth does not stifle that \nmuch when hospitals are controlled because medical research is done away \nfrom the hospitals, like engineering is done away from the factories. \nMedical research is also international (unless we consider a national \nsocialist society), which means a hospital in France doesn't need to \ninnovate because the French researchers work for a completely different \nindustry, and work with other researchers around the world. Someone else is \ninnovating for them, unlike where the entire software industry is based on \ninnovation (because customers want what is new, not what works, while in \nmedicine customers want what works).\n\nTo me, healthcare is like running water, and I don't pay a company to have \nwater run in my house."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Melon Lord", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qhdrpjtvrsn5n2220cp4igsnsylelv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-25T14:10:44.044Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.44121000000000005, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-25T14:10:44.044Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zVGNL5I1460/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/HZzYKVTF9dQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101047819211786499910", "textDisplay": "+susanne petre Well I did not say that America was the poster-child for \ncapitalism, I just said that \"the US has a lot fewer economic safety nets.\" \nI did not say that America had no misplaced or inefficient social programs \ncontributing to obscene costs, however medical expenditure is due to, \nessentially, monopolizing a \"need\" in the industry.

Canada also has a number more of social programs \nthan the US does, which can be discussed later.\n\nI am also going to avoid the Von Mises institute of libertarianism."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA", "inappropriate_score": 0.25488530161427359, "authorDisplayName": "Melon Lord", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qhdrpjtvrsn5n2220cp4igsnsylelv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-25T06:21:34.262Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.34816800000000003, "formal_score": 60, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-25T06:21:34.262Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zVGNL5I1460/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/HZzYKVTF9dQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101047819211786499910", "textDisplay": "+susanne petre Ok, I can't argue if one side believes that people want to \nbe wealthy and the other side believes that people want to be happy. My \nbias is that wealth does not equal happiness. Compared to Europe, the US \nhas a lot fewer economic safety nets; it is a much freer economy. However, \nmedicine is beyond expensive. Justify paying several dozen grand for a \nmedical examination. You can get roughly equally effective medicine in 2nd \nworld countries (ex. grandfather needed his collar-bone checked in India. \nX-Ray scan cost 18k Rupees for him, which is $290). One bad car accident \ncan leave a citizen bankrupt, and they can be a very hard working citizen, \nnot just a freeloader like how complete-capitalists like to think.\n\nIn France, you get taxed to the bone-marrow, but you also get much cheaper \nhealthcare.\n\nThen you have education costs. In my college, my student loans would have \namounted to 80 fucking grand. I am God damn lucky that my parents payed for \nit (and I will never forget it). Now what about the poor saps that make up \nsome 80% of the US citizen population who have to pay obscene student \nloans? Even affirmative action doesn't help the minority students that \nmuch, and of course the white and oriental students get the full brunt of \nthe student loans.\n\nFor complete capitalism to work, everybody needs to be ABLE to compete. I \nagree, not everyone is equal, which is why I don't condone communism. \nPeople should earn things, but the sad truth here is that not everybody is \nallowed to be competitive, and not everyone is allowed to be rewarded for \nhard work. Education in my opinion is a right, not a privilege, but that \naside, for people to remain competitive in the modern market, they need to \nbe educated. Even some of the lowest jobs today require a bit of college \neducation. What happens to capitalism when so many people are struggling to \npay off this loan or that loan, loans preventing them from being risk \ntakers. The super rich are the only ones who can get off the hook really \nquickly to start taking risks and start partaking in capitalism.\n\nNo political system is perfect, but some socialism is needed to displace \nthe unfairness in the ability to compete. Why should one car accident ruin \nyour future financially? Medical procedures aren't that expensive to \nperform, medicine isn't that expensive to make, and doctors can be payed \nwith a respectable professional salary while only charging the patient a \npaper-cut's worth of fees. Where does your money feel safer when you are \ninjured: in France? Or in the US?\n\nAlso, happiness and wealth do not coincide. I personally think problems \nexist if one feels that they need lots and lots of money to be happy. \nLiving in Singapore sounds terrible, and I don't spend a lot to keep myself \nhappy (maybe I am a simpleton).\n\nAs for Europe and America receding, they will. All nations fall eventually. \nIndia has very few social blankets, and it is a poverty-ridden wasteland, \nnot a paradise for the wealthy (well, it is, but why should the wealthy be \nthe only ones to live decently while the other 70% of the population live \nunder dirt?) China has plenty of social blankets (too many), but also does \nnot regulate big businesses, and does not police corruption. China's \neconomy is faltering.\n\nSorry for the long-ass comment."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Melon Lord", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qhdrpjtvrsn5n2220cp4igsnsylelv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-25T05:12:44.844Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaup2SEhHzkiqYV_8zCbchA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.42568399999999995, "formal_score": 97, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-25T05:12:44.844Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zVGNL5I1460/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/HZzYKVTF9dQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101047819211786499910", "textDisplay": "+susanne petre Singapore is a fascist state, and New Zealand is not one of \nthe heads of international capital...unlike Germany."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTH91YoCX0-zT-g1-1Th2hA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Henry Lu", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qhdrpjtvrsn5n2220cp4igsnsylelv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-25T02:02:50.410Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTH91YoCX0-zT-g1-1Th2hA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.50879399999999997, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-25T02:02:50.410Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111273265836304880489", "textDisplay": "+Rudolf Graspointner Which country has \"pure capitalism?\"  Please let me \nknow, I would love to move there."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrr2R3wAfZgKFIgQntqk9MA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "R Jensen", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qhdrpjtvrsn5n2220cp4igsnsylelv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-22T16:44:11.065Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrr2R3wAfZgKFIgQntqk9MA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.63055799999999995, "formal_score": 12, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-22T16:44:11.065Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103318404698185874129", "textDisplay": "+Tim The Minecrafter That is not what I said.

I must however object to a few \nthings you mentioned:\n1) The practice of burning widows, female infanticide or burying lepers: \nThese were not religious customs, but social customs / evils. The religions \nof erstwhile India do not prescribe these practices. Thus, it is necessary \nto differentiate between religious and social customs. 'Widow burning' as \nyou call it was first of all a voluntary act by wives whose husbands had \ndied and basically limited to wives of warriors and not practiced by all \nPunjabis or by Punjabis alone for that matter. Especially during the Muslim \nonslaught, many warriors' widows self-immolated themselves in order not to \nfall in the hands of the captors and end up as concubines or slaves.\n\n2) Female infanticide: It is a barbaric custom which can also be traced \nback to social factors due to which sons were favoured over daughters all \nover the world\n\n3) Burying lepers alive:  I have never heard of. Lepers sure were outcasts, \nbut certainly were not buried alive. I would love to have a source of that \ninformation\n\n4) Hindu religion being the only religion advocating slavery: The 'Hindu' \ncaste system, which by the way in not the fundamental core of the religion \nwas a system of separation of labour in the society. Thus, the warrior \nclass had the duty to protect the people, the priests the duty to educate, \nbusinessmen the duty to serve the economy and the lower casts the duty to \ntake care of the things necessary for the functioning of society which \nincluded not so pleasant things. Your profession determined your caste. It \nis no surprise that the people dealing with government, education and \nbusiness had a higher social status than the rest of the population, which \nhas been and still is the case all over the world.  It is not a surprise \nthat upper classes, as they do today, wanted to maintain the upper hand. It \nis also not a surprise that people in the upper class wanted their children \nto enjoy the same high status, which still is the case all over the world. \nThus, thus caste became hereditary, a social system which got integrated \ninto religious customs. Furthermore, such a system of division of labour is \nnot unique to Hinduism and also existed in parts of world which had never \nheard of Hinduism. Another evidence for the fact that caste system is a \nsocial system and not a religious one is that the converts to Christianity \nand Islam maintained/still maintain this division where especially the \nChristian priests were drawn chiefly from the upper caste (forced) \nconverts. So caste system is a social factor and not a principally \nreligious one and is far away from slavery\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12kxpdo5preef34j04cdr0qrnjhc52yzuc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 10, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTRE6doM6JhGlbzouZN6hLA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KEkAt3d7VBA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOo/E63b-u9pGgs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "[SUM] \u2022 V0WL", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-03T02:29:37.804Z", "videoId": "XG2bKiRu48Y", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTRE6doM6JhGlbzouZN6hLA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.21842, "formal_score": 9, "updatedAt": "2014-12-03T02:29:37.804Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102667819440567545255", "textDisplay": "Y'know Stef, I think history would look at you like Socrates, and you would \nhave a real shot at that, except for, everything you say about Gandhi - \nwill be said about YOU because of your stance on animals. & your whole \n\"moral agent\" logic?

Whilst there are advantages to some countries caught up in the \nrelative prosperity of colonial rule, there are inevitably disadvantages, \nand the principle of independence, of a sovereign nation ruled by its \npeople rather than by an occupying power, is sacred really. That's why \nindependence for India *was* an important pursuit, and why people like \nGandhi (hypercritical and racist as he may have been) became figureheads \nfor the movement. \n\nStefan seemed to focus a little too much on the positives of the British \nEmpire, without addressing the negatives.

Thus he initially \ndiscovered how much power Jews really have and decided to become their \nAGENT, which totally explains the rest of his life AND how he has been \npresented to us ever since. \nGandhi's \"civil disobedience\" did not \"topple British colonialism\u201d in \nIndia. WWII did not \"bankrupt\" England.  The \u201cJews\u201d have raised you on \nthese MYTHS with *their* mass media and *their* \u201ceducation\u201d apparatuses to \ncloud your mind to how the world really works, i.e. how THEY work it, and \nthus make you stupid. \nBritain won WW-I by the expedient of bringing the US into the war through a \ncompletely corrupt back room deal that involved promising Palestine to the \nJews (the Balfour Declaration). Before WW-II even began, however, they were \nrealizing their ghastly mistake, i.e. that the  Jews in Israel (as \nelsewhere) are CRIMINALLY INSANE, and that making good on Balfour would \nturn the entire Middle East into a geopolitical horror show for decades to \ncome. Sho nuff. So by 1939 they were clearly reneging. Serious Jewish \nreprisals against them did not begin in earnest until after the war, \nhowever, because for Jews WW-II / Hitler put everything else on ice. Once \nthat war was over, England was suddenly Enemy Number One, especially its \ncolonial policy, which was being maintained in Palestine hammer and tongs. \nThe answer? Rip England\u2019s economic guts out so that it had to close up shop \non the whole \u201csun never sets\u201d thing-- Canada, Australia, all of it--so \nthat\u2019s exactly what the Jew planet-billionaires proceeded to do. They \npunished England\u2019s betrayal of the Balfour promise by subjecting Mother \nEngland to a high-finance WAR that ended the British Empire. This is \nactually much bigger and more sinister than Irgun\u2019s and Stern\u2019s terrorist \ncampaigns against British troops in Palestine, and yet nobody knows it \nhappened. Why? Simple: because the Jews, who control what we \u201cknow,\u201d don\u2019t \nwant us to know it, so therefore we don\u2019t know it. \nWW-II \u201cbankrupted\u201d England?? There is not a single reason why we should \nbelieve this idiotic faerie story. England had been the richest country on \nearth for generations. If WW-II \u201cbankrupted\u201d it, then it should have done \nfar worse to the United States, which went into that war on its economic \ndeath-bed and yet right afterward went into 25 years of the most surreal \nprosperity the world has ever seen. The difference is accounted for \nentirely by asking this question: \u201cwhich country had done more for the Jews \n*LATELY* ?\u201d Shit, America had enabled them to get THE BOMB, fer crise sake. \nNo dummy, that\u2019s THEIR bomb, and everybody with enough brains to matter has \nknown it all along. That 25 years was America\u2019s pay-off for helping them to \nrealize their age-old dream (planetary Absolute Power). \nGandhi and the Indian independence movement just made perfect foils for \ndeflecting our attention away from all of the above, including Israel / \nPalestine, where the real action was. Also, Gandhi will be beatified \nforever by Jewish-controlled mass media because he was such a shrewd, \neffective agent of their interests, exactly like Martin Luther King, Jr. \nGandhi\u2019s usefulness to them goes back not later than the 1920s, when he \nemerged as India\u2019s leading communist. \nLike King, Gandhi was the exact opposite of the Jews\u2019 media presentation of \nhim. He was your treacherous machiavellian ENEMY. That is why you should \ncurse his name and piss on his grave rather than worship him.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCURUmLf3HVO5fYatMGp-xnQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tommy O Donovan", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12rgh3intvxtf5ak04ccji5iwqnjzoq3x40k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-15T17:12:16.112Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCURUmLf3HVO5fYatMGp-xnQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.45845200000000003, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-15T17:12:16.112Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-55jkZnfcnJs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABYw/mispcD3M0mA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109527753082853508144", "textDisplay": "excellent post.

In fact, where labor laws \nwere enforced prior to any sort of investment in multiplying the \nproductivity of workers through tools and such, people often starved to \ndeath while being prevented from working. Mises wrote on this in Human \nAction, describing the 'orient'(mostly southern asia during the early \n1900s) and he cited authors who used no unclear terms: people who were not \nallowed to work would in fact starve unless they had advanced their \nproductivity first."}}]}}}
