Their motivator to \nsucceed was the threat against slavery, which would decimate their economy \n(and it did afterwards). The motive was economic, not racial. They did not \nfight just so they could keep the blacks down, they fought so they could \nkeep themselves up.\n\nI am not an apologist, I am not historically ignorant.

Sensitive?\n\nBut regardless, slavery was the primary cause of the war, Lincoln was an \nabolitionist because they tried co-existence, but the south kept pushing \nretarded laws into the rest of the country.\n\nFor example, a slave owner could take his slaves into a so called free \nstate, and still keep them as slaves, despite the fact that slavery was \n illegal. It went so far as to extend to buying out of state slaves and \nimporting them in to keep as slaves was allowed, and slave hunters could \ncross state lines to nab former slaves and return them to slavery.\n\nYou want to talk about states rights being violated? How about the right to \nnot have slaves in your fucking state. Slave owners weren't all \"states \nrights\" when they were on the violating end, I see no reason why I should \nsympathize with them when they got their shit violated right back.\n\nAnd on to the main economy point, that's a side issue. The problem wasn't \nthe robustness of their economy, but the fact that they used slaves to get \nit. If that economy had been built any other way, or transitioned out of \nslavery, the civil war would not have happened. Slavery is the linchpin, \nthe main issue, that began the conflict, and the main sticking point \nthroughout it.\n\nI find extremely irritating how apologists like yourself try to paint the \nissue as everything but the south being filled with slaves. Is the truth \ntoo uncomfortable for you? Do you not want to admit that the confederates \nweren't heroes or patriots, but nothing more than dirty slaves trading \nsacks of shit? Does that hurt your feelings?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTVGflOcd-v8HzMdP8Zpw1Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Braden Gilleland", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13uxt4oruyixf1n3223jjhbtkbvdjvgu04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-11T01:59:09.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTVGflOcd-v8HzMdP8Zpw1Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.057979999999999976, "formal_score": 57, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-05-11T01:59:09.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-mQ3S4sWtXZI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAM0/UfZztxmpSIg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114525996548448174268", "textDisplay": "+darkmantlestudios Actually, no, that was an incredibly significant part of \nthe Civil War.

Now of course they were racist, \nand slavery was an undertone of the entire war, but at no point was it the \nmost important thing. Lincoln was not a staunch abolitionist; he was not a \nfan of blacks. When he signed the Emancipation Proclamation, it only \naffected the slaves in the south, it did nothing to free slaves held in the \nNorth. Also, Lincoln at many points in his life favored shipping Blacks off \nto the American African nations, Liberia and Sierra Lione. \n\nThe economy was central to the Civil War, Slavery just happened to be the \nbackbone of the southern economy, and thus why they so opposed an \n\"abolitionist\" like Lincoln.

Former southern democrats and the current GOP have always \npandered to this group of the electorate not because they're inherently \nracist but because those conservative values are generally espoused by \npeople who do not seek or want government intervention in their personal \nfailures. \n\nTo them, having such a system also allows their competitors an equal \nfooting at success whereas for them, there is already a privatized \ncommunity of support (grandfather, rich uncle, a bank, inheritance) where \nthey can reach out to if this occurs to them.  In their mind, if you get \nhungry and run out of money or lose your home, you should be allowed to \nfail and relinquish your chattel to someone who is more suitable to use it. \n\nBasically...f**k off and go die out somewhere.  This is one of the \ncornerstones of our American N.I.M.B.Y. mentality.  While this \nideology does transcend race/ethnicity, it is one of the primary modalities \nfor entrenched racism to fester.  So the parties who have had \nanti-egalitarian ideology have always found themselves inundated by \nracists, either closeted or exposed and rich and poor. \n\nWhat's ironic is that if you were to put these same people in situations \nwhere the tables were turned, either because of financial or environmental \nfactors, their Darwinian thinking will fly right out of the window. \n\nFor example, let's say a deeply conservative republican senator from \nMississippi was touring an Australian safari and by some luck of nature got \nlost and stripped of his personal belongings, he'd gladly accept any aid \nhe'd receive from anybody in order to survive (fend off wild creatures that \nlive by this form of Darwinism), be it in the form of money, water, food, \nhospitalization or a sponsored flight back to the US. \n\nWhile this is an extreme example, it just highlights the reality that, to \nthose individuals, that this ideology only applies to people other than \nthemselves who might take the reigns of the economy and society as a \nwhole, back from them.\n\nWhat this all really boils down to is that over time, the haves become \nfrustrated with the have-nots because as they gain a better edge from their \nalready exuberant advantage, the have-nots continue to seek out ways to \nequalize the system built to keep them in or around the level they are on \nthe pyramid. \n\nThe have-nots embrace egalitarianism because they feel it will give them a \nfairer chance at success as it did for those who came before them who took \nadvantage of such systems whereas the haves embrace \n\"Laissez-faire\" ideology which will permit them to maintain their advantage \nand manage their enclaves of success (CEO, Dr., Attorney, Judge, \nBillionaire) and remain the gatekeepers to the nation's upward mobility \npotentials.  This is not always the truth, but in their mind it is believed \nto be a facet of reality.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ffz1a5lm1xv4km23kwxojmtmizr2fr": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv-Pss6hAIviuPqj6qX5XZg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-q0qk--LZBFg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/SLGdDtPbabs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "DeviantDespot", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-10T21:00:07.878Z", "videoId": "aTvyXo5UD3Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCv-Pss6hAIviuPqj6qX5XZg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.30205400000000004, "formal_score": 34, "updatedAt": "2014-05-10T21:00:07.878Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101613079061635512971", "textDisplay": "They are different types of racists, but both racists.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13myfh4lleuchyab04cczdqnpyth5dwwp00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZBqikEdP9RQTbLDsEzEtEg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BNLCDbIVdqc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/_Ndm4Kp5I0U/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 2.4691358024691357, "authorDisplayName": "Subcomandante Marcos", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-11T00:29:35.008Z", "videoId": "aTvyXo5UD3Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZBqikEdP9RQTbLDsEzEtEg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9182998, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-05-11T00:29:35.008Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113133353391228941605", "textDisplay": "The reason they run stories on RACISM is because RASCISM is not dead. not \neven wounded.

Therefore, it is only logical that \nblack people are less intelligent than whites.  \n\nThe democratic party was the racist party over 100 years ago but there is \nsomething call time and change.  They parties have changed demographically \nand politically.  They do not share very much with their past history.  The \ndemocracts of the south that were very racist join the republican after LBJ \nsigned the civil rights bill.  Strom Thurmond became a republican for \nexample.\n\nYou are ignorant of your history and ignorant of your own logic.

First, this isn't a study. It's a survey. BIG \ndifference. It's not scientific. It's social. Second, you're right that \nRepublicans are obviously racist and anyone who isn't either a \nknuckledragging simp or willfully blind and incredibly insecure can see it. \nBut when you say that you get comments like the ones you see here. Now \ngranted it's just the idiots who have nothing better to do but bitch about \nhow they're the real victims but they're a very vocal minority and larger \nthan you might think. We can't just say \"Conservatives are far more racist \nthan liberals\" in this environment because the monied and powered interests \nrunning this country want us fighting one another so we're sufficiently \ndistracted from the real issue, which is their hijacking of our government, \nmedia, etc. The corporate media is never going to tell the truth about this \nand shame the CONservatives into the fringe where they belong. The Koch \nbrothers don't want that so the best we can do is do surveys and that kind \nof thing to pretend we're actually trying to find answers. What we \n(progressives/liberals) really want to do is expose people to the facts and \neducate as many people as possible so this isn't an issue in the future. \nI'm guessing you're in your 20s from your avatar. If so you're around my \nage. Our generation is a LOT better than the others and the kids younger \nthan us are better than us on this issue but even people in our age range \nget very stupid about this. We're close to the end of extreme white \nprivilege in this country so the White Male Victim Brigade, as I call them, \nis fighting as hard and loud as they can to keep the status quo what it is. \nJust go to ANY YouTube video about racism or especially sexism and just see \nhow many bigoted comments you see. Check out any video with \"feminism\" in \nthe title and just see the idiots spew their venom. It's sad and pathetic \nbut they're VERY angry. They can't stand that their place in society, which \nthey believe they deserve because they're used to it and now feel entitled, \nis changing. So it's not really realistic to think we're going to have an \nopen and honest dialogue. Not yet. We still have some work to do.\n\nI would suggest that if you have friends who are kind of racist or \nsomething to try to get through to them and be as tolerant and accepting as \nyou can so that others see it for themselves.

I want to tell you one more thing I know about the \nnegro.\n\nWhen I go, went, go to Las Vegas, North Las Vegas; and I would see these \nlittle government houses, and in front of that government house the door \nwas usually open and the older people and the kids\u2026. and there was always \nat least a half a dozen people sitting on the porch. They didn\u2019t have \nnothing to do.  They didn\u2019t have nothing for the kids to do. They didn\u2019t \nhave nothing for the young girls to do.\n\nAnd because they were basically on government subsidy \u2013 so now what do they \ndo? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, \nbecause they never, they never learned how to pick cotton.   And I\u2019ve often \nwondered are they were better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a \nfamily life and doing things? Or are they better off under government \nsubsidy?\n\nYou know they didn\u2019t get more freedom, uh they got less freedom \u2013 they got \nless family life, and their happiness you could see it in their faces they \nwere not happy sitting on that concrete sidewalk.   Down there they was \nprobably growing their turnips \u2013 so that\u2019s all government, that\u2019s not \nfreedom.\n\nNow, let me talk about the Spanish people. You know I understand that they \ncome over here against our constitution and cross our borders.

And because they don't strive to get off of this \nfinancial aid they are dependent on the government and due to this they \nwill vote in whom ever will increase investments in financial aid. They \nthen do this no matter what kind of economic crisis the country is in which \nI find ignorant and selfish.

The Dems \nhave their own bullshit they back, issues they need to deal with but \nbacking racist ideologies is not ,as a party, one of them.\n\nIt is like saying you're for black rights and have black friends but you \nare still a due paying member ,albeit not very active and not vocal, of the \nKKK but against a lot of what they stand for. Why even be a member?\n\nLook, I was raised in a Southern white and privileged family that dealt in \noil and was a military family (dad was a Brig Gen) I was grounded as a kid \nfor bringing a black friend home and not using the servants entryway. I got \ninto trouble once and my mom took me to the \"black part of town\" (in the \ncar with the driver who was an older African American gentlemen-which as I \ngot older I apologized to him profusely) and she pointed out that they had \nnice cars because they spent their money on them as we did not allow them \nto live in the Country Club or certain areas and that I would end up there \nif my behavior continued.\n\nShe called blacks \"Negras\" and I was raised to believe that mixed race \nkids, which my family and their friends called \"mulattos\" were often cursed \nwith genetic issues like bad hearing and vision,that they were inferior \ngenetically.

It is based off of controlling wealth and maintaining \nthose that are in power lifestyle. The thought of inferior race came about \nto serve an agenda throughout history to justify the attempted genocide of \nmany race. Too bad most of the history taught is that of the \u201cwhite race\u201d \nbeing the front runners of seeing someone inferior to them so that some may \npush an agenda. The History is so well know even the world\u2019s dictators are \npushing the history back \u201cin the face\u201d the countries that stand for freedom \nand equality. Rather it is political or religious; the history that is \ntaught does not favor the \u201cwhite race\u201d, definitely when it comes to race \nand equality. To justify and keep it religious some used the appearance of \npeople to tie them to the \"devil\u201d so they could feel as though they are \nright with God or maybe to win over their citizens to fund their wars in \norder to gather resources and territory. When some are crazy religious they \npick parts of the religion to justify the evil that is done or planned. If \npeople truly believed their religion they would have peace within their \nhearts (actually their brain would release a lot of euphoric endorphins) \nanger, jealousy, and hate would not be at the front of their decision \nmaking. But that can be accomplished even without religious beliefs. Also \nwith so many wars there may not be enough recorded history that equates to \nthe same amount of recorded history of the United States or European \ncountries when it comes to the issue of race. I may be wrong about the \nhistory because I am not a scholar of history. There is one thing you \ncannot deny; that most Americans only know that of American history, which \ncontain so many lies that you really cannot call it history. It is more \nlike a fairy tale. Being very observant and analyzing constantly is a \nstrength but also a weakness that I have. Will the \u201chuman race\u201d really make \nit to a future that would advance them enough to the point that there \naren't issues based off race? Let me be blunt; it is the tech that creates \nfree energy, advanced food production, and advanced resource recycling that \nwould resolve so many issues. It may not completely resolve war though I \nwish it could; more like I dream that it could. If I were to pursue those \nthings how many would be against me and how many would protect me from \nthose that would not allow it? Because when change is brought through tech \nthat you control and can take away control from that which have had it for \nso long you will go missing and they still your tech.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13tdfeglpfnivhvh23yvfnyqkmbtl5qd04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYXGF_UkjkgZ-5sLddtrB_Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-42Cm34VfBjA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFk/3IeK_v8KVNY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 2.4242424242424243, "authorDisplayName": "HypnoticSuggestion", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-11T16:26:53.540Z", "videoId": "aTvyXo5UD3Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYXGF_UkjkgZ-5sLddtrB_Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.85581220000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-05-11T16:26:53.540Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105711112767167870826", "textDisplay": "Guy on the left, forget his name.

But also, we \nhave another way of understanding evolving social trends and better grasp \nwhy certain policies and views perpetuate. You can look at the rhetoric \nused by Reagan, which is still in the popular narrative, that there are a \nbunch of women popping out babies, stealing from veterans etc. etc., and \njust living off hard working white people, and the rhetoric trickled down \nto mean black women on welfare.

Let them decide how \nlittle they can pay people.\"\n\nHow does my argument give companies all the power? No one forces people to \nwork. No one has a gun pointed at their head forcing them to work at \nWalmart. Furthermore it is THEIR business. Do I have the right to force you \nto sell your most prized possession for a certain price that you have no \nsay in choosing? No. And I've already established that MOST people on \nminimum wage aren't poor or the primary earner in a household as well as \nthat increasing the minimum wage will increase those statistics.\n\n\"Lowering wages wouldn't create jobs.\"\n\nWhy don't people take my groceries to my car anymore? Why doesn't anyone \npump my gas anymore? Where are all the newspaper boys? I'll tell you where \nthose jobs went. They were destroyed by minimum wage jobs. Do you really \nthink that the market value of the lowest skilled jobs is or should be a \n\"living wage\"? That's ridiculous. Hundreds of thousands of jobs that would \nhave helped people learn skills or gain experience have been destroyed. You \nmeant to raise people out of poverty but you've destroyed the first five \nrungs of the ladder in the process, effectively making it near impossible \nfor low skill people to do so.\n\n\"If a store only needs 100 people to run it they're not going to hire more \nthan that.\"\n\nAnd if the minimum wage was abolished they would be able to fill many of \nthose positions with low skill workers, basically more of the poor, instead \nof 2nd/3rd/4th wage earners and teenagers that don't need the job to \nsurvive. Again you're harming the poorest of society in an attempt to help \nthem. It would be hilariously ironic if it wasn't so fucked up.\n\n\"Labor laws protect workers so we don't end up like the people in the \nBangladeshi factory where over 100 people died, because of the shitty work \nconditions.\"\n\nI have no problems with unions in and of themselves. Again you're creating \na strawman instead of attacking my actual argument.\n\n\"You'd get rid of the few things that protect people.\"\n\nAgain the minimum wage doesn't protect the poor. Even if they were the ones \nthat held most of the minimum wage jobs THEY WOULD STILL BE POOR. You can't \nfix such a complex problem just by saying \"HURRR DURR BUSINESSES HAVE TO \nPAY THIS MUCH\". Let's say for a second that the minimum wage was 22 dollars \nan hour and that the poor people were actually able to get those jobs. They \nwould be off the streets right? WRONG. They would STILL be poor because of \nINFLATION. None of what you advocate actually helps these people and THAT \nis my argument and you have yet to even contest anything I've said. You \neither ignore it or attack something I haven't said."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBuLHD_cB4piMhWJjmTnIJw", "inappropriate_score": 0.42918454935622319, "authorDisplayName": "Malcolm Marks", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12eiptiklncyptdz22uu5iohwzrsz51d", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-12T04:57:44.429Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBuLHD_cB4piMhWJjmTnIJw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.48462999999999995, "formal_score": 75, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-05-12T04:57:44.429Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116700201632781676503", "textDisplay": "You're argument is to give companies all the power.
