Under caution, when exiting a corner, you jump the \nthrottle some to point the car out straight. This is just a common thing in \nsprint cars because of the rear wheel stagger, as the stagger makes the car \nwant to continue to roll left. As well, this is a dirt track. Dirt is very \nunpredictable due to the way it can develop bumps and ruts and holes.\n\nAlso, sure Kevin Ward did the NASCAR thing of coming down the race track a \nbit and pointing, but you never, under any circumstances, get within 2-3 \nfeet of a moving car, whether it's a race car or not. If you watch NASCAR \nvideos of drivers getting upset at one another and pointing, they stay \nabout 10 feet away at all times, and are on brightly lit racetracks, most \nof the time in the middle of the day, wearing bright colored suits.

Third, drivers are supposed to remain in the car unless it's on \nfire. I can understand since they are burning alcohol that he got out \nbecause he may not be able to tell. But Ward is a complete dipshit for \nwalking back into oncoming traffic when they can't see to the right anyway. \nIf he had a grudge then he needs to deal with that shit off the track. Not \nwalk back into traffic. There is absolutely nobody to blame except Ward in \nthis case. Definitely deserves a Darwin award.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13dcxvqswqyc1uwj04civghlsnej3541cs": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu8xB676l7MUyx7sePht1fg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-iR5rY6Oloes/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADE/sxeWDjcb2qg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "SeaGamer4life", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-13T21:53:58.194Z", "videoId": "qILmIyG6qno", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCu8xB676l7MUyx7sePht1fg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.91816850000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-13T21:53:58.194Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117251200683572884461", "textDisplay": "I don't care who's fault it was, or for what reason.

The car is still on the bottom when Kevin Ward Jr hits the wall.\n- At 0:07, notice that Ward's car gets loose and hits the wall right rear \nfirst. Also notice that Ward was carrying too much speed, and had he slowed \ndown just a little, he would have been able to attempt a crossover \nbeginning at Turn Three.\n- Note the extensive damage to the right rear at 0:14\n- At 0:33, two things need to be observed: First, the #45 car almost hits \nWard, only just missing him. You will see him swerve to avoid him. Also, \nthe black suit and black helmet that he is wearing makes him close to \ninvisible for oncoming traffic. There is a reason you are instructed when \nyou are little to attach neon tape to your clothing or wear bright colors, \nand that is because darker colors are close to impossible to see at night, \nespecially with a dimly lit backstretch such as this racetrack has.\n- At 0:35, when Kevin Ward is hit, Tony Stewart's car steers to the right \nbecause he ran over Ward. At no time did he turn into him.\n- Ward was still wearing his helmet when he charged onto the track. What \nneeds to be found out is if the infield crew was instructing Ward to STAY \nIN HIS FUCKING CAR, and either he chose to ignore it or his helmet was \nimpairing his vision and hearing, and therefore made him oblivious to the \ndemands of the infield crew. These cars fly around like candy bar wrappers \nwhen they wreck, and you are to stay in your car if your car wrecks to the \ndegree that Ward's did.\n\nTony Stewart did not kill Kevin Ward.

He stands in the track and then abruptly skips a few steps forward \n(inward) as the 45 car passes close by.\n\n4. The 14 car, Mr. Stewart, now has a second to react to the presence of \nMr. Ward.\n\n5. Stewart collides with Ward, resulting in Wards death.\n\nNow, taking into account the accident happened on the outside of the \ncorner, all cars exiting that corner would be focused on the inside while \ndrifting.  Mr. Ward being on the 45 cars right hand side would also hide \nhim from view of the approaching cars momentarily and by the time Stewart \nwould have seen him a second for reaction time is an impossibility in a \nrace on dirt at that speed.

It's made me \nrealise that there's very little hope for humanity because the power of \npeoples' egos exceeds the power of their intelligence. I'm going to try and \nexplain as best as I can why you all should stop calling Stewart a \nmurderer...\n\nEmpathy is important here, because if you put yourself in Stewart's \nposition, you'll understand while calling him a murderer is ludicrous. And \nwhen I say put yourself in his position, I don't just mean behind the \nwheel; I mean know the backstory, know how to operate a sprint car, etc.\nFirst off, if it's so easy to swerve out of the way of a person, why do \npeople get hit by cars all the time? Hell, why do car accidents happen at \nall if they're so easy to avoid?\nTake into consideration that people get hit by accident who AREN'T walking \ninto traffic. Take into consideration that people get hit by accident by \ncars that AREN'T on dirt tracks.\nStewart claims he didn't even know Ward. Stewart's had longtime rivalries \nwith several drivers whom he DOES know. Jeff Gordon, Joey Logano, Jimmie \nJohnson, Kyle Busch. Why on Earth would he have so much pent up road rage \nfor someone he doesn't know as opposed to someone he has history having \nroad rage towards? There's no motive.\nPeople who claim he's a murderer need to take some psychology courses. It's \nridiculous to call him a murderer when a premeditated murder isn't a split \nsecond decision like what this video displays. Considering Ward broke \ndirect racing rules and etiquette by exiting his vehicle and walking into \ntraffic, seeing a person on a race course isn't something any driver is \nexpecting. Had Stewart planned to hit him, he would have had to think as \nfast as he had time to react, for which murder and recklessness really \nREALLY don't apply.\nIn addition to that, seeing a person on the race track wearing a helmet and \nthrough your own helmet, it's insane for anyone to assume Stewart even knew \nit was Ward, whom as I stated before, he didn't even know anyway. Why would \nStewart decide to hit a person on the track when it really could have been \nanybody just wandering out into traffic?\nSprint cars are also not normal cars. They don't operate like your Accord. \nIn order to properly empathise with Stewart behind the wheel of a sprint \ncar, it's important to acknowledge that you definitely wouldn't be able to \ndrive one yourself. They're designed to turn on dirt at high speeds. Anyone \nwho's seen the Pixar movie \"Cars\" should understand the effects of turning \non dirt at high speeds. Sprint cars turn by drifting. This is why the rear \ntire is what hit Ward. Stewart didn't turn into him, and he certainly \ndidn't go at him head-on. He was turning to avoid him in probably what \nlittle time he had to see him.\nStewart took several races off, and has avoided the press until very \nrecently. Someone who did something like hit another person with a car \nintentionally wouldn't avoid the public eye once they were \"caught \nred-handed.\" He obviously is very shaken up about the incident. And if \nyou've ever seen older interviews with Stewart, you'll know he's not easily \nsaddened, and far from shy.\nLastly, Ward could very well have been high. Take it with a grain of salt, \nbut still worth noting. Maybe he was sober during the race, maybe not. \nWe'll never know for sure.\n\nReally, I just want people to stop being so ignorant. If you don't like \nStewart, fine. Who cares? Lots of people have hated him for a really long \ntime. But just because you don't, you can't go calling him a murderer just \nbecause of what you think about him. You don't know him outside of what \nyou've read or seen on TV. Imagine if you accidentally killed someone and \neveryone started calling you a murderer for it. Give it a rest, folks.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z121thcz3l2vglied22ozthgdmvwdhfm3": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6s-r_fhmYjD1AVKYo3fNg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0CErlsler1E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQI/811kghHR41E/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ari Ehrenfeld", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-28T20:09:36.743Z", "videoId": "qILmIyG6qno", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCL6s-r_fhmYjD1AVKYo3fNg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.77132200000000006, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2015-01-28T20:09:36.743Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108384753006439404100", "textDisplay": "God why did he just come out of his car in a turn when other cars were \nrunning if he didnt came out he will be alive right now....\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ahzswmkr2ibmea22sjt3g5uqijf1hn04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_FYPB_S8Jw3cHRaLQY2Wjg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FhajzYuQc4U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAM4/Vcej-N8TPdk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Williamtipq", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-14T05:05:33.145Z", "videoId": "qILmIyG6qno", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_FYPB_S8Jw3cHRaLQY2Wjg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.21869999999999995, "formal_score": 23, "updatedAt": "2014-08-14T05:07:09.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117473109109768439265", "textDisplay": "Tony was trying to take a really sharp last second left, no one just slams \non the gas intending to make someone fly 50 feet because they're \ndisgruntled, you emotional crybabies need to stop lying and get real. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13mgvbwzy3dctswd04cetfj1yjoujli5hg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgGdq3tl1JYYSiw8jKewyNQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.68965517241379315, "authorDisplayName": "tam MYERS", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-12T15:55:07.755Z", "videoId": "qILmIyG6qno", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgGdq3tl1JYYSiw8jKewyNQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.40276000000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-12T15:55:07.755Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105260912113185385745", "textDisplay": "Look, when tony stepped on the gas, he was trying to drift out of the way. \nThose cars are really hard to drive, if Ward would have just stayed in his \nfucking car he would be okay.

Not marshals, not \nsafety workers under caution, & most of all not pit crew members on pit \nlane--just watch, it will happen that a pit crew member gets severly \ninjured &/or killed one of these days.  A vehicle going 45-55 is just as \nlethal as one going 180.  We've seen guys struck by cars just stopping in \nor just leaving their pit stalls, but they were only traveling several \nMPH.

Just watch the acceleration of \nTony's car as it goes by Kevin's. The evidence is obvious for any objective \nperson to see and hear. The wheel hop resulting from the acceleration is \nalso seen in slo mo and super slo mo. Starman, we actually both agree that \nthere was a force effecting Tony's car causing it to go right. However, the \nidea that the \"stoned on pot\" Kevin showed some superhuman strength and \ndexterity by grabbing the wing and holding on is delusional. I believe \nTony's big wing hooked Kevin's head,either under his helmet or through his \nvisor. I believe Kevin was lifted off his feet and thrown down the track. \nThat explains everything ; why Kevin just disappeared so swiftly, why he \nwas lifted and thrown down the track so suddenly, and the cause of Kevin's \nmassive blunt force trauma to the head. The safety workers kinda panic when \nthey see Kevin. His head is the only place they look at. How do these \ninjuries occur if Kevin grabs the wing and holds on? The big rear tire \nwould have flattened Kevin on the spot if he was run over by it. That big \nwing sticks out as far as the right rear tire and it is only waist high at \nits lowest. It is disappointing hearing you retreat to the DA and GJ. I \nbelieve they got it wrong. Not surprising if they are not aware of how a \nsprint car works. Wasn't that your earlier question? Kevin Ward made poor \nchoices that night and paid dearly. Tony Stewart also made poor choices.

When Kevin gets out of his car he walks around \nthe rear end to the passenger side. As soon as he is on the passenger side \nof his car, the first car that passes Kevin is the closest car to pass the \n13. It passes closer and faster than anyone else, which keeps Kevin high on \nthe track. As soon as that car passes by, a second car passes by. Then \nthere is a 2.5 second gap. That's when Kevin begins to walk towards the \ninfield. Kevin walks past the middle of the track. That's when the 45 car \npasses Kevin. Yo can see Kevin had to hop out of the way of the 45 car. You \ncan also see that the 45 car's trajectory is that he is coming from the \ncenter towards the inside to avoid making contact. In fact, you can see the \n45 car's wing \"wiggle\" when the driver straightens the wheel after making \nhis corrective maneuver to avoid Kevin. The 45 car's 2.5 second gap was big \nenough from the car in front of him to allow him more time to react to what \nKevin was doing. After the 45 goes by, Kevin steps even further towards the \ninside with his right leg. His feet are perpendicular with the traffic \ndirection. Stewart did not have as big of a gap in front of him that the 45 \ncar had in front of them. It was only about 1.2 seconds. Also Stewarts line \nwas only about a third of a car higher then where the 45 car was running \nbefore the 45 made his move to the inside to avoid Kevin. Also, the 45 car \nscreened Kevin from Stewarts view until the 45 was past him. I say this \nbecause they were in the middle of turn 2. Anyone that drives a car can \nvisualize how during a left turn, a car in front of you blocks the view of \nobjects that are on the right side until the car in front of you passes \nsaid object. That would give Stewart only 1.2 seconds to recognize, assess \nand react to what Kevin was doing. That is virtually the blink of an eye. \nStewart did the only thing he could do to avoid contact. He tried to kick \nthe rear of the car to the left by hitting the gas. He didn't have the \nluxury of 2.5 seconds that the 45 car had to avoid contact. \n\nAnother point I would like to make is about the mindset of Kevin Ward. Here \nis this kid that has been racing sprints for a quarter of his life. I'm \nsure he felt like there is nothing anyone could tell him about sprints that \nhe already didn't know. I'm sure he considered himself a veteran to the car \nclass that has worked his ass off every race for the past 5 years to \nestablish himself as someone that commands respect from the other drivers. \nSo it's not too difficult to understand how pissed off he got when this \n\"so-called\" professional driver that earns millions of dollars driving \nelsewhere, comes to his house and puts him into the wall. That is what \nfueled Kevin's emotions and made him decide that he was going to tolerate \nbeing wrecked. In Kevin's head, he was going to tell punk-ass Stewart that \nhe was in HIS house and make sure Stewart understood that very fact. Well, \nthat little temper tantrum was the reason for his demise. He put himself in \nharms way because he allowed his ego-fueled tirade to get the best of him. \nThe fact of the matter is that he would still be alive if he stayed in his \ncar. Simple as that. \n\nThe whole thing is really senseless. Stewart was just racing when they got \ntogether in the first place. You can tell that Stewart was setting himself \nup to try to make a pass on the car in front of him when they wrecked. The \ncar in front of him was running the inside line going around the turn. \nStewart went into the turn running the middle line so that he could \npossibly make a run on the outside of the car in front of him. Kevin tried \nto make a third line outside of Stewart. The track isn't big enough to run \na third outside line. He should have realized that he didn't have enough \ncar on Stewart to make Stewart yield the position. Impatience put himself \nin a bad spot in the first place and he ended up on the short end of the \nstick because of it. \n\nIn the end, I do feel sorry for Kevin and his family. I don't wish death on \nanyone.

The video doesn't support that and seems to show \nexactly the opposite.

Now I think this was done for several reasons. 1 he is a \nkid that you all miss and his parents don't need this kind of attention \nright now if it comes back bad. And lit could turn the tables on all the \npeople harassing Tony. \n\nFor people that know racing, especially sprints, know they are extremely \nfast. We are talking in the number of 900+horse power. So put a sprint on a \ndirt track with slick tires and what do you get. An car moving fast \ndrifting (sliding) around the track. \n\nSo let's ask some questions. Why did he give the car gas as he came around \nto Kevin. Let's put into play that Tony didn't see Kevin. But he did see \nthe car in front of him swerve to miss something on the track. So to turn \nthese cars on a dime you can't just turn the wheel. Doing so would make the \ncar slide or spin out. Same result. If you slam on the brakes. Same issue \nslide or spin out. Still an issue. So I need to get my sprint car to turn \nnow. I goose the gas and turn the wheel. Causes the rear end to come out a \nbit and turn the car. \n\nNow visually. How could of he not seen Kevin. Well let's talk visibility. \nIt's dark. It's dirt. Worse mostly all black, and he ran in front of Tony \nexpecting him to stop. You have a better chance getting a train to stop \nthen a sprint with slick tires on a slick track. \n\nI do know there is a great loss with his family and friends but let's cross \nall the T's and dot all the i's before sentencing someone to whatever. \n\nI will end this with one thing my parents taught me. Don't play in a busy \nstreet you could get hurt or killed I believe track rules disqualify a \nracer if they step out of the car. I also know there is a waiver that all \ndrivers sign your putting your life out there if you get hurt you can't \nhold anyone responsible but yourself or your team. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ketur1zmvcxj4r04cgzzz3wuagvcibzg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkBHrTUOBHxQvR9c1jIzD_g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LXy75v1NRDM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACU/YA2O8Rt8FSA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.2269938650306749, "authorDisplayName": "Egyptmania Thompson", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-20T15:50:55.836Z", "videoId": "qILmIyG6qno", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkBHrTUOBHxQvR9c1jIzD_g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.72012600000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-20T15:50:55.836Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109404937460755195995", "textDisplay": "@MidgetandDelta YOU need to shut the fuck up because YOU apparently don't \nunderstand.

That revving when Tony Stewart hit Kevin \nWard, Jr. was unnecessary and all other cars' motors that were running were \nnearly at idling speed. NO DOUBT the revving/gassing the throttle spun the \ntires quickly 'causing Tony Stewart's car to \"fish-tail\" to the right - \ncausing the right rear tire to roll-over Kevin Ward, Jr. and whipped him \naround and out from the fast-spinning tire. With Tony Stewart's extensive \nexperience racing many different circuits, he KNOWS HOW TO CONTROL HIS \nCARS, and neglected to avoid Mr. Ward.

At the maximum, this was \nmalicious intent, though hard to prove to a jury.

Also, the \nyellow/caution was out and that's why you saw the cars slowing down and not \n\"loud\" like they are when racing and \"throttled up\".

First off, it doesn't \nmatter if you go low or high into a corner, 99% of the time, the driver \nwill end up going high into the straight away, which is exactly what \nStewart was doing.  The kid should have seen that he didn't have the room \nto clear the corner and backed off the throttle.  Stewart has raced several \ntimes, both Nascar and Sprint racing and you see this stuff all the \ntime...cars that are in front always try to keep their lead on the person \nin front of them.  Secondly, Stewart doesn't swerve to the right to hit \nWard.  He is going pretty straight into the corner, but when his right back \nwheel catches Ward, it causes his front wheels to turn to the right.  \nAnyone ever had a rear flat tire go out when you are on the highway...same \nconcept.  Plus, I can tell you it's not very easy to see out of those \nvehicles.  I don't think Stewart knew the kid was out of his car, because \nhe was on the other side of the track when he got out.  I am not a fan of \nStewart, but he is a professional, and he would not put his ENTIRE career \nin jeopardy by attempting to scare a 20 year old on a Sprint track...use \nyour head people.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12yhtvjmoqscvhfq22kivvxjnruu32sw": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCup-l4gChKuwOi8mgedSrng", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pmBrSgLzxQk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABSM/ekhExhoX0Xc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.66225165562913912, "authorDisplayName": "Kadeem Perry", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-16T17:22:20.455Z", "videoId": "qILmIyG6qno", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCup-l4gChKuwOi8mgedSrng"}, "sentiment_score": -0.67955199999999993, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-16T17:22:20.455Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111961907608127601348", "textDisplay": "Honestly at 0:34 it looks like tony revved up, intentionally hit the kid \nwith his car (you can see the car turn into him), but then again, why would \ntony even have reason to do that?
