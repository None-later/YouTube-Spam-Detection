You should shun UTube documentaries, because, they urge you to think \noutside the box, which your dull-mindedness is unable to fathom. \n\nI don't subscribe to everything Ed C. is into, but I give him immense kudos \nfor thinking outside the box and having the BALLS to put forth his \nprepositions and theories. You've got nothing but scorn for things your \nmind is ill equipped to comprehend and your intellect too feeble to \nembrace. When you study at university graduate level, original thinking \ngoes a long ways and you'd never be admitted. To your meat and potatoes \nmind, you believe what you see, on CNN and MSN. If Wolf Blitzer says so, \nthen, you'd believe anything he tells you. If stretching your mind \nunderstanding sleight of hand deception and propaganda perception hurts, \nthen go back to amusing yourself on your crossword puzzles instead. Or, \njoin a discussion about the presidential debates and argue over which \ncandidate should be VOTED into the White House.\n\nPlease don't respond to my posts if you DON'T READ THEM because you are \notherwise a worthless nuisance to any discussion. You are the epitome of a \ntroll. If you don't care for the discussion, then, simply, BUZZ OFF, find \nsomewhere else to share your mediocre opinions. Lucille and Betty may very \nwell have been used by the Queen as her doubles. She'd pee herself with \nexcitement as she uses A-List celebrities as her playthings, she is that \nshallow, moronic, and, very NASTY. Deception is one of the great pleasures \nthose of great wealth and power pursue! They are simply bored with other \nstuff that would pique the interest of boors like you. And, they have all \nthe money, the media and the very nerve to get away with it. They contrive \ndeception in ways that are so outrageous, so stupid, or dreadful we'd \nshudder. Those who are the mighty and powerful worship Satan, and deception \nis very much part of their service to their master.\n\nThere is way more controversy displayed in U-TUBE which makes this stuff\nfairly tame and I'm sure you'd be interested to exhaust your resources \ninsulting all these theorists and their hard work. I may not be certain of \nEd C. theories, but I would stake my life on the theory that JFK was not \nassassinated on Nov.22.

Not a neat hole, a gaping hole \nwith a huge section of skin hanging loose. THAT bullet was NOT a Mannlicher \n6.5 bullet. It would be more likely caused by a 30-06 or a .223. A faster \nbullet that carried much more shock value.

The wounds in JFK's neck and Connally should have \nbeen a lot more traumatic. The evidence doesn't match up.\n\nOne thing that does match, and this video shows it well.

LBJ's long dead, 'Poppy Bush' is 'the undead' so not much help, his \nC.I.A. thugs are either dead or have been extensively promoted for their \nwork on the day and the Mob saw what happened to Jack Ruby and kept their \nmouths shut.\n\nEveryone pretty well knows what went on mate; they wanted to get rid of the \nidealistic Oswald with his 'Communistical' inclinations because he'd \noutlived his usefulness and was likely assessed as a liability. They stuck \nhim in the Book Depository on an unconnected pretext and when he twigged, \nhe ran. Seconds after the shooting and before he twigged, he was buying \ncoffee from a machine two floors down and completely unconcerned...and THEN \nwhen he heard Kennedy had been shot....well, he panicked and ran; surely \nyou can work it out, no?\n\nNone of this is new to you though is it? You know all this is true but you \nhave a job to do.\n\nSo the C.I.A. arranged for the car to slow and the protection to be \nnonexistent and then some C.I.A./Mob hit-men got him in a \ncrossfire...explaining the noise, the speed and accuracy of the shots and \nthe injuries.\n\nThere is no way on earth the exit energy could have countered and exceeded \nthe entrance energy. You'll be telling me you can mount a fan on a \nsail-boat to fill the sail or that you can prove 'zero-point energy' next. \nIt's idiocy mate. but if you can provide links to appropriate 'proof', I'll \nlook at it. Otherwise you're just spouting rubbish because in truth I've \nnever heard anyone official have the audacity to propose such lunacy \nalthough, again, they spouted some pure unadulterated shite on 9/11, so go \nfor it; let's see what you've got.\n\nEver heard of Occam's Razor?

Oswald shot three times. The \nfirst round over shot the car completely and hit the curb on the other side \nof the car. The second round entered his back just below the collar just \nright of the back bone and exited the front of his throat and entered the \nGovernors arm seated in the front and the third round hit JFK directly in \nthe back of his head center.

He \nwas the only shooter and the problem isn't who shot Kennedy but rather who \nhired Oswald to do it!

And your fascist government, the Bush administration forced the \nEPA to claim that the air was safe to breathe which resulted in many \nresponders dying and still dying. Your government illegally invaded a \nsovereign state like Iraq based on lies which is a war crime. Your \ngovernment has proclaimed a war on terrorism, and yet it hypocritically \nsupports and supplies al qaeda in Syria. Your government is also \nresponsible for murdering civilians with drone attacks. Your presidents are \nsworn to defend the constitution -- which you don't deserve -- and yet they \nhave destroyed it which is a valuable document that protects your civil \nliberties and freedom!

Governments always use the word \n\"democracy\" to placate the naive and ignorant into thinking that they are \nliving in a democrat state, yet they laugh at you while they destroy your \nconstitution and eviscerate your civil rights.

There was no civilian autopsy done \nin Dallas. The autopsy was done in Bethesda Military Hospital. It was \nCommander Humes who conducted the autopsy. He also burned his notes which \nwas probably the first time in history that a serious autopsy resulted in \nthe burning of the notes. In 1963 ( the year JFK was assassinated) LEGAL \njurisdiction  over the body resided entirely with the authorities in Texas. \nThere was no LAW on the books, no LEGAL jurisdiction for the \"kidnapping\" \nof the President's body. By LAW, it should have remained in Dallas for the \nautopsy. Not many people know that, but its true. The LAW was that local \nauthorities had clear jurisdiction for the autopsy- NOT the feds! During \nthat battle for the President's body which was apparently at gunpoint right \nin the middle of the hospital the secret service won & put the President's \nbody on the plane. Ironically, two of the agents who participated in that \nillegal seizure of the President's body at gunpoint were Roy Kellerman & \nBill Greer, who rode in JFK's limo & were paramount to his supposed \nsecurity. Since the murder of a president was not then a federal crime, the \nagents had zero jurisdiction. The law was changed AFTER the assassination, \nnow the murder of a federal official is a federal matter. But it wasn't in \n1963. So whatever else there is to be said about it, the fact of the matter \nis that they DID violate the law & they DID so very aggressively.

Even expert marksman couldn't fire off as many \nshots as Oswald, at a NON-MOVING target with the same weapon. And yet, \nwe're led to believe Oswald who's NOT an expert marksman not only can, but \nalso can do it at a target that's moving. Well I may of been born at night, \nbut it wasn't last night. But if the government says its so about Oswald, \nthan I guess its true, cos as we all know, the government would never lie \nto us, right? Here's why I don't believe my government.\n\n\nIts now been proved, they lied about their knowledge on the attack on Pearl \nHarbor that put us into World War 2.\nThey lied about Roswell. Was it a UFO or a weather balloon? Do they even \nknow yet?\nThey lied about the Gulf Of Tonkin incident that put us in Vietnam.\nThey lied about the JFK Assassination, cos like we BOTH established, anyone \nwho still believes Oswald acted alone is a complete & utter moron.\nThey lied about Watergate.\nThey lied about 9/11\nThey lied about WMDs in Iraq\nThey lied about the death of that soldier Pat Tillman.\nThey lied about the rescue of Jessica Lynch.\n\nShould I go on? In fact, that's about all they ever DO is lie. To me, their \nnothing but a bunch of Jackass's dressed in suites. But since government \nsays Oswald acted alone we'll just fly with that. When you lie to me, you \nlose any & all credibility you ever had. And based on the governments track \nrecord as you can see, they have lied plenty of times. And this is who the \nignorant morons choose to believe? Speaking just for myself, do NOT insult \nmy intelligence by lying. And that's what the government does, is lie. \nHere's another good example. Lets look at 9/11 for a minute. Now (and this \nis according to the government, not me.) On 9/11 they found the passport of \none of the \"terrorist\" that were in one of the planes that hit the WTC. How \nthe hell could that of even been possible? People keep those in their \npockets. And when everything was turned into a powdery substance, not only \ndid the passport survive it, it was recovered & yet no one can explain how \nit got out of the pocket of the \"terrorist\" & how like everything else that \nday, was NOT buried under all the rubble & that powdery substance. Amazing, \nisn't it? Here's a tip to the government. The beauty of the truth is, its \nthe only story you ever have to remember. The government should try it \nsometime. P.S. But I won't hold my breath."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLgWAcpkhSGWFND0kJxaJoQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Gregg Thacker", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134gt5rvljlszbtu22uexzgbrujzpa4i04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-14T16:00:44.316Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLgWAcpkhSGWFND0kJxaJoQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.90829020000000005, "formal_score": 12, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-14T16:00:44.316Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YOck5r9yJK0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/aZTCahg2c6E/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117080348494929333645", "textDisplay": "+defiantone I agree with you wholeheartedly !"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_r1M3kxQx6MAQIcep5hUmQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "defiantone", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134gt5rvljlszbtu22uexzgbrujzpa4i04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-14T15:04:52.028Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_r1M3kxQx6MAQIcep5hUmQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.27519999999999994, "formal_score": 16, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-14T15:04:52.028Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102655794695816731948", "textDisplay": "+Gregg Thacker Wouldn't surprise me none, coming from the government. \nBesides, anyone still dumb enough to believe that Oswald did what no one \never could, is beyond being educated."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLgWAcpkhSGWFND0kJxaJoQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Gregg Thacker", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134gt5rvljlszbtu22uexzgbrujzpa4i04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-14T14:57:00.506Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLgWAcpkhSGWFND0kJxaJoQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8724982, "formal_score": 19, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-14T14:57:00.506Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YOck5r9yJK0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/aZTCahg2c6E/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117080348494929333645", "textDisplay": "+defiantone the reason they broke Texas Law is that they DESPIRATELY had to \n\"cover up the \"SCREWJOB\" that they just made so they would not be found out \n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_r1M3kxQx6MAQIcep5hUmQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "defiantone", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134gt5rvljlszbtu22uexzgbrujzpa4i04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-03T07:03:32.634Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_r1M3kxQx6MAQIcep5hUmQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.57586800000000005, "formal_score": 33, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-04T18:34:02.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102655794695816731948", "textDisplay": "+lark1955 Yea but they still broke the law cos they didn't have \njurisdiction over Texas.

Sill, \nOK. The men removed Geronimo's head and a prized silver bridle which had \nbeen buried with him. Using acid and amid laughter, they stripped \nGeronimo's head of hair and flesh. They then took their \"trophies\" back to \nYale University and put them on display in the clubhouse of the secret \nfraternity \"Skull & Bones.\" \n\nThe \"Skull & Bones\" is a secret society founded at Yale in 1832. Its \nhistory is intertwined with that of the German Illuminati and the Nazi \nParty. They maintain a windowless building called \"The Tomb\" at 64 High \nStreet, New Haven, Connecticut. The club's assets are controlled by a front \ncompany, The Russell Trust Association, Inc. Every year, 15 Yale juniors \nare \"tapped\" for Skull & Bones membership. They are indoctrinated into the \ncultish society with elaborate rituals steeped in satanic theatricism and \nlatent homosexuality. The goal of this fraternity is to create the ultimate \nnetwork of \"good ol' boys\" around the world. Their alumni includes Prescott \nBush's son (George H. W.) and grandson (George W.) as well as heads of \nstate and leaders of numerous intelligence agencies, trading companies, \nbusiness empires and law firms. \n\nSeveral years ago, a Skull & Bones member anonymously \"leaked\" information \nregarding the society and \"The Tomb.\" This included documents and \nphotographs. One of the documents detailed Prescott Bush's graverobbing \nexploits. One of the photographs was of a skull and bridle on a shelf, next \nto a framed photograph of Geronimo. Other sources have since come forward \nand confirmed that Geronimo's skull is indeed on display in \"The Tomb\" and \nconsidered the \"mascot\" of this \"club\" on High Street. \n\nAlthough the Skull & Bones refuses to officially acknowledge their \nexistence, members have tacitly admitted to possessing Geronimo's head. In \nfact, Skull & Bones members (including Jonathon Bush, the President's \nbrother) met with Apache leaders in New York in 2000 and attempted to hand \nover a skull. It was obviously not the skull seen in the smuggled \nphotograph. When this apparent substitution was exposed, the \"Bonesmen\" \nchanged their story, saying the proxy skull was that of an Indian child. \n\nThe Skull & Bones then threatened legal action if the documents and photos \nfrom \"The Tomb\" weren't returned immediately. They apparently had second \nthoughts, after realizing authorities might ask questions about the \napparent abundance of Native skulls kept in New Haven. However, neither \nskull has been returned and that of Geronimo is apparently still the \nofficial mascot of the Yale club. \n\nWe the undersigned are horrified with this display of elitist, racist \nwitchcraft and ask Congress, with the assistance of whatever law \nenforcement necessary, to launch an immediate investigation into the theft \nand possession of human remains by the Skull & Bones society, the Russell \nTrust Association, Inc. and/or any members of the US Government involved, \npast or present.

OMG! You also claim I \n'dont know you'...actually...I do know quite a lot about you! I've learned \n(if I actually believed you) that you read some of the best books about the \nassassination and still think Oswald did it alone! forgive me for LMAO! \nThat tells me, you're as thick as brick or just plain stubborn. Hell, I'm \nconvinced that if you were standing right next to the shooter on the knoll, \nand handed him the kill bullet that he'd dropped, you'd still deny that he \nshot JFK! You'd probably claim it a coincidence...that he was just \ncoincidently shooting at pigeons and had nothing to do with the \nassassination!\n\nIt appears that you dont want it to be anything other than some lone nut \nnamed Oswald who, despite the difficulties of those shots from the TSBD, \nmanaged to effectively change your democratically-elected government in \n'63. No plot there! - Hell no! Kennedy's enemies (and they were legion) \nmust have danced with delight that some lone nut, unexpectedly got rid of \nJFK for them! What a happy coincidence that was for them, eh! Most of the \nworld, and most of America, believe there was a plot. I dont understand \npeople like you who deny the obvious; especially since you claim to have \nread some of the best evidence portrayed in books by those authors. \nHonestly, that makes me think you're either a liar about having reading \nthem, or you're just too damned stubborn (or stunned) to conclude the \nobvious. When you have to resort to 'magic bullets', or a Mauser \ntransmogrifying into a cheap Carcano, or denying piles of witness \ntestimony, et. al. to make this tragic and seminal event in US History the \nactions of a lone nut, then you're reaching for the conclusion you prefer, \nnot the one that more likely occurred.\n\nSpeaking to your comment: 'stick to debating the evidence'. Really? Have \nyou forgotten that, to start off this whole string of commentary, you were \ntalking about the relative positions of JFK and Connolly allowing for a \nmore normal path of that 'magic' bullet? The bullet's curious path alone \nwasn't all that made this bullet 'magic'; my point to you (that you did NOT \ndebate) mentioned the magic bullet's unbelievably-undeformed condition \nafter passing through 2 bodies, breaking Connolly's ribs and the thick part \nof his wrist. Remember that? NO...because you didn't answer my point in the \ndebate, so dont harangue me about not debating the evidence. The magic \nbullet aspect wasn't just that it hit both...it's was also how it emerged. \nHow astonishing!\n\nAnd furthermore, it's also 'magical' that this very bullet (CE 399), which \nALONE was able to link a bullet to the Carcano, wound up on a stretcher in \nthe Parkland hospital hallway which was not cordoned off! Yes...it was \nfound in a public space, NOT in the actual trauma room itself (what? \nanother amazing coincidence!? \u2013 imagine that!). And this was a public \nhallway where Jack Ruby was spotted by a journalist, Seth Kantor. Kantor \nactually knew Ruby, but, that can only mean by your standards, that Kantor \nlied, or was just mistaken, right? I can easily accept that this \nunblemished bullet was planted by the same man (Ruby) who ultimately \neliminated the patsy ...precisely so the rifling on such a magically \npristine bullet could tie the event to Oswald's rifle. No other bullet \nfragments from the assassination were sufficiently undeformed enough to do \nthat.\n\nSo yes, I tried to debate the evidence with you, but YOU sir, did not \nengage! No doubt you'll now exclaim that a bullet doing all that bone \ndamage could indeed have exited looking like it just came out of the box, \nbrand new! Right \u2013 I guess anything can happen, no matter how unlikely. Try \nto answer these issues that reach way beyond the issue of aligning JFK and \nConnolly. Good luck! No doubt you'll try \u2013 you'll reference some \n'authority' that claims, despite it's unlikeliness...that, nonetheless, \nit's possible. That's all you'll need: someone who still allows you to \ndesperately hold to your Lone Nut theory of history. \n\nChanging venues to conclude: What of the 'secret service' agent who showed \nSS credentials when a Dallas cop encountered him behind the knoll fence? \nThe Secret Service itself claimed none of their agents were on foot in \nDealey Plaza whatsoever! Boy, another curious anomaly eh! Go figure!

I believe it's \na genuine confession for a number of reasons: Hunt's wife perished \nmysteriously in a plane crash - she was carrying $10,000 in her purse. As I \nrecall from other readings, Hunt tried to get paid for his part and \nbadgered Nixon about that (even insinuated blackmail if memory serves). In \nany event, his deathbed confession sounds very authentic...like a true \nrecollection...AND he's telling this information not only to the video \ncamera, but also to his son, St. John Hunt. I believe Hunt had no reason, \napart from unburdening his soul wrt a heinous operation in which he was a \n'benchwarmer' as he tells it. If you have NOT seen this video search it on \nYouTube. I think you'll change your mind, Eliska. Here's to the Truth re \nJFK assassination winning out over the BS and evil behind 'The Big Event'. \nYou know, in conclusion, there sure is a lot of stuff that points steadily \nto the conspiracy angle. It makes sense. All political assassinations are \nnot due to lone nuts, however, they're often made to look that way. It's \nespecially important to remember all the powerful elites that JFK's actions \nmade serious enemies (like the hawks over his intention to withdraw from \nVietnam, bypassing the Fed Reserve Bank to print dollars based on the gold \nreserves, Big Steel's price increase which he reversed during a time of \nrestraint, eliminating or adjusting downwards Big Oil's depletion \nallowance, the Mafia and on and on). You have to be an ostrich to not \nconnect the dots re this matter...or someone who's simply too lazy to take \nthe time necessary to do their own thorough research (both pro and \ncon)...and yet, so many on this forum are too clueless and lazy to connect \nthose dots!
