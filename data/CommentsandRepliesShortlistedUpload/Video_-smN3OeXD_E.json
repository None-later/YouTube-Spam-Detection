Part of the charm and legendary \nstatus of Godzilla is its Japanese origin. Without that, it really isn't \nGodzilla -- period. At least the first movie should really be focused in \nJapan and yes, with lots and lots of Asian actors. \nI realize that it is difficult to listen to her arguments as she blames the \nTonight Show while ignoring the much larger problem of The Daily Show. And \nto hear her talk about Obama as if his election is a good thing is like \nnails on a chalkboard to most people, of course (don't hate -- look at the \npolls). She means it simply because he is part black, naturally, and the \nfact that he is a disaster is irrelevant to this way of thinking. And her \nfrequent approval of China's dictates toward American films reminds people \nof the other times that the liberals of Hollywood cooperated with strong \nsocialist parties like the Nazis. But, again, this is just how liberals \nthink and for reasons that I am unclear on, Grace has decided to turn this \nchannel into a sort of a \"diversity\" professor's look at the movies. She's \nvery talented and appears to really work hard to put out a good product, so \nIt's a bit of a puzzle why she wants it this way, but, hey, it is her show \n-- she can do what she wants.\nBut,

Just because Hawaiians are technically Asian, \ndoesn't mean they're linked to the Japanese culture Godzilla originated \nfrom. JAPANESE! Not just Asian. Whom by the way don't need you to defend \ntheir honor. From what I've seen from overall media, this movie is chalked \nfull of potential nostalgia and nods to the original films. Not to mention \nTHAT THE JAPANESE ORIGINS ARE EXPLAINED AND/OR IMPLIED BY EVEN THE TRAILER \nALONE unlike the examples you gave which supposedly had no reference. Which \nby the way ALL of your arguments were full of holes. Including the Johnny \nstorm bullshit. People were mad because they changed something that \neveryone was familiar with and shredded up years worth nostalgia and, not \nto mention, no one was asking for the change. Why didn't they make a brand \nnew black hero instead of reforming a character that fans have come to know \nand love. Also, Johnny storm was a re-occurring character with history. \nThese characters are newly introduced and therefore people care less. \nPeople tend to like things that are familiar. This isn't a racist thing. \nFor example I watched the justice league cartoon when I was young. My first \naccount with the green lantern was the black version. Even today, my \nfavorite version is the BLACK justice league version. And I'm a white guy. \nAnyway, I could go on forever completely picking your arguments apart but \nI'm literally getting a frustration headache. Just please, PLEASE stop \nreviewing this movie. Your enraging too many people, this can't be \nproductive. And also, try being a little less pretentious on a subject \n(Godzilla) that you know very little about. And yes commenters will tear \nyou apart. WELCOME TO THE INTERNET! This is what you signed up for. We're a \nbunch of animals get used to it.

Though I am still abundant \nwith excitement for this film, you do raise an interesting discussion. I \ncan see there are others in agreement with you despite some of the negative \nreplies it generated. \n\nHowever interesting point I'd like to bring up-once in a documentary by BBC \nfor godzilla made around 1998, there is a point where they talk about the \nAmerican film in 1998 and a former director of the franchise,Jun Fukuda, \nsaid how every nation could possibly have their own international Godzilla \nwith different takes on that story, Japanese godzilla, American godzilla, \nmaybe even a British Godzilla someday. (Interesting that this is billed as \nan American godzilla when a lot of British are involved behind the camera) \n\nToho exported the rights back in 1994 with guidelines, the jan deBont \nversion was canceled by Tristar but had a godzilla that was true to the \nspirit of the character. It however took place in America primarily. The \nfilm was never made due to budget, then the Roland Emmerich version was \nmade and he went forth and made a version that didn't even follow toho's \nguidelines but they were so far invested they couldn't back out. \n\nThis seems to have a little more cooperation from toho with legendary and \nseems to be meeting the guidelines with a timely message of Mother Nature \nstriking back due to man's ambitions, a prevalent theme in the early films. \nYes it's a shame that there couldn't be more international characters in \nthe leads despite the global scale this seems to be promoting, but I am \nwith the group that agrees that we want a well made film, and while you \nwere right in raising the issue and politics going on in the industry, a \nlot more action needs to be taken for any change to be made. Still, great \nfor sticking to your convictions and I'll still watch this movie and you \nand am interested in your final review when the film makes landfall. \n\nTake care :) \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z121vrzaimuoslq4r04citqjgwbairj5tgg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzSm3-dhAIiV_PLruSqlZw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SBXqQTi0z60/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAANnk/hT61MmQWMbc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kevin Sheppard", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T20:58:23.812Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKzSm3-dhAIiV_PLruSqlZw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.37946400000000002, "formal_score": 55, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T20:58:23.812Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106787400263448296050", "textDisplay": "Grace for president!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12rd3l4wtniejkz504ccrmxxryofxopys40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-rc-ywhMD6hLVyRjYRObuw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZAOfWPZYl94/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/ehM-M6Ko5Fg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheBatmanNerd", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T20:13:34.981Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-rc-ywhMD6hLVyRjYRObuw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.98464236999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T20:13:34.981Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108802509041511293707", "textDisplay": "I love you Grace, that is all.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z125fzwy3yqbd5z2r22jczm4pzi2jj5g504": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQgNi9r5b7OoEALAnv0uEbQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Wbv7yXW3wY4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADM/OpWBnPhi5y8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dennis Boyd", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T20:37:12.360Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQgNi9r5b7OoEALAnv0uEbQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.42449000000000003, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T20:37:12.360Z", "likeCount": 11, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104782901558820208784", "textDisplay": "I get where grace is coming from, it's like shooting a movie in Harlem and \nhaving the lead played by a white person while having one black as a Co \nstar surrounded by white people in Harlem. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNHaN1XabGg4orUEU3irRCw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Supreme Flange", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125fzwy3yqbd5z2r22jczm4pzi2jj5g504", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T01:34:38.111Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNHaN1XabGg4orUEU3irRCw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.079652000000000001, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T01:34:38.111Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9MUq4hF_kdQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEI/3dK5tmgBwa0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112370991192065886444", "textDisplay": "Who cares white people do the harlem shake?

Along with that, I understand \nthat films should have multiple races and Hollywood has come far in doing \nthis but why can a film not have predominantly white people. This is not \nracism it is just casting decisions that have nothing to do with racism. \nAlso another major problem I've seen in your Godzilla reviews is that you \nare judging a movie before you see it. I know you review trailers that's \nthe point of you channel and I love you videos but I don't like when you \njudge a film based on what you think it's going to be like. As much as I \nwant this to be a good film, I won't know until the day I see it. I'm not \nsaying it's going to be horrible or a masterpiece I'm open to what it's \ngoing to be. I think that is the biggest problem everyone who doesn't like \nyour Godzilla videos including myself. It's not that we \ndon't necessarily hate your views on the film but that you are prejudging \nand looking into something that doesn't really matter. It's 2014 who cares \nif a cast is mostly white. Does it really change the film. Sorry but I view \nit more racially insensitive to complain about to many white people in a \nmovie than to have a movie with a mostly white cast. Or at that point any \nrace. Who cares what the color of the actors are or nationality it doesn't \nchange the film. Finally, I'm white and wouldn't care if this film was all \nblack, Japanese  Mexican or anything I just want a good film and don't care \nabout the race of the actors.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101324036771148071549", "inappropriate_score": 0.17825311942959002, "authorDisplayName": "ssenajdag", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12yvnm4ml3usbtmh220elf4oqr4dxadd", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T06:20:04.249Z", "likeCount": 1, "sentiment_score": -0.7415560000000001, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T06:20:04.249Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101324036771148071549", "textDisplay": "Okay, I would like to point out that racism is still very common in \nHollywood. Hollywood thinks that non-white actors (especially Asians) are \nnot \"profitable\" enough, and that movies need whiteactors in order to make \nmoney.\n\nSo they often reject directors who want to make movies about non-white \nactors, because Hollywood assumes that their movies won't be successful.\n\nIt's like with Wong Fu Productions (popular YouTube Channel). They were \ngoing to make a movie in Hollywood, and they wanted their main characters \nto be Asian. But Hollywood told them that Asians arent profitable enough, \nand that movies need to be about white people in order to make money. They \nkept trying to persuade them to chose white actors instead, and when they \ndidn't, Hollywood cancelled their movie.\n\nOr like with Tokyo Drift. The director had to fight in order to have \ncolorblind auditions for his main character. He wanted to chose an Asian \nactor, but the studio was persistent on having a white actor. (and that's \nwhat they ended up having).\n\nOr with Mako, he wanted to make a TV show with an Asian protagonist, but \nHollywood executives told him that audiences would shut off the TV if they \nseen an Asian hero. So the rejected his pitch.\n\nI'm just saying. Actors should be chosen based on talent, but it's 100% \nlike that in Hollywood. Talented Asian actors are often turned down... this \ndoesn't mean Godzilla is racist for having a mostly white cast, it just \nmeans that Hollywood is a fucked up place which is very judgemental to \nactors who are \"minorities\" (like non-white people, women, LGBTQ+, disabled \npeople, etc)."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYpbnpfKCUbtwVJiKMy8Ulg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tebigong101", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12yvnm4ml3usbtmh220elf4oqr4dxadd", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T22:56:58.368Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYpbnpfKCUbtwVJiKMy8Ulg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.96231349999999993, "formal_score": 50, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T22:56:58.368Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AjLOWGGP8Qg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/R0M7AgDIe0I/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105694163796872291151", "textDisplay": "+Terrance Kelly Anytime!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCab9vyQWAlzlwiDv1KLw79g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "GodzillaFanForever 1", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12yvnm4ml3usbtmh220elf4oqr4dxadd", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T22:51:40.460Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCab9vyQWAlzlwiDv1KLw79g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.48965799999999998, "formal_score": 64, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T22:51:40.460Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/---82AeXKv4I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABB8/myuKFoIJDEI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116132774614098476742", "textDisplay": "I respect your opinions.

Yes, I agree that it's more than just a movie, it's \nan experience that shapes our perception of reality and normality.

I sincerely hope for the good of the human species \nthat this will change soon.\n However, here are my counterpoints: \"The west knows best- two white people \nin charge of Japanese facility\". It might be offensive to some- but here me \nout. Who created the atomic bomb? Who used it to win WWII? Who always had \nthe power to regulate the development of it's creative imperial power in \nthe form of scientific destruction? IT WAS THE WEST! The west built nuclear \npower. So, there are two Americans are running the show, and what happens? \nOne of them dies, the other is traumatized, and now, a Japanese scientist- \nyes stoic and maybe stereotypical- is coming in to FIX THE PROBLEM.\n Think of it this way: For so long, for 60 years, Godzilla has been in \nJapan, the nation that experienced nuclear attacks. Now, he's attacking the \ncountry that built the atom bomb, the United States. After all, the film is \nmore focused on man's arrogance towards nature. Who is more responsible for \nthat sin? The victims of the atomic bomb, or the creators? You can call \nthis casting objective racism all you want. I call it subjective national \nkarma. It's horror, and horror loves karma.\n The United States of America has one of the most powerful armed forces of \nall time. US army vs. King of the Monsters. That's a clash I've been \nwanting to see for a long time. So no, this movie's climax shouldn't be in \nJapan, and thankfully that's the case.\n One more thing, Gareth Edwards didn't pick Bryan Cranston for Breaking \nBad, he picked him for Malcom in the Middle. He said he played a good \nfather figure. If you don't call that risk-taking, I don't know what is.\n In conclusion- this Godzilla just may be much more authentic than you \nthink.\n    \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvQ1sEUH_6yzyaldoW20Aw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dylan Ward", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13bwp3pnnj4jfzpj04cij543vqqwbzrsd4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-13T20:40:39.306Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCvQ1sEUH_6yzyaldoW20Aw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.96972769999999997, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-05-13T20:40:39.306Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vs775gXI8os/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACc/VT-eboMOHBw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109207301158424719796", "textDisplay": "+Larry Flores I'll consider it."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvQ1sEUH_6yzyaldoW20Aw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dylan Ward", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13bwp3pnnj4jfzpj04cij543vqqwbzrsd4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-12T21:19:13.157Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCvQ1sEUH_6yzyaldoW20Aw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99997828200000005, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-05-12T21:19:13.157Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vs775gXI8os/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACc/VT-eboMOHBw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109207301158424719796", "textDisplay": "+Ginger Daikaiju You're welcome.

I have doubts that after over half \na century of relevance that this single American interpretation, which is \nsupported by Toho Studios, is enough to \"rob Godzilla of its cultural \nimportance.\" If the Roland Emmerich  version wasn't able to do so I really \ndon't think this version will.\n\nAlso, being an American interpretation, studios would seek out actors that \nAmerican audiences are more familiar with, hence the casting of actors like \nBryan Cranston. We do not know how big of a role Bryan Cranston will play \nin the film but they are pushing his image because he is the most popular \nactor in the movie.\n\nI don't think they are being disrespectful to the source material, they are \njust presenting their take on it. I wouldn't say that Turkish Rambo(1986) \nis robbing Rambo of its cultural importance because it only features \nTurkish actors and has no American actors. They are just presenting a \nTurkish interpretation of it.\n\nAlthough I do understand how you feel about the casting decisions, I think \nwe should also focus on other aspects of the movie besides the race of the \nactors.

Your argument is invalid, I'm sure \nwe will see plenty of Japanese people working at the plant as seen in the \ntrailer. We are only going to see maybe 20 minutes total footage in Japan, \nThe Hawaii scenes are centered around the monsters and U.S. military \n(predominantly white I might add) versus ensuring that the tourists on the \nbeach which would be the people on vacation are Japanese. Godzilla causes a \nTsunami and destroys Hawaii but you are worried that around 20% of the \npeople running from the beach are white, hmmm, This race thing you are \ngoing on about has no point when 90% of the movie isn't anywhere in Japan. \nI don't have a problem with more Japanese cast members but can you imagine \nhiring 80+% Japanese people in an American movie, you would receive just \nthe opposite reaction are looking for in terms of racial equality in movie \ncasting. I know this is a Toho license, a Japanese monster but America owns \nthe rights for this movie so it obviously will have a focus on an American \nfamily hence the trailers focusing on the Brody family versus having a side \nshow of a hundred Japanese actors. Having a single Japanese man in a \nsignificant role is a million times more impactful than jamming a hundred \nor even 20 Japanese people into significant roles in a predominantly \nAmerican movie. People won't say \"We should have more Japanese actors in \nmovies\" but rather ask \"Why are so many Japanese people in a movie based in \nAmerica?\" I would understand having a larger Japanese cast if TOHO was \nmaking the film but they are not. If you are implying racism in movies is \nstill a huge thing, fine but changing that is not going to happen quick. I \ndon't really know why I am bothering but i'd just leave this whole argument \nfor a separate video versus a trailer review which half of was spent \ntalking on this subject rather than the quality of acting, visuals, plot or \nreally anything concerning the actual trailer which included some \nmisleading info that you could do one search to correct and infer upon.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13mdp2iiumhctgjr04cfdah5wigzdy4e40": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMWDWZKyseaLOhOQUJw6ghw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jioCBVqvJsE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAE-g/HBMFsd5nNoc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 2.1276595744680851, "authorDisplayName": "Illuminati Swagnemite", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T22:41:45.842Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMWDWZKyseaLOhOQUJw6ghw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.60538599999999998, "formal_score": 21, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T22:41:45.842Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110289502294370936350", "textDisplay": "By the way, the \"spirited comment section\" (or however you fucking said it) \nwas technically started by YOU making that fail of a review!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13aft4journurjmq23iylkhtvikfvbn0": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgIM8fKNQMRW9ga-h_BYKrw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QXN-S_vRXfg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC8/M9u61IBVCns/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "R2 Productions", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T01:18:47.153Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgIM8fKNQMRW9ga-h_BYKrw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.27638399999999996, "formal_score": 8, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T01:18:47.153Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110221403044524551728", "textDisplay": "This does not look like another Roland Emmerich film, as you said.

That not to say it \ncan't be a good movie like the Departed which was a remake of Hong Kong's \nInternal Affairs. With Godzilla I really don't need an all Asian cast \nbecause the theme that Godzilla represent have become global. Godzilla was \nan great metaphor of how we as human being create a horror upon the world \nvia nuclear disaster. With recent natural  disaster around the world, I \nfeel that this godzilla can be a great story about how nature is going out \nof control and we all need to pull together to nature from kill us. So I do \nagree that it would be great to have non white characters play other major \nroles to combat this force of natural. One thing you didn't point out is \nhow much of a role the military is going to play in this movie where in \nreal life our armed forces in the USA are made up of a whole range races \nand ethnicity to combat something even greater then themselves. Now from \nwhat I've seen I still believe that most of this movie takes place in the \nUSA which really won't matter when such a catastrophic force of nature \nattacks since All nation pull together whenever an earthquake or tsunami \naffects a nation. So that is why I am ok with seeing the story not begin \nexclusive to japan anymore since the theme are so global. Other remakes \ndon't carry the global impact. But I do see now that there could have been \na lot more effort to have other races make up the extras and some of the \nmain cast.

If they, experts on Godzilla, are still eager to see \nthis movie, then it cannot be as far from the source material as you think.\nAs for \"The Raid\" american remake, I feel disappointed by the fact that \nHollywood cannot watch foreign films have success.

(or whatever)\nYou did not know that getting big stars for a risky movie like Godzilla \nwould be necessary since it's not the most popular franchise ever when it \ncomes to being dark and serious.\nYou did not know that with such a time like now, where we have cutting edge \nCG, with a 160$ million (Godzilla's budget) you will need big stars and not \nrandom Asians, so that helps your box office growth, specially for Godzilla \nsince as i said is a huge risk. (which seems to have paid off and everyone \nseems to like it)\nJapanese are my heroes, I love Japan, it's a dream to visit it once in my \nlife, just in case you think i hate Japanese. If Japanese made up Godzilla, \nwhen it's rebooted by Americans with a 160$ million budget, Asian \ncharacters won't matter since its a completely new origin story and a Asian \ncast saying the same words or doing the same thing wouldn't change anything.\nThank you for your time, and just so you know, I'm not a American thats \nshowing off about his country when i say it's American. I was speaking in \ngeneral. Why am I not showing off?  Because I'm Arab. Syrian, to be \nspecific, living in the United Arab Emirates. And yes, I am a huge Godzilla \nfan.

To me this just sounds \nlike you're someone who suffers from white guilt and you're using Godzilla \nof all things to climb the ol' soap box. And if you really want your \nGodzilla movie to have an Asian-centric feel, watch one of the other 28 \nmovies Toho made over a 50 year span. I get this feeling you haven't seen \nany of them. Now as a longtime fan of Godzilla and of Japanese culture in \ngeneral, I can say I am more than completely satisfied with the \nappreciation the filmmakers have for the original character. Ken Watanabe's \ncharacter is not in fact your stereotypical \"Asian guy is a scientist\" \ncharacter. His name, Dr. Serizawa, is taken directly from the most pivotal \ncharacter from the original 1954 movie, the man who creates the weapon that \nultimately kills the first Godzilla. Another point to reference is that in \nthe first official trailer Serizawa says that in 1954 they tried to kill \nGodzilla with nuclear bombs, disguised as test bombings. 1954 is the year \nof the first movie's release in Japan. And in what I think is the biggest \nshow of reverence and respect for the original, the star of 1954's Gojira, \nAkira Takarada, will have some kind of cameo role in the movie, possibly in \nthe flashbacks to 1954. So there you go, three things the filmmakers did \nthat they didn't need to in order to show respect to the source material of \nthis AMERICAN reboot. I'm saddened to say that some people will probably \naccuse this movie of being \"racist\" because it doesn't \"have enough Asian \npeople\" in it or their role \"isn't big enough\", and to them I'll say Ken \nWatanabe has second billing behind Aaron Taylor-Johnson. And if someone \ncalls me racist or insensitive because of what I've said, then that's just \npathetic.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw9moxfOM68MmnRZpxvE1vQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dr. Forrester", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ps5jzfljfy30se231h1kqhwapxjncq", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T05:26:15.925Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCw9moxfOM68MmnRZpxvE1vQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.362784, "formal_score": 72, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T05:26:15.925Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uDuL5tX1bUE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/a0XHe000fgs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102508293449619480310", "textDisplay": "We're definitely not on the same page here.

I will offer insight and maybe perspective, and I offer it without \nmalice or ill intent. Firstly, yes Hawaii has a very large Asian \npopulations. The most visible being the Japanese, the second would be the \nFilipino's(oes), the third would be the Chinese. There are also large \npopulations of Okinawans and Koreans. Native Hawaiians however are not \n\"Asian\" we are part of the Polynesian race of peoples. We are related to \nthe Tahitians, Samoans and the Maori of New Zealand. These are just few of \nthe Polynesian people there are many others too numerous to list. People \noften do not know that the term \"Native Hawaiian\" when applied to \nNon-Hawaiians is highly offensive to us. For instance people often use the \n\"Term\" \"Native\" to denote people being from somewhere. People will often \nsay something along the lines \"I am a New york native\" or \"I am a \ncalifornia native. While these terms apply in other places, they do not \napply when refering to \"Hawaiian Natives\" Why? because in our case it \nrefers to a specific race of people. So please anyone refering to a \"Native \nHawaiian\" in the future please undserstand that unless that person self \nindentifies as a \"Native Hawaiian\" it is inappropriate and highly \ncontentious to refer to them so. We often run into people who don't know \nhow to address our race and sometimes that can lead to issues. Any \nNon-Hawaiian who is  from Hawaii is called a \"Local\". One however does not \ncall a \"Native Hawaiian\" a \"Local\" it is an insult of the highest order. If \none cannot determin if you are addressing a \"Native\" or a \"Local\" just ask. \nThe term \"Hapa\" has been envogue\" the past few years. It's a Hawaiian word \nthat means mixed blood. More often it means in today's vernacular someone \nwho is half white and some other racial admixture (Hapa Haole= Half White). \nI am not saying that any statements made during the discussion were right \nor wrong, I am just educating.

I will still see this movie \nbecause it looks spectacular.  \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z123tv1islnohf5xj04cjhoabonqejojmxs0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKOGdSbjqZqkawRJYVVnNA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-i71B0pz9kHQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/nAu5ufAESpk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "dirtymonkey22", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T10:53:40.630Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCsKOGdSbjqZqkawRJYVVnNA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.73110000000000008, "formal_score": 14, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T10:53:40.630Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118019767262864239566", "textDisplay": "you have way to  much White Guilt \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z132udrbmvjvw35jt04cht3o4lnpitexov40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF8jWNEFLtiMN0_qw6Angtw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_ZBtbfPNGpY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAH1Y/a8oVJbW42Mw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.7543859649122806, "authorDisplayName": "Amazing Amy", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-10T02:12:58.480Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCF8jWNEFLtiMN0_qw6Angtw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.11151800000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-05-10T02:12:58.480Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117491079793254252717", "textDisplay": "I dont give a fuck where this takes place..wanna see a good Godzilla flick. \nAnd i disagree, Grace.

Japan is more homogenous, so they tend to be more xenophobic, but \nat the same time, curious towards other races/cultures.\n3) I don't think you should blame viewers for being focused on race, as \nHollywood itself is very focused on race. They normally don't like hiring \nlead actors that are non-white, as they think that non-white actors don't \ndraw in large audiences (unless said actor is somebody like Will Smith).\n\nAnd they often take away creative freedom from directors who want to make \nmovies about non-whites. Like with \"Tokyo Drift,\" the director had to fight \nin order to have colorblind auditions, because the studio he was working \nwith wanted the characters to be white. He wanted the main character to be \nAsian, but they didn't want that.\nOr like \"A Moment With You,\" which was cancelled because the director \nwanted an Asian main character. Hollywood producers told him that Asians \narent profitable enough, and that movies need white people in order to be \nsuccessful. So they kept trying to persuade him to use a white actor \ninstead, but when he didn't want to, they cancelled his movie.\nOr like with Mako, who wanted to make a TV show about an Asian protagonist, \nbut Hollywood told him that audiences would shut off the TV if they seen a \nmovie with an Asian hero.\n\nSo racism is very strong in hollywood still.. it's not wrong for people to \ncomplain about the lack of diversity. It's just wrong for people to judge \nthe quality of the film/directing based on the race of the characters."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKryYemkq7LETva2nAO-o_Q", "inappropriate_score": 2.8037383177570092, "authorDisplayName": "SlyMongoose17", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13hxrxpgvqhzjceb22sfphqbxexyzglb", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T00:36:58.846Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKryYemkq7LETva2nAO-o_Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.16955000000000003, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T00:36:58.846Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-19JYuewfDX4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/sxnfRbOV96E/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100880227843231621212", "textDisplay": "And we aren't?

Firstly, \nlet it be known that I have no problems with Johnny Storm being black in \nthe new F4 movie. As for Akira, so long as the plot's right and the acting \nis good, again, I don't care about race. Haven't seen the other films \nyou've mentioned.\n\nNow, you have to understand that Edwards kept repeatedly going back to Toho \ngoing \"Is this okay? Is this good?\", and if they told him no he would scrap \nthose ideas. Toho loves him so much for his co-operation that they \ncontacted Akira Takarada and sent him to visit to the set! He played Ogata \nin the original film. Just google Akira Takarada on the set of Godzilla. \nToho's involvement has been huge here and it wasn't a case of just selling \naway the rights. Gareth Edwards himself is a huge fan and his favorite \nGodzilla film is Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster/Hedorah.\n\nThen you're arguing that he's not staying faithful to the source material \nand I have to disagree. He's a creature given super powers brought on by \nnuclear testing in the pacific, and as we can definitely tell, it's not an \nIguana so I'm willing to bet it's the Godzillasaurus.\n\nEdwards has also said that he wants this movie to be grim. The effect it \nwould have on families and loved ones, and he's taking care so that you'll \nactually care about the characters. \"Because if somebody you don't know \njust gets stomped on, then what do you care? You don't\". It reminds me of \nthe Japanese release of the original film, where a daughter asks her mother \nwhile Godzilla attacks \"Are we going to be with Daddy now?\". That's the \nsort of emotion this movie is going for. The feeling of loss, grieving, \nwhile tackling the inherent nuclear theme that's ever-present. The 98 film \nmade no such attempts.\n\nYou also have to realize that the original film was just as heavily focused \non the military as this film.\n\nToho's involvement in this is much deeper than you previously thought, to \nthe point where it might as well be a full Toho production.\n\nAnd finally I'll point out the timer you see towards the end of this \ntrailer. We had another timed device in the Godzilla franchise, and it was \ncalled the Oxygen Destroyer, developed by Dr. Serizawa. I'm pretty sure \nthat's where they're going with Ken here.\n\nAnd the fact that Toho is all giddy for the Japanese release themselves.\n\nHope you see this comment, hope you respond!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12fivhqqovccpqhp04cdpcorlnfcvhyrp00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMe-WfvbqBe0I1k8YIGMpg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "302CastleMusic", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T03:53:17.732Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnMe-WfvbqBe0I1k8YIGMpg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.17724600000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T03:53:17.732Z", "likeCount": 6, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110865288294196223419", "textDisplay": "I see where you're coming from, but I wouldn't be too worried about these \nissues.

Yes it was \npossible to get it right thematically but having all the things in place \ndoesn't mean it will be successful in the states neither does the actors.\n\nAs you said repeatedly and truthfully the American/domestic Box office \nisn't as significant as it once was. The studios should know that more than \nus. but they still make films focus on American and american \ntravelers/abroad. Thing is they could save money and get less name \nrecognized Asian actors. But america isn't at a lack for Actors and \nAmerican Actors have more name Recognition \"sometimes\" means more sells. \nMaybe Hollywood has loyalty to a degree. Foreign films have a loyalty to \nthere country by hiring their own country's actors. Granted I believe Films \nshould be required to dub or speak English for international box office or \nany language for the country that the movie is promoted.\n\nAlso Brian isn't \"Really\" interesting outside of breaking bad maybe if he \nwere to play a more of a villain (lex) or anti villain. His addition to \nTotal Recall, Argo, Drive, and Contagion didn't help box offices(this is \nwhen B.B was on). I believe his \"Extreme\" hype outside of Breaking bad, \nWhere he was awesome is just a result of band wagon social media pushing \nYoutube and Reddit has this in droves. Great actor though.  \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12dh1yjiqbphb4jb04cd1vq4kedvbxwpj0": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 7, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYpbnpfKCUbtwVJiKMy8Ulg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AjLOWGGP8Qg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/R0M7AgDIe0I/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tebigong101", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T21:43:58.082Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYpbnpfKCUbtwVJiKMy8Ulg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.095056000000000029, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T21:43:58.082Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105694163796872291151", "textDisplay": "Grace handled this awesomely, she ticked off every box as far as issues \nthat needed to be addressed, not really anything I would have added to the \nvideo!\n\nI'm sure as I read the comments below I encounter some dispiriting things.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYpbnpfKCUbtwVJiKMy8Ulg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tebigong101", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12dh1yjiqbphb4jb04cd1vq4kedvbxwpj0", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-11T18:02:59.662Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYpbnpfKCUbtwVJiKMy8Ulg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.13904200000000005, "formal_score": 9, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-11T18:02:59.662Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AjLOWGGP8Qg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/R0M7AgDIe0I/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105694163796872291151", "textDisplay": "+Campbell Vera I've seen the IMDB and saw that there are people of color in \nthe movie and that is nice and for some that is progress, but to me that is \njust... right.\n\nHowever, the important people in this movie are white.

You think that they should replace Bryan Cranston and \nJuliette Binoche with Japanese actors for racial equality, but you don't \nwant to make the film take place in America but Japan for international \nequality... wait, that doesn't make sense.

Johnny Storm, in all the comics, in all alternate \nuniverses has always been white. I don't think they cast him for some grand \nideal about diversity, if they did Susan Storm would be black too. I see it \nmore as the director saying \"I like working with this guy, I'm gonna but \nhim in this movie source material be damned.\"\n\nWhat's more, bringing that in to a discussion about Godzilla is completely \nrandom. Johnny Storm has always been white, Godzilla has always been a \ngiant mutant lizard/dinosaur/whale thing. That's what he's portrayed as in \nthis movie. The white people in this movie, as far as I know aren't based \non any asian people but are all original characters. Choosing who this \nmovie focuses on isn't disrespectful but more a marketing or even a \ncreative choice.\n\nEven the Raid argument, I can see the frustration of a great movie being \nreplaced by a copy, but Raid is not as iconic as Godzilla. People who \nhaven't seen a Godzilla movie still know who Godzilla is. He's a giant \nmonster that attacks Tokyo. Making him a global threat makes him more of a \nthreat. I admit I've only seen one Godzilla movie (Japanese one, not the \nEmmerich one) and listened to many reviews from diehard Godzilla fans and \nI've never had the impression that they have a recurring cast of Japanese \ncharacters. Every movie has new character to follow so why not have an \namerican version with americans in the lead.\n\nAnd while talking about the Emmerich movie, many non Godzilla fans didn't \nlike it because it was a bad movie. All Godzilla fans disliked it because \nthe monster in that movie wasn't Godzilla but a Jurassic Park reject. In \nthat movie the military actually killed Godzilla and I've heard none of the \nGodzilla fans were happy about that.\n\nAnd what's more, we're taking this all from a trailer, or in other words: \nout of context. Hell, we're not even sure where this takes place. I haven't \nseen this movie, neither has any of us so it's too soon to jump on the \n\"this movie is racist and disrespectful\" bandwagon.\n\nFinally, what you said about Bryan Cranston and people don't like him \noutside Heisenberg, fittingly enough is incredibly disrespectful to him as \nan actor. It's him that I'm mostly exited to see in this because he was so \nfantastic in Breaking Bad. But he has to be a good actor to do that, and he \nseems to be doing a great job here. And saying he's not a box-office draw \noutside Heisenberg is foolish because he hasn't had that much work since \nBreaking bad. I think he was in one movie I don't remember that I didn't \neven know he was in. But that's more the movies fault, than his.\n\nAnd how exactly do you know what the majority of people think about that \nsubject? Have you had polls? Do you read minds? Can you see the future? One \nof the most important things you can learn in life is that you don't know \neverything. So I wouldn't worry about what the majority of people think \nbecause it's impossible to wage it either way, considering you follow movie \nnews and behind the scenes drama more than any average movie goer.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ndb1yxpykuxmrp04cjtngeor5hfxjpuo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEUWHUYi7rCH_NUnNmsRzPA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Eicm2wPw2fM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEU/UHPRk-SeN7I/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Joe James", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T23:03:27.623Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEUWHUYi7rCH_NUnNmsRzPA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.0040979999999999905, "formal_score": 58, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T23:09:42.000Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114349055515898338605", "textDisplay": "I think that it is quite obvious that you are mostly concerned with issues \nrevolving around race in relation to this movie.

Wow.\n1. Theres no misleading anything here. From the get go Edwards said that \nthe movie was largely in San Fran and the prologue type section that takes \nplace in 1999 was in Japan.\n2. There have been 28 Godzilla movies thus far (Ive seen all of them at \nleast once) and of the 28, there has been one in the U.S. So what we aren't \nallowed to have one take place here? Edwards is paying homage and respect \nthe the series and its roots but also putting his own spin on it. Hence \nthings like say, Wantanabes (sorry I probably misspelled that) sharing the \nsame name with the scientist from the original. \n3. Godzilla is a giant freaking monster! He can go wherever he wants! Now I \nhavent seen a Godzilla movie in a few years, but I dont remember many of \nthe movies really explaining why Godzilla stayed in Japan. At least the \n1998 movie gave us an explanation to why he came to New York. A stupid one, \nbut it's something. It's arguably more realistic that this movie happens in \nmultiple locations cause guess what, Godzilla CAN MOVE and go WHEREVER HE \nWANTS.\n4.Edwards has a 'mostly american cast' and has 'americanized it' because it \ntook people outside of Japan years to give a crap, and even now fans of the \nseries here are greatly outnumbered by people who dont care. Because news \nflash: A lot of americans didnt get excited or interested when they saw a \nmovie about a monster thats played by a man in a rubber suit and has really \nbad dubbing, not to mention that the Japanese series even had some \nmisfires. Remember Godzillas child and eco-friendly phase? They were huge \nin Japan but people here didnt care for the most part. This is gonna be the \n4th Godzilla movie to see a theatrical release in the USA, idk about the \nrest of the world but I know other than this just Godzilla 1985, Godzilla \n2000 and Zilla were released here. Godzillas 1985 and 2000 did terrible \nhere because noone cared. Whether we like it or not or want to admit it, we \nprefer movies made here to foreign movies. We just do. Gareth Edwards is \ntrying to bring Godzilla to the world because he himself is a huge fan of \nGodzilla and he wants to right the wrongs of the universally hated 1998 \nversion and at the same time make him a commercial success so more than \njust Japan and the minority of people will care. He wants Godzilla to get \nthe love and popularity he deserves, and that Toho wanted him to have and \nthat he deserved from the beginning. Heck Toho left the franchise to die \nafter Final Wars in 2004 but he didnt want that. He sees massive potential \nin the big guy. \nSorry Grace I usually love and agree with you but I am extremely opposed to \nwhat you are saying about this movie. The first movie I remember seeing in \nthe theater was Godzilla 2000 and I have been a lifelong fan ever since. \nThis is easily my most anticipated movie of the year and actually aside \nfrom Star Wars Episode VII, which I heard rumors about all the way back in \n2006, and Jurassic Park 4, which I heard rumors for IN FREAKING 2003, this \nis my most anticipated movie of the last decade. While Star Wars is my all \ntime favorite series and I grew up a Jurassic Park nut (yes I love ALL \nTHREE) Im more excited for this because I actually have seen footage and \nhave seen what they have been doing with it. Star Wars and Jurassic Park \nare still unseen and I remain cautiously optimistic. That my two cents, \neveryone is entitled to an opinion, but they really should be fair ones :)\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z124znta0qzcdl53t22ghpbgamqvjjiso": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtX3O-A1Np_BNx6DJmPuKSw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Uehara Ryoma", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-11T10:14:52.438Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCtX3O-A1Np_BNx6DJmPuKSw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.21371600000000002, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-04-11T10:14:52.438Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112107018395817312521", "textDisplay": "Thank you for pointing out what has been eating at me for quite a while; \nthe cast of this film should be more ethnicly diverse.

Godzilla \nwill be in Japan in one act of the movie, then to Hawaii and San Fransisco. \nGodzilla IS a way of introducing the western audience to the east. \nAudiences have to watch the movie in order to learn/know about the origins \nof Godzilla, and hopefully the movie explains why he goes from point A \n(Japan) to point B (San Fransisco). I understand the whole racial aspect, \nbut who is there to say that there won't be any in the movie. An original \ncast member of the original 1954 Gojira film, Akira Takarada, is going to \nplan an unknown role in the film. The reason why everyone is ok with \nchanging the racial ethnicity is because since it is an American film, it \nis expected to show less, I repeat less Japanese characters because it \nmostly takes place in America. However, we won't know if there won't be any \nJapanese or Asian characters. Now, speaking of characters, lest be honest. \nDo we want to follow the story of an everyday family that is not part of \nthe military or nuclear scientist? When we see the film we'll follow a more \ninteresting set of characters because the military and scientist add to the \ndynamic of the film, and obviously the film will show the effect of \nencountering such a monster. Even though they're soldiers and scientist, \nthey are still human. The 1998 film is NOT Godzilla. That creature did not \nhave the characteristics of the original Godzilla, and the story was not \nremotely good or did justice to the original film. The 1998 film lacked \ncharacters that we wanted to care about. In the 2014 film, they will do \njustice to the original film and have characters that we should care about, \nthat and we'll all see the true Godzilla character.

The fact that Toho sold the \nrights to an American studios basically confirms that they accepted that \nthere was going to be alterations to the story, and if you're so into this \nidea of lead Asian characters, shouldn't they be speaking their native \nlanguage for the entire movie, so as to make it 'believable'. I'm all for \ndiversification but hearing that the Raid is to be remade with white actors \nin the major roles in order to basically kill off the original is sad and \nreally undermines the hard work of that Indonesian studio.\n\nAs you said that seems contradictory, for me to agree with one but not the \nother, but in the case of Godzilla its not that simple; the cast of \nGodzilla should not be so important as to dictate the exact race of the \ncharacters because the real the focus is on that 200 foot tall lizard that \ndestroys everything, where-as the cast in The Raid are meant to be Asian, \nwhich is crucial to the story. Also if you want another Asian character at \nthe fore-front; what about Godzilla? (although he isn't an actual actor, he \ndoes represent Japan), in terms of the average person, when they hear \n'Godzilla' they immediately think of Japan. He is the best Japanese Film \nicon and everyone knows it.\n\nI'm Irish and I cringe at all the futile attempts at Irish accents and \nimpersonations in movies but I don't cry about it. Using your logic (of \nrace playing their own race), every portrayal of an Irish person on screen \nshould be done by an Irish person. I have no qualms with Americans \nattempting Irish accents, tis funny when they try. Tom Cruise in far and \naway along-side Nicole Kidman spring to mind, but its okay cause its just a \nmovie. I honestly don't think people believe the Irish actually speak like \nwe're gargling water and constantly waiting for the moment where our \n'sing-song' voices break out into a full 'Diddle-Dee Diddle' song. If you \nwant Irish accents watch \"wind that shakes the barley\" (Cillian Murphy \n[scarecrow from batman] is brilliant in that) or \"Michael Collins\" [Liam \nNeeson shows his diverse Irish accent]. \n\nBut seriously if people want an authentic Godzilla movie, with Asian \nactors, set in Japan, you'll have to get out Google translate 'cause the \nentire movie should be in Japanese. But then the film can only appeal to a \nsmall community in the larger sense of the movie industry, \"and that's \nalways what studios want for their blockbusters.\"\n\noh you didn't think of that? Whoopsie... B)\n\nI also have no problem with characters swapping race, like Michael B Jordan \nas Johnny Storm. My issue is the massive plot hole this leaves; the fact \nthat both he and his sister were originally both white but only he gets the \nrace swap leaving his 'sister' (?) still white (that is if shes still his \nsister, which will also bug me if they change).

The French secret \nservice agent stole the show in that one.

First off, we're not calling for an all \nwhite cast, that's just what we have to work with whether we like it or \nnot, but just from the trailer, I can tell this movie is paying so much \nmore attention to the origins of Godzilla than the 98 version could ever \nhope for. Just the references in the trailers... the TRAILERS make this \nbetter than the 98. It starts in Japan, stays in the Pacific, Godzilla was \nborn in 1954, and is a nuclear dinosaur instead of a... weird \nraptor-iguana. And also, really fun fact, the 1998 monster is now legally \ncalled (I'm not joking, look it up) Zilla. So the film may be called \nGODZILLA but it is no longer a Godzilla film.\nAnd this movie isn't a remake, it's a reboot. Very different terms there. A \nremake is when it's supposed to be the same movie, but \"updated.\" A reboot, \nwhich this is, is when there's an original plot, contains the same \nconcept/character (Godzilla) but is new.\nAnd, if you want to see the difference between Roland Emmerich and Edwards \nis, look up the 98 trailer.\nAnd wow.

I think it's so true what you're saying about \nthese stereotypes that are created and then reinforced by today's \nentertainment. Some people might think, why do you make race such a big \nissue in this film, if it's about Godzilla, etc etc, and yeah, I am still \nexcited for the film, and will probably see it, but I truly hope it \nrespects the source material, like you say you wish it had. It is very \nimportant to show the japanese and asian influence in this film, because it \nowes Japan that at the very least. Godzilla is a great story and franchise, \nand if Hollywood is to do an American version, it should pay tribute to the \noriginal country by using the film as advertisement to Asian cinema and \nAsian culture in general. Otherwise people will just view it as another \nHollywood creation. Like you said it's exactly the same as with The Raid, \nbut since The Raid is a much newer franchise, fans from the original \nindonesian films obviously feel more offended by the hollywood remake, than \nGodzilla fans would by this new Godzilla remake. Somehow, since it's older \nproperty, people feel it's much more malleable and it's ok to tamper with \nit. But it is NOT. I loved The Raid, and am so looking forward to Berenthal \nwhen it comes out here in Peru, but I would hate to see people recognize \nthe new Hollywood version as the only version. Do you think people are okay \nthe whitewashing in Godzilla because it's an older franchise? As opposed to \nthe Raid? Also, can you think of any way Hollywood could successfully \nremake The Raid without being disrespectful to the source material?

I \nbelieve that certain films should stay true to their culture instead of \nfollowing what Hollywood does all the time and they would stand out more if \nthat's what they did. But the sad truth is that they don't. We fall into \nthese stereotypes about certain cultures and we all know that's never \nreally the case. I think we all have these double standards as you \nmentioned with changing Johnny Storm (I personally just like Chris Evans in \nthat role), but I do feel it's unfair to say 'oh, we can change this and \neveryone will love it' but to be too afraid to change something else \nbecause maybe people won't love it. As much as I enjoy a good film, I do \nbelieve that films should stay true to their culture and they would still \nbe great films if executed correctly. But- When I go see Godzilla, will I \nbe sitting there saying that because it's not authentic that I can't enjoy \nit?

They wanted him to hire a \ncaucasian actor instead, and so the director had to fight to have \ncolorblind casting call for his lead characters,\n\nOr with Anansi Boys, a fantasy book in which all of the characters were \nblack, but Hollywood refused to consider black actors for the live action \nmovie because they said that \"of course the characters won't be black in \nthe movie because black people don't like fantasy,\"\n\nSo race matters in Hollywood. It shouldn't, because actors should be chosen \nbased on talent, rather than race. This doesn't mean Godzilla is a bad \nmovie, it just means that Hollywood judges on race.

This is my first time commenting, I think. Anyway I really enjoy \nyour show but I do have one question about this particular video. How did \nyou get all that from a trailer?\nFrom my point of view the trailers that have been released have revealed \nonly specific images from the film. We still know absolutely nothing about \nthe actual story and characters. Also Gareth Edwards has stated a few that \nhe is a huge Godzilla fan so he knows how to make a Godzilla film. At least \nI hope he does, no one will really know until it's released. Bryan Cranston \n(sorry if I spelt his name wrong) has also stated he's a life long Godzilla \nfan so he's probably in it because he wanted to be and impressed them in \nthe audition (unless they specifically wanted him).\nI'm a huge Godzilla fan and have seen all 29 movies, including the 1998 \none). From what I've heard I have faith in Gareth and his vision and he has \na huge responsibility. He's not only got to impress all the Godzilla fans \nout there but he's got the whole future of Kaiju movies ( again spelling) \nsitting on his shoulders. Not to mention probably his career.\nMy thoughts on the nationality (I wish people would stop saying race of \npeople because there is only 1 race of human), it really depends on who \nwanted to be in the film and who they could get. \n\nAny way thats's my thoughts. I'm not usually into debating but it could be \nfun.\nOnce again great show and I look forward to your reply.\nMy original question still stands but I think I have a vague idea.

And my \n\"Radical Conclusion\" is not radical. I've simply seen more than one movie. \nIf you watch enough of them you start catching on.\n4: This trailer does not Give you enough information to decided if the \nmovie has a good story, you have chosen to defend the movie for merits it \nhas not yet revealed it has yet. Remember the last American Godzilla? That \nmovie had amazing trailers, and ad campaigns! and I might get beat up for \neven mentioning it now.\n5:\"Focusing on race and Characters\" We simply Noticed the main guy was \nwhite and some kind of expert in Japan. And then we both went on a rant \nabout how \"Hollywood\" Always does this, and is constantly guilty of \n\"Whitewashing\". (Plenty of evidence to support this, it is not a random \nradical claim. and if you watch Grace's reviews, This is not the first time \nthis came up.

The only problem i have with it is Godzilla looks to be made into \n\"A force of nature\" or mindless monster. And if you have seen any Godzilla \nmovies you would know that He is a character, with a personality. And I \ndon't like that it looks like that has been left out.

I was talking about Hollywood. And yes, Hollywood is \nvery Racist and that is something that is not debatable. Secondly setting \nis important, if your initial setting is in Japan, then it is not \nunreasonable to ask for a Japanese Actor. But the studio puts a \"White guy\" \nin the Japanese Nuclear power plant as some kind of Expert. As if they guys \nwho built the plant don't have any experts of their own. (And This is \nsolely because if the Lead character was not a white guy, the movie WOULD \nmake less money. Hollywood has a specific formula to make money and does \nnot deviate from that formula.) Nextly, You're calling Grace and I a racist \nbecause we are Upset about the lack of diversity in lead role casting. \nThink about that, take all the time you need. We're upset because Hollywood \nrefuses to use anything but white actors in major roles...... so we call \nthem out on it.. aaaaand we're the racists. This is a classic case of \nHollywood taking some foreign story (Godzilla) and Whitewashing it.\n\nSo, perhaps if you pull your head out of your ass and look objectively you \nwill see whats going on in Hollywood. Also, I thought the Trailer looked \ninteresting. I think again Hollywood failed to capture that Godzilla is a \ncharacter, and not a force of nature (Random destruction). So let's see \nwhat happens.

If this were so, \nI'm sure the majority would have similar concerns which isn't the case. \nMost of the footage shown looks like it take place in the US, specifically \nin San Francisco and Las Vegas.\n\nI see where you're coming from with the cultural argument, but it's more \nimportant for stories like Akira because the culture is so significant to \nthe story that it couldn't properly work if set in America. Godzilla may \nhave carried a lot of symbolism of Japan's past once, but not so much now \nas later films primarily portrayed him simply as a destructive kaiju that \ndefended and attacked the world. I just don't feel the attachment is as \nstrong as you suggest.\n\nAlso, why follow a group of Hawaiian kids who will not be relevant \nthroughout the story, especially since they will essentially be limited to \nonly one part of the film? Why follow a character in China Town just \nbecause they're Asian? Does their race suddenly make them relevant to the \nstory? I feel this decision would only lose focus since Godzilla will be a \nglobal threat this time. Sure it'd be nice to have Cranston's character \nreplaced with someone who was Japanese, but Cranston is also the most \nmarketable actor in the entire film and clearly grabbed the director's \nattention with his screen test. Race shouldn't determine a role, the acting \nand story should.\n\nI mentioned this on in your previous review, but I don't remember a lot of \npeople being upset over Johnny Storm's race change. I remember people \nprimarily being upset over the possibility that Johnny wouldn't be Sue's \nbrother, which is more crucial to the character than race. Concern over \nrelationships of characters is actually important to the story.\n\nI personally don't mind if another culture remakes something that was \noriginally made in the US, and it's not like the majority of Godzilla films \nfrom Japan are concerned with race. While I love The Raid, I have too admit \nsome great remakes have from adapting foreign films, such as The Departed. \nI don't have a problem with The Raid. I just doubt it'll be as well made as \nthe original or offer a unique perspective on the subject. \n\nI'll conclude this by saying I agree it would benefit everyone to encourage \na blend of different cultures in a film and to expose themselves to the \noriginal film. That being said, I don't feel there is anything wrong in \nseeing one cultures interpretation of a theme or concept. Saying that \nGodzilla can only be viewed through a lens that is strictly Japanese. We \nsay this annoys us here in the US, but again it happens everywhere else \nwhen they decide to adapt something made in the US. The difference is \nHollywood has the burden of being popular, and therefore is more exposed \nand pressured to represent everyone even if it does nothing to actual story \nbeing told.\n\nThis was a great topic of discussion and I'm glad you addressed this topic \nin a full video. While I may not entirely agree with you I do feel this \ndiscussion is valuable.

I won't deny that there may be \ndiscrimination or bias seeing as I'm not a studio executive and couldn't \nknow. I will point out though that people like Will Smith, Denzel \nWashington and Samuel L Jackson started at the bottom and proved to be \nmarketable by standing out. I'd also like to clarify that my point isn't \nthat white-washing doesn't exist but that the actor should first be \ncompelling in the role and that the relationship between them and the other \nactors and director work. Not all actors can play every role offered to \nthem, and Grace was suggesting the one actor to be replace be the one who \nis most marketable and has displayed the most range out of the cast.\n\n-------------------------\n\nI've been to San Francisco many times and realize it's diverse, so I know \nwhat you mean by the false representation given of the US. In this case \nthough, it seem like there are 3 characters. Cranston, the soldier kid, and \nthe Asian scientist hunting Godzilla. Neither of them look to be playing \nthe role of the average terrified citizen. I expect we'll see Asian people \non screen, just not servicing the main plot.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThat's unfortunate that people see it that way. I remember when I first \nheard the news I was surprised a little by the change then surprised again \nthat Sue was still white, leading me and many other fans of the comics that \nFox made the mistake of not having them as siblings unless one was adopted \nor if they were \"siblings\" through close relations. I found that to be a \nlot more controversial than the race change to be honest. It's another \nreason why I don't think it's a relevant example. Unlike Akira, Godzilla \nisn't a concept that is so strongly connected to Japan unless you're \nstrictly looking at the original from the 50's. Most of the characters in \nthis film are new, so they haven't really changed their race from one \ninterpretation.\n\nI agree though, it seems African Americans are more commonly used compared \nto Asians, Latinos or anyone from the Middle East. That's unfortunate and \nsomething I hope improves over time. The Fast and the Furious franchise was \nreported to have done better because it was ethnically diverse compared to \nothers."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101324036771148071549", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ssenajdag", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12sc1jzaumlz5v2322chh4gguubtd3up", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T05:19:02.370Z", "likeCount": 0, "sentiment_score": -0.55265999999999993, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T05:19:02.370Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101324036771148071549", "textDisplay": "\"Race shouldn't determine a role, the acting and story should.\"\nThe problem with this is that race already plays a big part in Hollywood. \nYou're talking about it an idealized way- as if racism no longer exists in \nHollywood.\nIt's like this... Hollywood producers need to make money, and they think \nthat movies about non-white people do not make enough money. Hollywood \nwants directors and actors they can make $$ off of, it's not just about \ntalent or quality (otherwise, why is Megan Fox still relevant?)\n\nThey want lead actors who draw in large audiences, and they think that \nnon-white actors make viewers disinterested (unless said actor is somebody \nlike Will Smith or Samuel L. Jackson, Hollywood's favorite token black \nactors). So they usually refused to fund or greenlight films about \nnon-white characters.\n\nExamples being (since people never believe me):\n-\"Redtails,\" which Hollywood refused to fund because of its all black cast \n(they said \"black people aren't marketable enough\"). So the director, \nGeorge Lucas, used money out of his own pocket to cover production costs on \nthe film ($58m). The movie bombed, and Hollywood blamed it on the fact that \nthe movie had an all black cast, rather than the poor directing. And so now \nthey are afraid to make high budget \"black films.\"\n-\"A Moment With You,\" which was cancelled because the directors (Wong Fu \nProductions) wanted an Asian lead actors. Hollywood producers told them \nthat Asians \"arent profitable enough,\" and that movies need white actors in \norder to make money.\n-\"Anansi Boys,\" a fantasy story influenced by west African folklore. \nHollywood wanted to make a movie of it, but told the author \"the characters \ncan't be black in the movie because black people don't like fantasy.\"\n-\"Tokyo Drift,\" in which the director had to fight to have a colorblind \nauditions for the lead characters. He wanted to chose an Asian actor, but \nthe studio he was working with was bent on having a white actor, and so \nthey got their way.\n-Mako was turned down by Hollywood executives when he wanted to make a TV \nshow about an Asian protagonist, because Hollywood executives told him that \n\"viewers would shut off the TV if they seen an Asian protagonist.\"\n\nSo yeah. Movies SHOULDN'T be about race, but race still plays a big part in \nwhich projects Hollywood choses to greenlight.\n*__________*\n\"Most of the footage shown looks like it take place in the US, specifically \nin San Francisco and Las Vegas.\"\nI live in San Francisco, there are a lot of Asians here. Yet when I see SF \non TV, it's like we don't exist. \n\nAnd henever I see movies/shows that take place in San Francisco high \nschools, I feel like laughing. They portray our high schools as being 90% \nwhite, when in reality a lot of them are over 60-70% Asian. I went through \nhigh school only meeting about 20 white people (out of 2000), yet in the \nmovies its the reverse. Very funny..\n*_________________*\n\"But I don't remember a lot of people being upset over Johnny Storm's race \nchange.\" \nA lot of people were mad because \"political correctness.\" \n\nI have mixed feelings on Johnny Storm myself. I'm not upset with him \nlooking a different race than his sister, because I'm Asian/white myself \nand I look a completely different race than my sister (I look Asian, she \nlooks white). I think multiracial families need more notice in Hollywood. \nHowever, I didn't see the point in making Johnny Storms family multiracial.\n\nAnd I notice that whenever Hollywood casts non-white actors for \ntraditionally white characters, they usually cast already well known black \nmen (Will Smith, Samuel L. Jackson, Idris Elba, Michael B. Jordan). I think \nit's because black men have had the most success in Hollywood (out of all \nminorities).

I like you. I like \nwhat you have to say. I like the depth you go into your reviews. And I like \nhow you talk about the many aspects of film making. However, lately I feel \nlike you have gone off a bit of the deep end. Recently I feel like every \ntime I go into my subscriptions list and click on one of your videos I end \nup hearing about how they should have hired a woman or her role was too \nsexy, or they should have hired a black guy, or black woman, or Asian, or \nsome other minority and because they didn't they are impeding on human and \ncivil rights. Yes there are times when characters can change race or sex \nbut then there are times when they can't in order to stay congruent with \nthe original source material. I don't care if johnny storm is black, BUT if \nhe is his SISTER also needs to be black. In addition to my lack of caring \ntowards weather or not the storm siblings are the white or black or mexican \nor asian, I do care that they cast them that way to help the story and not \njust because oh well affirmative action or lets say we think it will sell \nmore tickets to a different demographic. I want to see a good movie. I \ndon't necessarily want to see a politically correct movie. \n    Just because this movie is in Asia or San Fran or Hawaii does not meet \nit needs to have asian cast members. I agree that the mixture of extras on \nset should reflect the natural environment in those areas, but in no way \nneeds to reflect towards the main cast. Especially in this case where there \nis a father son relationship with a shared experience of the mother's \ndeath. They should most likely be of the same race. \n    As for you being led on by this movie taking place in Japan I was never \nat comic con and all I have known is that this is an american adaptation of \na japanese story which will predominantly take place in the U.S. That is \nall I have taken from the reviews I have heard/read and the trailers I have \nseen. I grew up watching Godzilla movies on VHS. They were dubbed, they \nwere subtitled and there weren't any americans running around in them. But \nI have been to Japan a few times and seen plenty of white faces. Don't you \nthink it would sound silly for you to call up producers over there now and \nsay hey why didn't you put any whites in your japanese movie.  This is now \nan american movie take on a japanese character. The fact that part of this \nmovie is set in Japan is enough of a nod. Get the kid in this movie that \ncontrolled the giant robot that helped godzilla. I can't remember it's \nname, but it would make more sense than saying hey american movie guy throw \nin some token asians because because because there is diversity in this \nworld and I want you to force it down peoples throats that godzilla came \nfrom japan.  I bet if they had a group of asians yelling here comes Go ji \nra you would have a problem with them being steriotypical but hey you \nwanted japanese in the movie and if i was there I would be running away \nscreaming too, You seem to have an agenda about getting minorities cast in \nmovies that work perfectly well as they are. If I was a minority I would \nhate to be cast in something just because I fill a color void. \n    How many movies did that guy make who did Amadia i'm sorry I can't \nremember his name or the spelling for that movie but he made a ton of money \nduring his run with those shows. And if I'm not mistaken they were filled \nwith black actors and actresses. I would wage money that if you have done \nany reviews of his movies you probably didn't say we need more white or \njews or egyptian americans in those movies. There are plenty of them living \nin this country. But I don't think he lost out on not having them in there. \nHe created his vision and it's his right to do so.\n    Saying that americans are always the experts in a movie is hardly the \ncase. in every space movie it's some Russian guy. And I have no proof \nCranston is the expert in the movie, maybe he is learning from a Japanese \nexpert, but it works better making cranston the lead because he can \ncontinue the story back to the U.S.\n    My final thought is about how you said it's not about taking the harder \nside of the argument but that you are taking the right side. I feel that is \ncompletely in the eye of the beholder and as a critic and movie reviewer it \nis unethical to say you are the right side of the argument. It is perfectly \nfine for you to say you think you are on the right side but to say you \nchose the right side is just not good.  \n   \nI love watching your videos and your reviews and appreciate hearing your \nviewpoints on controversial subject matter. But I can't stand when you \nstart to talk about why there should have been a minority cast for a role. \nWhomever is in charge of casting gets to make those choices. If we are \ntalking about white washing asian roles then yes you are 100% correct. In \nfilm class I remember watching old films like Piccalillis seeing white \nactors portray them self as an asian. That shouldn't happen today. But I \nhave no problem with a cast being chosen because thats the way a director \ncan relate to the subject matter or it's simply their vision. I would love \nto have camera present when someone tells spike lee to hire more whites and \nportray them in a better light.  \n\nplease feel free to private message me to discuss further. I watch all of \nyour videos and really love all of them. only your casting issues upset me.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z125szwhhrfpd1uxk04cjjfz3leoyv3jsdk": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDhOr4hQ7Olj4eXwGXjJYNw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "paul matthews", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T11:43:24.688Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDhOr4hQ7Olj4eXwGXjJYNw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.40582800000000002, "formal_score": 26, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T11:43:24.688Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114505250338778165535", "textDisplay": "Good to see you taking Godzilla more seriously, I had thought that you been \nmaking poor insights on the previous trailers, such as your description of \nGodzilla, where there possible 2 or 3 other monsters in the film, etc\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12tw3ag5tbudtcyc04cghmzdpfvsbf54cs": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVvgsn1i8WlzhlwCghMkgQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TnFzkKrJ8zM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/Onh6zt1mzNU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "sinosleep007", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T06:23:30.042Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDVvgsn1i8WlzhlwCghMkgQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.21568600000000004, "formal_score": 90, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T06:23:30.042Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107721975048817743698", "textDisplay": "The only problem I have with the Johnny Storm change is that they didn't \nchange Susan Storm too.

I knew that the film did \nmainly take place in America, but I thought Japan and Japanese people would \nplay a major role. I am disappointed to see that Japan doesn't feature as \nmuch as I thought it did, but at least they seem to acknowledge japan to an \nextent, albeit a limited one. I don't think it looks like the piece of crap \nEmmerich version. That movie didn't have a lot going for it. It had down \nright stupid scenes and dumb comedy. Overall it just felt like a chesy \nspecial effects 90s movie with a big lizard, not Godzilla. This movie looks \nalot more serious, and captures the horror movie like tone of the original- \nwhat would actually happen if Godzilla attacked. The beast in this IS \nGodzilla and not a big lizard and the characters seem to have more depth \nthen the 1998 version. I still think the film, visually is artistic and has \na memorable look and style to it, again the 1998 version felt generic and \ncheesy, like and extended version of the last part of Jurassic park 2. \n\nIn terms of a Japanese setting, whilst I am disappointed it doesn't feature \nas much as I thought, I do like how they're going for a global feel here \nand I think that makes sense in terms of a realistic Godzilla movie. As for \ncast, yes we do need more asian cast members in general, but if i had to \nchoose between an asian cast and Bryan cranston, I'd pick Cranston. Also, \nand I might be wrong here, if Legendary is trying to make a movie that goes \ndown well in china, casting it Japanese heavy might not be a good idea as \nChinese people don't seem to like Japanese people. But having a multiple \nChinese characters in this film would seem culturally insensitive towards \nJapan. What do you think about this idea Grace ? Overall though yes i would \nlike a more Japanese focused film but at least they acknowledge it to an \nextent, which is better then most films. \n\nIn terms of how this differs from the the two cases you mentioned, Michael \nB Jordan in FF and The Raid remake, well it's different in each case. I \nthink that downplaying the Japanese element in this film is disappointing \nbecause Godzilla is not only Japans most famous export (arguable :p) but \nJapanese culture is kinda entrenched in the Godzilla mythos, that whole \npost nuclear war effects/destructive power of nature when messed with \ntheme, this is also prevalent in other Japanese movies like Akira. On the \nother hand i think MBJ in FF is a brilliant as a) we need more black \nsuperheroes b) being white isn't integral to the character c) You can be \nAmerican and Black, as their isnt a race connected with america other then \nnative americans d) it updates it, as there are alot of black people in \namerica so a black hero in a team up film makes sense and e) FF isn't \nexactly a famous american export, you guys have so many exports ! As for \nthe Raid remake, i think it's alot worse. People recognise that Godzilla is \na Japanese creation, and Japan has a healthy film industry. Indonesia does \nnot, and people will not recognise that the Raid is of Indonesian origin, \n(though the film was made by a fellow welshman :D). The film has done alot \nto bring Indonesia up on the international film stage, so in that way the \nraid is quite a special film. That why it would be a big shame to see that \ntrampled on.\n\nHope you read this Grace and would love to here your thought :) Always love \nit when you get into these meaty issues, ignore the hate !\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101324036771148071549", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ssenajdag", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13hh33hnrzgtjvia04cfpo4mripijdrl1s", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T07:05:48.877Z", "likeCount": 0, "sentiment_score": -0.050683999999999951, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T07:05:48.877Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101324036771148071549", "textDisplay": "It takes place in San Francisco..

Why would I want to deal with the headache of being accused \nof being a sexist for just making a video game, when I can avoid that by \nsimply making the game focus on a male protagonist? This is why I've always \nfelt that the people who constantly accuse female video game characters of \nbeing sexist are doing themselves a disservice, because they're also \nusually the same people who complain that there aren't enough female \nprotagonists in video games, and all they're doing is making game \ndevelopers more reluctant to use female characters out of fear of being \nlabelled a sexist.\n\nI hadn't really thought about this until now, but this probably applies to \nother forms of art and entertainment as well. If I were making a movie, I'd \nbe reluctant to make the movie focus on anyone other than white Americans \nliving in America, because I wouldn't want to attempt portraying someone \nelse's culture and have to deal with being called a racist because I got \nsomething wrong or made an innocent mistake. People tend to not like it \nwhen people of other ethnic or cultural backgrounds try to portray their \nown culture in art or entertainment. Not too long ago I read a story about \nKaty Perry being accused of racism because she did a performance that had a \nJapanese theme, but part of her outfit was Chinese apparently. Also, some \ncomplained that the entire performance was out of line, because they felt \nthat it was disrespectful for a \"white privileged\" performer to portray \nJapanese culture in one of her performances. Another example is a recent \nepisode of How I Met Your Mother where they did a parody of old Japanese \nKung Fu movies. Some people found the episode offensive and the creators \nhad to issue an apology.\n\nWho the hell would want to deal with that? I know I wouldn't. So I can't \nblame anyone else for not wanting to deal with it. I don't think it would \nbe worth the headache for them to try to make this Godzilla movie focus on \nJapanese culture or Japanese characters. If you're going to(and I don't \nmean you, Grace, but people in general) cry racism, or sexism, or \nwhatever-ism every single time someone tries to portray your race, gender, \nor culture in art or entertainment, then don't be surprised when fewer \npeople are interested in portraying your race, gender, or culture in art or \nentertainment.\n\nI personally didn't have a problem with them changing Johnny Storm's race, \nexcept that I think they should have changed Sue Storm's race too, since \nthey're supposed to be brother and sister. The fact that they only changed \nJohnny's race makes it obvious that he's just their token black guy. That \nbeing said, I think the reason why a lot of other people had a problem with \nthem changing Johnny Storm's race, but not changing the race of the \ncharacters of Godzilla is simple. The Fantastic 4 is the focus of the \nFantastic 4 movies. They're the ones people want to see, and so naturally \npeople are going to be more protective of those characters. Where as the \nfocus of Godzilla is Godzilla. The human characters are an after thought. \nAs long as Godzilla looks the way people think he should, most people \naren't going to care what the human characters look like. This is why I \nthink that this change isn't a big deal. Even Asian Godzilla fans are going \nto watch a Godzilla movie to see Godzilla. So I don't think they're going \nto care too much about the setting or the race of the people Godzilla is \ntrying to step on.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxone5IbAhmsMo2DGvXyIqg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Serenify10", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z124cznqoxbscbpek23gz3zprk3osjg5e04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T14:02:25.883Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxone5IbAhmsMo2DGvXyIqg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.7960259999999999, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T14:02:25.883Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MVKKFt66noY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE8/C-itZWYXaZM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101031858233557506186", "textDisplay": "Everything was well said my friend."}}]}, "z13bvnhwmt2tydf5p04cjp1zklq0tfl44z00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNlsIQmiafq0A0Q5sw8tEgw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uTUq9AIoaPw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANk/QTv0UBywlCw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "V Ingram", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T20:29:06.176Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNlsIQmiafq0A0Q5sw8tEgw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.8566262, "formal_score": 4, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T20:29:06.176Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105714060542402622251", "textDisplay": "Grace, I love how you talk about not just movies and trailers, but how \nthese movies and other media affect and reflect our society.

Did I get that \nstraight Grace? Sure I would like to have a little more Japanese people \ndepicted in the movie but, it's that argument that you said for the last \ntwo reviews \"What is it like if this happen to me?\"  It happen to Japan 60 \nyears ago now Legendary is doing what that crap of a 1998 movie should have \ndone; what would happen if this indestructible creature came to the shores \nof the US?  Sorry Grace but I have to somewhat disagree with you on this \none.  The focus is on Godzilla and staying true to what he his and the Icon \nthat he is.  In your last reviews you never asked yourself or the audience, \n\"what is that large skeleton that that scientific team was walking \nthrough?\"  \"They're more monsters hear too, what's the story on them?\" \n It's also a indestructible 350ft tall, walking breathing radioactive \n\"dinosaur\" in a film by definition is should look like a Roland Emerich \nfilm, but with more of the source material in it.  You want this movie to \nsucceed because of the first trailer, unfortunately it has to succeed \nwithout the main focus in Japan that's just the way it is and you know it. \n Again, the subject should be about Godzilla \"the King of Monsters\" and I \nthink Legendary is doing just that with all the info I got on this film. \n Would like to hear back from you on this one Grace, also look at the \nGodzilla films of the 90's, I heard that the Legendary film makers love \nthose ones.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13xfhqinmfetjvxo04cgxcg4xa1gtggj3w": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyxckFvG2keR-4pN1UjRnRw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HHF3f_3Iqlk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAvk/4A9xjrIsCsg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "atanu patwary", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T23:26:27.956Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCyxckFvG2keR-4pN1UjRnRw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46341199999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T23:26:27.956Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115120091368194513663", "textDisplay": "you really think 24 is the reason we have Barack Obama??? seriously?

What about Tesla? He immigrated from \nthe Austria and he was an expert albeit working under Thomas Edison for a \nwhile, he was Caucasian as well. \n   Now, a majority of average viewers who saw the first teaser trailer knew \nthat the location of the HALO jump was in San Francisco, so I don't \nunderstand how it could be misinterpreted as being a pure Japanese location \nfilm. Like you've already pointed out, you're now aware that the film takes \nplace in a few locations and I'd like to point out that the team in charge \nof creating the movie has said, \"we wanted the film to feel like a global \nthreat, that this can happen anywhere and everywhere\", I'm paraphrasing of \ncourse, but that is very close to what was said. I don't really think that \nthe advertising was necessarily \"misleading\" as the comic con experience \nand official posters could be considered the origin of Godzilla as well as \nan easy way to parallel the new movie to the old, sounds like they did a \ngood job of \"pulling from the source material.\" \n   As for how much other races will be playing a role in the film, we've \nonly seen short glimpses and trailers, so I don't understand how you can \nmake the assumption that the film won't showcase the citizens of Japan, \nHawaii, etc., at the same time, I'd think it'd be MORE stereotypical and \ncliche to highlight specifically the Asian cultures in scenes of everyday \nlife or running away from where Caucasian people tend to flock. I would \nthink it'd make people sigh and think, \"wow...really? filming a ton of \nAsians running away from Chinatown? As if we weren't aware of that culture \nalready.\" It'd be better just to show a ton of mixed people intermingling \nand running in fear than to highlight one specific race, which Legendary \nhasn't done in the trailers, they've shown both citizens and tourists of \nall races. As for Ken Watanabe's role in the film, the average viewer may \nnot assume that he has a huge role based on the trailer, but anyone who has \nbeen following the Godzilla viral marketing or goes on forums knows \notherwise. There are files on him on the mutoresearch website, there's \ninput codes regarding his name, pictures, files, etc. so I highly doubt \nthat his role is just a shout out and his role is small. \n   To address the source material and how Toho signed off on all of this, \nthis movie pulls HEAVILY from the source material, from Gareth saying there \nwill be easter eggs in the film that pays homage to the original Godzilla \nfilms to the reference of a 1954 attack/situation. Also, this movie \nhighlights and tributes the original message Godzilla originally had..that \nnuclear power/the arrogance of man is the downfall of us, that we toy with \nnature as if it's in our control, I'd say that is pulling from the source \nmaterial. I'd also like to point out my own theory that the original \nGodzilla film from 1954 was to bring about the message of nuclear energy \nand at the time the film didn't really highlight it as a global event, \nGareth is modernizing this message and building upon it to make it \nrealistic, like I pointed out earlier, that disaster can happen anywhere, \nit can be a global event...again, pulling from the source material, all \nthis probably being a good reason as to why Toho signed off on all this, \nbecause it ISN'T another American Godzilla, it's a very Original homage to \nthe Japanese Godzilla. \n  This is pretty much what I have to say, it's lengthy, but it's from \nsomeone's point of view who is genuinely interested in the film and doesn't \nsee race being an issue as race doesn't even seem to be an issue..possibly \nbecause I've done my research and not because I'm programmed to think only \nCaucasian people can be in American films. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zjvhaski1tbi1x222edyi0vf1f1jbd04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 3, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCTrJoKnCMGtAPPidIIwW2w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-91eMnGHaS6I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFc/CZHy9uyRuIM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheMeta88", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T19:46:02.546Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCTrJoKnCMGtAPPidIIwW2w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.72200599999999993, "formal_score": 11, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T19:46:02.546Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113539000609336407256", "textDisplay": "\"This place has been diverse since the Pilgrims showed up.\" \n\n...No not really.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxDa3khZadEgEOIORkeYpEQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "buciallstar", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12zjvhaski1tbi1x222edyi0vf1f1jbd04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T20:11:01.848Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxDa3khZadEgEOIORkeYpEQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.5152239999999999, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T20:11:01.848Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HCR9t2Uv1LU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/193qvmN6XrQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118079666405044067852", "textDisplay": "+TheMeta88\nyeah I wasn't too sure about italian and germans, that's why the 'I guess' \nin front of it, but I am very sure about the former."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCTrJoKnCMGtAPPidIIwW2w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheMeta88", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12zjvhaski1tbi1x222edyi0vf1f1jbd04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T20:04:48.111Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCTrJoKnCMGtAPPidIIwW2w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.20958199999999999, "formal_score": 92, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T20:04:48.111Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-91eMnGHaS6I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFc/CZHy9uyRuIM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113539000609336407256", "textDisplay": "+buciallstar Probably not many Germans and Italians just yet.

To give a 'white role' to a person of colour \nshows a movement for stronger representation for \"minorities\"; whereas \nmaking a POC character white, shows that that aspect of the characters, or \nincreasing racial representation isn't important. It further diminishes \nchance for growth within the media industry.\nGoing back to Godzilla, by Americanizing the original source material, it \nalmost sends the message that the Asian aspect of the film \"wasn't worth \nrepresenting\", whilst creating no opportunity to showcase Asian talent. It \nonly furthers an idea that only Western culture can showcase strong box \noffice numbers and is therefore worth showcasing.\n\nI hope all of this made sense.....\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12wezvysuasv3erp04cfxhg1yyojp3a04k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQhHEKjPS3xy_hqTUhW6TPg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uroDqW-HEg8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAuA/wBwX7ASYTec/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.408450704225352, "authorDisplayName": "Quillz06", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T05:15:24.754Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQhHEKjPS3xy_hqTUhW6TPg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.45405600000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T05:15:24.754Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101778704360626069224", "textDisplay": "I'm seeing this movie because I fucking love Godzilla.

In this \ncase I think it was a good decision as Kingsley did a great job but also \nthe movie was about telling that cultures story and bringing it to the West \nto an audience that may have held some of those antiquated racist beliefs. \nAnother example of using white characters to tell another cultures story is \nthe TV show The Wire, that uses the white character McNulty to be the lead \nbut the cleverly let's go of him once it introduces the majority black cast \nas a way of making it accessible to a white audience.

The first two big parts of the film take place in Japan. Probably a \ngood twenty minutes worth of movie is in Japan. For the most part, the \nmovie takes place with the monster as it makes it's way to the city of San \nFrancisco. The reason why they aren't staying in Japan is because the \ndirector, along with pretty much everyone working on the film, believe that \nsomething like this would be a global thing, not just limited to a monster \nbash in Tokyo. If a giant creature, capable of getting around the globe \neasily, has been \"awakened\" for more than 60 years, do you honestly think \nthat it would just stick around Japan? I don't think that it would. An \ninterview with Patrick Sabongui revealed that these creatures are a global \nthing, and that they can get around pretty fast. Not to mention that the \nSan Francisco scenes have been quite obvious. You've got the Golden Gate \nBridge, you've got posters, you've got the trailers practically shoving San \nFrancisco setting down your throat.\n\nThere is another Asian actor in the movie. His role has been kept under \nwraps though. It's one of the best kept secrets about this movie.\n\nIf you noticed that the movie starts off in Japan, and ends in the United \nStates. It's sort of what the intention was. It was sort of a thing that \nvisually shows Godzilla's journey to the United States (from Toho to \nLegendary; Japan to the States). Interesting? I think so.\n\nThe Brody's, the family that is (or was) made up of the characters \nportrayed by Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, and Aaron Taylor Johnson, \nlive in Japan. They aren't just there because Japan had a problem with \ntheir nuclear reactors and they're brought in. A lot of the viral marketing \nsuggests that Cranston and Binoche's characters just happen to work at the \nJanjira plant and are good at what they do. Just because they're white \npeople in Japan, doesn't mean that they're just there because they're \nexperts or tourists. There are white people that live in Japan. Cranston \nand Binoche are probably just people that are good at what they do. You \nkind of have to be an expert to work at a nuclear power plant. It's not \nlike it's a summer job for a fourteen year old looking to make an extra \nbuck.\n\nAnd not to come across as rude, but saying that people who have been \nfollowing this movie very closely since before it was going to be an \nAmerican movie, (2007ish is when Yoshimitsu Banno acquired the rights to \nmake a 40 minute sequel to his movie Godzilla vs Hedorah (or Godzilla vs \nThe Smog Monster) is a bit insulting to those that have invested quite a \nbit of time into following the movie. The reason why the movie seems to be \nfollowing white people is because the movie is centered around Aaron Taylor \nJohnson's character, Ford Brody, who is an EOD specialist in the Navy while \nhe tries to bring his family back together.  Aaron Taylor Johnson is white. \nHas Aaron Taylor Johnson been marketed much? No. For the very same reason \nthat Ken Watanabe hasn't. The marketing team feels that Bryan Cranston is \ngoing to be the one to steal the show. Even with Johnson being the lead \nactor, everyone feels that Cranston is going to steal the show anyways.\n\nAnd not to sound horrible, but how many asian-american actors are actually \nin demand (actual question, as it doesn't seem like many are) that aren't \nalready committed to a project?\n\nGodzilla was never about Japan. In all seriousness, Godzilla was never \nabout Japan. It doesn't matter where Godzilla attacks, what the monster is \ndoing. The one thing that Godzilla was about was the idea of nuclear \nholocaust (at least in the more serious movies). I think that's why a lot \nof people don't care about the whole race thing. It's not because it's what \nwe want, it's because we know that the ethnicity of the people are \ncompletely irrelevant to what the monster itself stands for. The reason \npeople were upset over the change of Johnny Storm's race change (as far as \nI'm aware of) is because Sue Storm wasn't changed as well. They're blood \nsiblings, why wouldn't they be the same race?\n\nAnd the thing about Godzilla's characters... They're rarely the same from \nmovie to movie. One movie could be following a young reporter that helps a \nscientist lure Godzilla into a volcano and the next one be about a trio \nconsisting of a soldier, scientist, and some chick with plot convenient ESP \nas they try to make up their minds about how to kill Godzilla. The \ncharacters are rarely consistent from film to film. All of the characters \nin the movies are hard to care about. The only human character worth \nmentioning is Daisuke Serizawa, the man who killed Godzilla in the first \nmovie with his brand new invention that he was forced to weaponize. \nEveryone else is pretty much Guy With Camera, Guy With Annoying Voice, Girl \nWith Convenient Powers, Annoying Kid #1, Annoying Kid #2, Running Woman \n#764, Kid Who Keeps Tripping, Kumi Mitzuno, Alien Douchebag, Annoying \nBusiness Man, Guy Who Was Blasted Away By Godzilla, Man Who Kidnapped the \nTwin Fairies... etc. These people have names that are easy to forget. \nNobody cares about the human characters in Toho's movies for the most part. \nI'm sure that someone here can easily list off all of the names of the \nmonsters though. And the monsters are not Japanese, they're animals and \ncreatures that fight with other creatures.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13vvjsgov3ah50ez22ocjzaynzeelrth": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-oqyv5jNu1yqZhn7Ym_04w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ElSijo100", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T14:08:13.864Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-oqyv5jNu1yqZhn7Ym_04w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.35170799999999997, "formal_score": 24, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T14:08:13.864Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105434693783240741482", "textDisplay": "This looks like just another version of the first American Godzilla movie- \nmaybe closer to the spirit of the Japanese ones, but still one wonders, \nwhat's the point?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmZqp9hhwXqxFPNAeGtwcQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Darryl \u201cdzilla\u201d baker", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13vvjsgov3ah50ez22ocjzaynzeelrth", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-10T20:59:25.792Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJmZqp9hhwXqxFPNAeGtwcQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99889607899999999, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-10T20:59:25.792Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_StOKLtftVs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD-w/dtDGCkuOJ1g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107914613180691042082", "textDisplay": "another seat fro me !!"}}]}, "z13mgdf5ota4dbmbn04cdpwgkprihbyrvo40k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yOCTxaDXPDIi9E79hTFuQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MBLthdzyE2Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEE/JZHzkXLdDQg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kingfab31", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T11:10:48.303Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1yOCTxaDXPDIi9E79hTFuQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.29962599999999995, "formal_score": 90, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T11:10:48.303Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101236881057143212935", "textDisplay": "Now y'all now what blacks go thru with movies and historical events. \n#WHITEWASH\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13id35y5q2kwbb5y04cdvyphzz2hzdpnas": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6kDoR35SebHw4Ye86QmEzQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mistaa Spaakles", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-13T18:08:32.197Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6kDoR35SebHw4Ye86QmEzQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.26570800000000006, "formal_score": 8, "updatedAt": "2014-04-13T18:08:32.197Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109230536387440491096", "textDisplay": "Look the reason why there aren't many Asians in this movie is after sixty \nyears of being curb stomped by godzilla, they developed a godzilla danger \nsense and high tailed out of those city before he got there.

Toho has \nsought an American made Godzilla movie for quite some time now. They were \nvery dissapointed with the 1998 film. So much so that they fought in court \nto have the name Godzilla removed from the Kaiju used in the 1998 film. \nYes, the film is still called Godzilla, but the monster in that film no \nlonger carries that name.\n\nAfter Gareth Edwards made the movie \"Monsters\" (a fantastic film imo that \nhas great commentary on the silly xenophobia people have towards immigrants \nand immigration in general) in 2010, Toho approached an American movie \ncompany once again to make a yet another Godzilla remake. They wanted \nEdwards (a British director btw) to direct/helm the film and keep it as \nclose as possible to the original Godzilla as possible. While also \nappealing to a wider and younger audiance.\n\nIf anything, this is a more true and fair remake than the American edit \nreleased in 1955. The one with Raymond Burr. Those who speak of the \n\"Original Godzilla\" are often thinking of that version of the film, not \nknowing that it dramatically altered the original. References to the \nbombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima are removed. Irradiated drinking wells \nare instead simply \"contaminated\". Footage of the aftermath of the atomic \nbombings are removed, as is footage of the crew of the Daigo Fukuryu Maru \nfishing boat that was irradiated by H bomb testing. In the 1954 original, \nGodzilla is simply awoken from sleep by atomic testing in the Pacific, \nirradiated by it, and unable to return to his \"under water cavern\" home \nbecause of it. Not mutated by it as in the 1955 edit.\n\nIn the original, Godzilla was an anti-hero. With radiation burns covering \nhis entire body, he rampaged acrossed a city and killed thousands. Not \nbecause he was a mean monster (as in the 1955 American edit) but because he \nwas hurt, scared, and frankly...had been on this planet long before any of \nus. Who were we to build our cities on his home? He was sympathetic. Which \nis why when Dr. Serizawa killed Godzilla with the Oxygen Destroyer, it was \nmore sad than joyous. (It is worth mentioning that Dr Serizawa is in the \n2014 film, and to be played by Ken Watanabe.)\n\nGareth Edwards has said, he wants Godzilla to be an anti-hero in this film. \nNot a mean, destroy everything monster. That, in of itself, makes this a \nworthy adaptation of the 1954 original.\n\nIs it odd that this film doesn't take place only in Japan? Yes, maybe a \nbit. Is it racist that not all of the main characters are Japanese? I \nsuppose it could be interpreted that way. It saddens me that it is being \ndone so by some. Godzilla transcends race and creed at this point. He's a \nworldwide phenomenon that appeals to more than just Japan. As a 4 year old \nboy, I was able to relate to the people of Japan and the monster itself \neven though they were Japanese.\n\nThe original message of the film (Godzilla being a metaphore for the atomic \nbomb) is not entirely lost on today's public, but it doesn't carry the same \nweight that it once did. Not even in Japan. Part of that is Toho's fault \nfor gearing Godzilla more towards children as it went on. It is my hope, as \na Godzilla fan, that this adaptation captures some of that original \nmagic/message. Nature is beyond our control, and will not be tamed. As a \nfunctioning G-fan (I get out of my mom's basement from time to time ;) jk) \nI then submit that this film will, at the very least, be a better and more \nworthy adaptation/remake than the 1955 American edit or the 1998 debacle.\n\nI hope you took the time to read my rant and again I appreciate your work. \nMuch love and good luck to you.\n\nA Texas G-fan.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuzR09glXLC0H7xaxBZ7I3g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "dru_irkins", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z131gnfhpqmht3y4z04cg30ovnnoc5x5jsc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-11T01:02:13.148Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuzR09glXLC0H7xaxBZ7I3g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.98512801000000005, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-11T01:02:13.148Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dA-dxv4DA0s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/QQ3ksjELycw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110846912645500305132", "textDisplay": "Wow, that comment is really awesome!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGEG9JHRh_MY_53U_x7IPQg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "phoenixflier25", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z131gnfhpqmht3y4z04cg30ovnnoc5x5jsc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T16:35:36.042Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGEG9JHRh_MY_53U_x7IPQg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.9072503999999999, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T16:35:36.042Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101145954283867591577", "textDisplay": "A wonderful, factual, well thought response! :D"}}]}, "z12otv5jslvbihc4x04ccb5pooqqcnsyzvg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt7LLfQKfpPnWm7K0Z5jyKQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U91b7IVabn8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARI/YzIHFXIfJEI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.99009900990099009, "authorDisplayName": "chinesevideomaker", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T22:53:05.289Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCt7LLfQKfpPnWm7K0Z5jyKQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.289906, "formal_score": 10, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T22:53:05.289Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111093426323131849457", "textDisplay": "Hi Grace Ik you get a lot of shit and it's understandable why u thought it \nwas in Japan abd you wanted it IN Japan but you must understand that \nserious g fans really get offended when people get it wrong so just \nremember do as much research as possible. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13xhlvrlnf5wxcwy04cetpz1ti3t1jjdu00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWhHtgzEPS5TVWbc32-AhTA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KBp9V5scQkQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAk/r4i4mjn15ew/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "flickchic24", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-09T02:36:54.439Z", "videoId": "-smN3OeXD_E", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCWhHtgzEPS5TVWbc32-AhTA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.15768200000000004, "formal_score": 7, "updatedAt": "2014-04-09T02:36:54.439Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105213761110689634808", "textDisplay": "Thank You Grace I really admire and respect that you are addressing it.

I always wait for the movie and \njudge afterwards, but I like everyone's thoughts and ideas."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAXR2zenCwvRIyQd9ydtfaA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Beyond The Trailer", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12cwzhictasxbvto22bwlthjl3mvfqad04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T19:55:20.221Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAXR2zenCwvRIyQd9ydtfaA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.88403149999999997, "formal_score": 91, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T19:55:20.221Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nrHLKGtrL1g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC4/XgF5Z6f4Mrc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110119621219369889023", "textDisplay": "+Madara Uchiha Thanks for the support, Madara, and being honest regardless \nif you agree with me or not. :)\n- Grace"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNVFbxcfptAEN_Srz_yJK2Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Madara Uchiha", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12cwzhictasxbvto22bwlthjl3mvfqad04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T19:53:01.128Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNVFbxcfptAEN_Srz_yJK2Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.22300399999999998, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T19:53:01.128Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KlqOmNrmNAQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFM/o8GstViKln0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113318232356919889646", "textDisplay": "@__@ Mangekyo Sharingan i'm a huge fan of Grace i'm just pointing out that \nneeds to be pointed out, and so far, I now know why she said that, but what \nim seeing right now is okay....We just raged in her last review because she \nhas a large following, and some might not see it because grace for the most \npart, gave it negative thoughts, I knew it was just thoughts, and stuff, \nbut others might think it's all legit, and might not see the film, because \nofit."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe7KIGUhNb9E2KIEUccD6Kg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "r0gamer94", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12cwzhictasxbvto22bwlthjl3mvfqad04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-08T19:49:37.302Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCe7KIGUhNb9E2KIEUccD6Kg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.27258800000000005, "formal_score": 49, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-08T19:49:37.302Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113705873230018702507", "textDisplay": "+Beyond The Trailer You expect Madara to be open minded lol.
