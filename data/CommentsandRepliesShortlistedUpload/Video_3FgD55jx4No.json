It most likely relates to the inappropriate contact he's had \nwith his teachers as stated by the school. No doubt if this student had \nserious behavioral and disciplinary issues, he would have most likely been \neither expelled, transferred or even arrested. \n\nSecondly it's because of this specific incident that lead to this \naggressive punishment of suspension from the last days of school (which \nwill prevent him from finishing his final classes) after suspected previous \nincidents as well as warnings he failed to heed. Thus he will not be able \nto graduate. Like i said before, this won't be beneficial to both parties \nbecause the student will then have to make up classes in the summer or the \nnext school year in most likely the same school around the same teachers \nand administrators agitated by his touchy feely behavior. \n\n\nMuch longer then they would have had to deal with this student if instead \nhe were isolated with different teachers, took mandatory classes on proper \ncontact and etiquette and do community service. This way the student would \nget his credits, graduate and be gone from school, far away. The student \nhas the right to defend himself and his actions by being allow to tell his \nside of the story even the video evidence plus his suspected previous \nincidents and warnings are damning.\n\n\nFinally, you're entitled to your's by all mean's but in my opinion niglet \nor cracklet is no fair way designate person, i'm just saying."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCY7ncaNn44ysucXaUlzdBQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.82644628099173556, "authorDisplayName": "Cliff Yablonski", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13pfljamye3cngip04cejp45z2ogxl44cc", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-17T13:15:35.930Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCCY7ncaNn44ysucXaUlzdBQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.49755400000000005, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-17T13:15:35.930Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116571224736910502250", "textDisplay": "+kiatiming101 Key words here \"past discipline record and previous \nsuspensions\"....there's a whole shitload more going on here than this \nsingle hug.
