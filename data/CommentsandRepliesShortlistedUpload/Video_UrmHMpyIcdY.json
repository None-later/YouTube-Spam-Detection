Science is observation, testing, and \ndemonstration. If you don't know the answer then shhh!\n\nGOD's creation and many more scriptures:\n- Genesis 1:1\n- Genesis 1:24\n- Hebrews 1:10\n- Colossians 1:16\n\nRomans 1:18-22\nGod\u2019s Wrath Against Sinful Humanity\n18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the \ngodlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their \nwickedness, 19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because \nGod has made it plain to them. 20 For since the creation of the world God\u2019s \ninvisible qualities\u2014his eternal power and divine nature\u2014have been clearly \nseen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without \nexcuse.\n21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave \nthanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts \nwere darkened. 22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools\n\n^^ Everyone is without excuse before judgement day. Non-believers who read \nthis will be accountable to their own action. There are no excuses.\n\nPEACE!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsLdL8k9gMatVzwXq339g1Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Joe Johnson", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z131y1nzeviehjek223ey3iz2ln3yj0jl04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-07T03:09:27.080Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCsLdL8k9gMatVzwXq339g1Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.60857199999999989, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-07T03:09:27.080Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102401291136847684236", "textDisplay": "+TheOpinionater This is not a religious debate.

(it was also pretty much \nproven last week due to them finding the gravitational waves). But to kent \nhovinds slaves, they would not know it was an expansion because they trust \nmr hovind and he tells them it was an explosion...\n\nanother is, \"from nothing to everything\". the big bang theory is not the \nbeginning of everything. It is not explaining the origin of the universe. \nIt was not from nothing to everything.\n\nAnother: Kent hovind says we don't know if the animals gave birth so it \ncan't be evidence for evolution. That is a HUGE misunderstanding of \nevolution. Individuals do not evolve, populations do over time. If there \nwas 1, there were more just like it. He also says we don't know if it had \nkids, and we especially don't know if it had \"different\" kids. He makes it \nsound like he thinks evolution says dogs give birth to non dogs for \nexample..... THAT IS NOT EVOLUTION!! In the history of life, every animal \nhas gave birth to to the species of which the parents are. Evolution does \nnot state a dog gave birth to a cow.

Redefine terms to \nsuit your agenda and *hesto-presto*, your world is *the* world.\n\nReligion doesn't require gods?? What planet are you referring to?\n\n\"If you can't prove it scientifically, it is a religious belief.\" Religion \nand science are two entirely separate fields, with entirely separate goals \nand methods. \n\nThis is (my opinion) an excellent case of psychological projection. When \nyou believe in the supernatural, which takes faith (pretending to know what \nyou really don't know), there is immediately a part of your brain (the \nreasoning, thinking part) which says, \"Stop being an idiot. Stop pretending \nto know what you really don't know. It's absurd. You're fooling yourself. \nIf you don't know for certain, say so. If the only legitimate reason you \nhave for believing in something is because you want to believe it, just say \nso.\".\n\nIsn't cognitive dissonance a bitch? Enter psychological projection.

I really can't \nsee any Roman soldiers going through all the trouble of putting a guy up on \na cross just to let him down the same day. The standard procedure was to \nleave the body to rot up there as a kind of gruesome billboard not to fuck \nwith Rome. So much so that I find it harder to believe they would undo all \nthat work (supposedly out of respect for the Jewish holidays (like they \ncared at all)) than to believe anyone rose from the dead. They would sooner \nhave just cut his throat or bashed his head in and tossed him in a ditch.\n\nLuke 24:15 While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached \nand began traveling with them. 16 But their eyes were prevented from \nrecognizing Him.\nhahahaha\n\nMark 16:12 After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them while \nthey were walking along on their way to the country. 13 They went away and \nreported it to the others, but they did not believe them either.\nLOL appeared in a different form. I can't stop laughing.\n\nMatthew 28:16 But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the \nmountain which Jesus had designated. 17 When they saw Him, they worshiped \nHim; but some were doubtful.\n\n(Why were they doubtful? Was this not Jesus whom they had spent the last 3 \nyears? Doesn't it seem more like there was someone claiming the spirit of \nJesus had risen up in him, possessed him to talk through him so that he \ncould take the place of and have the attention that Jesus had? Some \nbelieved and others didn't.)\n\n*\"in your world view there is a possibility that God exists so that means \nyou are at risk when you take your last breath\"*\n    Choosing to not be uncritical of the utter lack of evidence for god is \nnot optional. I can only take it as I perceive it, & know that if I were in \ngod's position I'd never condemn people for not being gullible. You have to \nknow WHO you are relating to & in order to do that it helps just a little \nto have some assurance that this WHO exists. Anything else quite frankly \ncouldn't lead to anything but a shallow relationship. Pathetic!!!\n    Pascal's Wager = It's better to make assumptions about god than risk \neternal torture in his basement.\n    But if it turns out that the one true god is one that hates people \nfraking their gift of reason & being gullible to a fault & wasting their \none life on a toss up (Pascals wager), then you are so screwed...\n    Homer Simpson's version of Pascal's wager \"Don't pray to *any* god \nbecause if you're praying to the wrong god, then you're just pissin' off \nthe real one.\"\n    Pascals Wager, one of the most compelling reasons to avoid all gods. \nThe frequency which is brought up among the faithful indicates more about \nthe nature of god's relationship with man than all the bibles in the world. \nWhy worship a god that keeps itself so distant that folks are reduced to \nthe roll of a 10,000 sided die regarding their fate? Why is gullibility so \ncherished?

This is not a criticism. (sorry but \ntrolls will be ignored)\n\nReasoned argument 1/...There are 12 star signs that reliably dictate your \n'core / general' personality character traits at birth. Once the alignments \nof the planetary positions are calculated at time and location of birth, \nacute personality traits are reliably and consistently determined to an \nincredibly accurate degree. That's as intangible as any other mystical \nphenomenon, yet it's ignored and palmed off as hogwash. (for evidence test \nit yourself).\n2/ Evolution & mutation is only a process, with limits.

No mutation is possible with out genetic DNA \ninstructions of coded information that supports it in the first place. \nWhere did organisms of molecular intelligence originate? Evolution explains \nnothing, except the concept of evolution, with its astonishing design.

Once you control mainstream media you control \neverything society reads, hears, see's and thinks.

Prior studies have not addressed whether prayer itself or \nknowledge/certainty that prayer is being provided may influence outcome. We \nevaluated whether (1) receiving intercessory prayer or (2) being certain of \nreceiving intercessory prayer was associated with uncomplicated recovery \nafter coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\nMethods\nPatients at 6 US hospitals were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: 604 \nreceived intercessory prayer after being informed that they may or may not \nreceive prayer; 597 did not receive intercessory prayer also after being \ninformed that they may or may not receive prayer; and 601 received \nintercessory prayer after being informed they would receive prayer. \nIntercessory prayer was provided for 14 days, starting the night before \nCABG. The primary outcome was presence of any complication within 30 days \nof CABG. Secondary outcomes were any major event and mortality.\nResults\nIn the 2 groups uncertain about receiving intercessory prayer, \ncomplications occurred in 52% (315/604) of patients who received \nintercessory prayer versus 51% (304/597) of those who did not (relative \nrisk 1.02, 95% CI 0.92-1.15). Complications occurred in 59% (352/601) of \npatients certain of receiving intercessory prayer compared with the 52% \n(315/604) of those uncertain of receiving intercessory prayer (relative \nrisk 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.28). Major events and 30-day mortality were \nsimilar across the 3 groups.\nConclusions\nIntercessory prayer itself had no effect on complication-free recovery from \nCABG, but *certainty of receiving intercessory prayer was associated with a \nHIGHER INCIDENCE of complications.*"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMrgSiWX0PrfLc-OpliS_Kg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ExtantFrodo2", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12lcfaghkvhijpcm23icvignneuixayt04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-14T14:00:47.788Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMrgSiWX0PrfLc-OpliS_Kg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.79797600000000002, "formal_score": 89, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-14T14:00:47.788Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DwY01DOJUU4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADY/lGxvvkPG7A0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110131025521134519001", "textDisplay": "+Niwa HEK\nThe test was serious and done scientifically.

Had the situation actually turned into \nthe mob receiving his daughters then you may have proof, but I say things \nall the time to make a point.  I think allot of people do.

If \nyou believed in Jesus and understood that God has been proving to us humans \n\"always\" what he has in store for us, \"even women\" you may be closer to \nseeing a loving God.   God made women to be loved and cherished.  You can't \nblame peoples actions on God.  Even if they falsely claim to be working in \nthe name of God  He would never put women in harm by demanding they die or \nbe stoned to death in his behalf.

Looking at the world around us, is it a \ncrime to search out more than what our minds can come up with.  going \noutside ourselves makes us feel we are loosing control over our lives, when \nit could just make us see Gods true Love.

So I\u2019ll start with the title.  This is not a debate.  This \nvideo consists of selected clips taken from both the Big Think and Mr. \nHovind\u2019s seminars.  Mr. Hovind isn\u2019t presenting any scientific hypothesis \nto counter the theory of evolution.  He\u2019s doing what so many creationists \ndo best; using propaganda and rhetoric to distort the facts.  He frequently \nquote mines and uses misleading or frankly wrong data to support his claims.\n\nIn the description of the video it states Mr. Hovind is currently in prison \nfor teaching about his ideas.  This is completely false.  He is in jail for \ntax fraud.  The first amendment guarantees he has the right to speak, or \npreach, about whatever he choses, regardless of the accuracy of his \nteachings.\n\nNow for the worst atrocities of this video, his utter lack of understanding \nof scientific principals.  Starting at 0:14 and continuing for several \nminutes Mr. Hovind makes several inaccurate statements concerning our \ncurrent understanding of the formation of the universe and the development \nof life on earth.   The big bang was not an explosion from nothing as he \nstates.  It was a rapid expansion of the universe from a very dense state. \n All of the matter and energy that composes the universe, as we know it was \ncontained in a single point called a singularity.  This is not as Hovind \nstates, \u201cNothing exploded and produced everything.\u201d  Additionally he \nremarks that rain on the rocky crust, created a soup that eventually formed \nlife and slowly evolved to everything we see today.  No scientist believes \nthat life formed and evolved in this manner.  We really do not know how \nlife emerged on this planet, nor do we fully understand the origins of the \nuniverse, which brings me to my next point.\n\nStarting at 1:17 he states he asked a professor where everything came from \nand the professor said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d  He continues on in this manner for \nseveral minutes.  This is the same tactic that many creationist use; \nbecause not every aspect of a theory is understood\u2026it must be false.  This \ncouldn\u2019t be further from the truth.  There are many theories and scientific \nprinciples that are poorly understood yet we know they are true.  There are \ngaps in our knowledge in every branch of science.  Science doesn\u2019t claim to \nknow everything, cannot know everything and will never know everything.  We \ndon\u2019t know everything about the theory of gravity, yet we know it\u2019s there \nand you will feel the effects if you jump off the Empire State Building. \n Doctors do not completely understand how many medications work, yet they \nknow the drugs are effective and continue using them to treat patients. \n\nAt 2:12 Hovind asks why two planets spin backwards.  We have a clear \nunderstanding of why some planetary bodies rotate in different directions \nthan the other planets.  There are many reasons a planet my change it\u2019s \ndirection of rotation.  It\u2019s poles could flip, tidal forces from the sun \nand other planets may slow and eventually reverse the rotation of the \nplanet, or they could have been struck by a large object which we know has \nhappened to several planets early in their lives, including our own.  Just \nbecause the stated professor didn\u2019t know the answers to these questions, \ndoesn\u2019t mean that our current model for the creation of the universe or \nplanetary evolution is wrong, nor does it prove that the universe was \ncreated by a \u201cgod\u201d.\n\n4:48  There are still monkeys because humans did not evolve from monkeys. \n Humans and great apes evolved from a common ancestor.  \n\n4:59 Claiming there is no fossil record of the evolution of humans from a \ncommon ancestor of apes is a common tactic for creationist.  This is \ncompletely false.  There has been hundreds of fossils found that are \nconsidered to be \u201cintermediate\u201d or transitional forms of early hominids: \nsivipithicus, australopithicus, homo habilis, and homo erectus to name a \nfew.\n\n6:24 Hovind gives an incredibly poor analogy of carbon dating with a \nburning candle.   This demonstrates his utter lack of knowledge of nuclear \ndecay.  Carbon 14 decays at a constant rate.   This is a constant, not a \nvariable as he states.  Since this decay is constant and we know what the \nabundance of C14 is in living creatures we can very accurately calculate \nthe age of the specimen.  He gives examples of errors in radiometric dating \nand even, thankfully, gives citations.  If you look up the references he \nquotes, he\u2019s taking the data out of context.  In two of the examples given \nthe articles state that factors in the environment decreased the amount of \nC14 in the specimens.  This does little to decrease the validity of the \ntesting method.  What Hovind fails to explain is all forms of testing have \ninaccuracies and environmental factors that can alter the results.  That is \nwhy scientist use statics to determine a confidence interval and whether \ndata is statistically significant.  C14 dating passes these tests almost \nall the time and when there is erroneous data it usually can be accounted \nfor and the data adjusted as need.  Hovind shows only a few cases where C14 \ngave false results; however, there are thousands of cases where C14 was \ntested, compared to a know control, and shown to be accurate.\n\n7:41, the appendix is a vestigial organ.  It is of lymphoid origin and \nprobably had a function at one point in human evolution; likely to protect \nagainst GI infections.  Today, patient\u2019s who have their appendix removed \nhave absolutely no increase in the amount of infections.\n\n9:04, Natural selection will not cause one species to turn into another \nspecies as his \u201ccar into plane\u201d analogy states.  Natural selection allows \nbiologic traits to become more or less prominent in a population based on \nthe advantage or disadvantage imparted by the trait.  Organisms with \nbiologic traits that impart an advantage are more likely to compete for \nfood, and mates, and therefore survive to propagate, passing on this \nadvantageous trait to the next generation.  Organisms with traits that are \nless advantageous may not be fit enough to compete and therefore may not \nsurvive to mate and pass on their genetic traits.\n\n9:48, This is an ad homenim fallacy, so what, Earnest Haeckel was a fraud; \nthat does nothing to change the validity of evolutionary science or \nembryology.  He continues with an appeal to emotion fallacy by drawing the \nparallel to errors in textbooks with Nazi fascism.  \n\n12:06, This is speculation by a journalist, satirist and philosopher, not a \nscientist.  Plus, from his quote, he clearly doesn\u2019t know the difference \nbetween a hypothesis and a theory.  As our scientific knowledge increases, \nevolution continues to stand up to all scrutiny.   Some our most astounding \nbiologic discoveries since Darwin published the Origin of Species, such as \nMendelian genetics and DNA, have not only supported the theory; but have \nhelped to explain some of the mechanics of how the process works.\n\nScientific theories are well-substantiated explanations for natural \nphenomenon, which are falsifiable, and based on facts that have been tested \nby repeatable observations and experiments.  Dogma is an ideology laid down \nby an authority as incontrovertible truth.  Creationism (intelligent \ndesign) is dogma because it is not a well-substantiated explanation for \nnatural phenomenon, which has been tested; it is instead an ideology laid \ndown by evangelists and ministers as incontrovertible truth.  \n\nUltimately Mr. Hovind, like so many creationists, is not a scientist and \nhas very poor knowledge of physics, chemistry and evolutionary biology.

Disregarding his fraud (which is *lying* \nabout your taxes), why don't we look at his arguments against \nEvolution/Nebular Hypothesis/Big Bang. This is one his arguments, clearly \nshowing he's either stupid or lying. \n*Kent Hovind: The Moon is receding a few inches each year. Less than a \nmillion years ago the Moon would have been so close that the tides would \nhave drowned everyone twice a day. Less than 2 or 3 million years ago the \nMoon would have been inside the Roche limit and, thus, destroyed.*\n(Dr. Hilpman vs. Dr. Hovind, June 15, 1992; the Royal Hall of the \nUniversity of Missouri)\nLet us assume, for the sake of argument, that the Moon is receding at 6 \ninches per year. If we go back a million years, then the Moon was 6 million \ninches closer to the earth. That comes to about 95 miles! Since the Moon is \nabout 240,000 miles away, that doesn't amount to diddly-squat! Indeed, the \nMoon has a slightly elliptical orbit that varies more than 95 miles all by \nitself. The distance between Earth and Moon oscillates twelve times per \nyear between 405,400km at Apogee, and 362,600km at Perigee. That is about \n40,000km difference. So 95 miles, which is 152km, isn't going to drown us \ntwice per day. If 40,000km isn't doing it, 152km isn't doing it either. \nSo, either Hovind is stupid and can't even do Math 101, or he knew it and \nlied all the same. He clearly said a *few* inches, look up the debate, it's \non YouTube and he says it in the first minutes. Not even if it moved away \nat a rate of 50 inches it wouldn't have drowned us a million years ago. But \n50 inches isn't *a few inches*. That's actually a pretty large number. \nThat's actually a few dozen inches.

messed up or didnt have the right stuff or things to do it \nright or whatever how do you know they will ever have the answer? \n\nand read exactly what you said. \"Randy if we have 80% then this mean's that \nit's most likely to be true\" yea your right on that theres a good chance \nyou could be right okay however theres a small chance your completely wrong \ntoo. do you agree with that? and if you do then that means even at 99.9 \npercent there is still a .1 percent chance your still wrong. \n\nand taking a test is not a good metaphor or example of that lol cause a \ntest is a list of things you should know but what happens if you didnt \nstudy or they put something int here you didnt even learn yet? that doesn't \nmake the other answer you had wrong if you got those right and 2 wrong \nbecause you know those  questions so basically what im saying is this is \nnot even close to the same as what im saying lol its the worst analogy ever \nhonestly lol"}}]},

Actually if you spent as much time looking into the truth of \nradiometric dating as you do calling people names...maybe you will find how \nit's based on \"wrong assumptions\"!\n\nRadiometric dating is a much misunderstood phenomenon. Evolutionists often \nmisunderstand the method, assuming it gives a definite age for tested \nsamples. Creationists also often misunderstand it, claiming that the \nprocess is inaccurate.\nRadiometric Dating Is Not Inaccurate\nPerhaps a good place to start this article would be to affirm that \nradiometric dating is not inaccurate. It is certainly incorrect, and it is \ncertainly based on wrong assumptions, but it is not inaccurate.\n\nWhat do I mean? How can something be accurate and yet wrong? To understand \nthis point, we need to understand what exactly is being measured during a \nradiometric dating test. One thing that is not being directly measured is \nthe actual age of the sample.\nNo \u201cAge-Meter\u201d\n\nThere is no \u201cage-meter\u201d that you can plug into a rock, giving an immediate \nread-out of the rock\u2019s age. It needs to be remembered that observational \nscience can only measure things in the here-and-now, in a manner which can \nbe repeated. Historical science is concerned with trying to work out what \nmay have happened in a one-off event in the past. Historical science is not \ncapable of repetition, checking or peer\u2014\u02dcreview. The age of a rock sample \nfalls under the heading of historical science, not observational science. \nSo what do the observational scientists in the radiometric dating lab do?\n\nRadioactive isotopes are unstable and will decay into more stable isotopes \nof other elements. One common radiometric dating method is the Uranium-Lead \nmethod. This involves uranium isotopes with an atomic mass of 238. This is \nthe most common form of uranium. It decays by a 14-step process into \nlead-206, which is stable. Each step involves the elimination of either an \nalpha or a beta particle.\n\nTherefore the process is:\nUranium Decay Equation\nEach individual atom has a chance of decaying by this process. If you were \nable to examine just one atom, you would not know whether or not it would \ndecay. The chance of it decaying is not definite, by human standards, and \nis similar to the chance of rolling a particular number on a dice. Although \nwe cannot determine what will happen to an individual atom, we can \ndetermine what will happen to a few million atoms. This is similar to our \ndice analogy.\n\nWe cannot tell what number we will roll in any one shake, but if we rolled \n6,000 dice, the chances are very high that 1,000 of them would have landed \non a six. One dice is unpredictable. Many dice follow a statistically \npredictable pattern. In the same way, one U-238 atom is unpredictable, but \na sample containing many millions of U-238 atoms will be very predictable.\n\nWhat happens statistically is that half of the available atoms will have \ndecayed in a given period, specific to each radioactive species, called the \nhalf-life. For example, if element Aa had a half-life of 1 day and we had \n1,000 lbs. of it on Monday, then we would have 500 lbs. on Tuesday, 250 \nlbs. (half of 500) on Wednesday and 125 lbs. on Thursday.\n\nDetermining Half-Life\nBy observing how fast U-238 decays into lead-206, we can calculate the \nhalf-life of U-238. This is a theoretical calculation, and we can therefore \ndetermine that the half-life of U-238 is 4.5 billion years. Remember that \nthe half-life is a statistical measure. Granting that U-238 has a half-life \nof 4.5 billion years in no way negates the idea that the Earth is only \n6,000 years old.\n\nA very common rock that contains U-238 is granite. If we look at some of \nthe very small zircon crystals in granite, we can accurately measure how \nmuch U-238 and Pb-206 the crystal contains. In order to calculate the age \nof the rock, we need three other pieces of information:\n\nWe need to know how fast the U-238 turns into Pb-206. The half-life gives \nus this value, provided the half-life has never altered during the lifetime \nof the zircon crystal.\nWe need to know how much Pb-206 there was in the original rock. This is \nclearly impossible. It is usually assumed, without justification, that the \noriginal quantity of Pb-206 in the rock was zero.\n\nWe need to be sure that no lead compounds have been added to or taken away \nfrom the rock. Given that lead compounds are fairly soluble in water, this \nis something that we cannot be very sure of.\nUsing the above assumptions, it is calculated that the zircon crystals have \nan age of about 1.5 billion years.\n\nBased Upon Assumptions\nThe radioactive decay process above can be seen to produce 8 \nalpha-particles for each one atom of U-238. Each \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b1-particle could gain \nnew electrons and become an atom of helium. The rate of diffusion of helium \nfrom a zircon crustal can be measured. It turns out that this rate of \ndiffusion of helium is compatible with the crystals being about 5,000 years \nold, not 1.5 billion years old. Although assumptions 2 and 3 are not \nprovable, they actually seem very likely in this particular example. \nTherefore, it seems that the first assumption must be wrong1.\n\nRemember that we have already said that these experimenters are highly \nskilled. It is therefore unlikely that the laboratory technicians have made \na mistake in their measurements of U-238 or Pb-206. The only possible \nconclusion, therefore, is that the half-life of U-238 has not been constant \nthroughout the lifetime of the granite and its zircon crystals.\n\nThere is more information here...\nhttps://answersingenesis.org/geology/radiometric-dating/radiometric-dating-problems-with-the-assumptions/\n\nSo El Coyote...as you can see the whole system/method is totally based on \nwrong assumptions!\n\nYou are free to believe whatever you like...I choose to believe God's word \nin the bible. Perhaps if you were to read the bible you will also find out \nthat \"Evil-ution\" is absolutely false...and therefore you will realize the \ndebate is over with radiometric dating realizing it's totally unreliable \nsince it's based on totally wrong assumptions!\n\nI do hope God opens your eyes and your heart to His truth. This is all I \nhave to say to you...may God bless you El Coyote...good bye!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBtNhwrw_wsSVlXz92vUXhw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0,

The same bones over \nand over, in different proportions. Knowing just a little about morphology \nis powerful evidence for evolution. \n\n\"Why is there still monkeys?\" This question fails on so many levels. #1 \nsimple logic. Things come from other things and we still have those things. \nAmericans come from Europeans. We still have Europeans. If we came from \ndust, why is there still dust? #2 It's a misunderstanding of science. We \ndidn't come from monkeys. We didn't even come from apes. Not directly. We \nshare a common ancestor. #3 the animals that were our progenitors are \nextinct so we don't have the original \"monkeys\".\n \nOkay, first, he's mixing up carbon dating and radiometric dating. Fossils \ndon't have any carbon, 14 or otherwise. Second, of course they've done \nstudies with known age. Some of the first carbon dating studies ever done \nwere on artifacts from Egypt. They had three labs all confirm the date \nwithin a certain margin of error perfectly. \n\nAquatic animals give inaccurate results due to the reservoir effect. This \nis well understood by science.

You will never find one crossing geological layers. \n\nYour appendix might have functions but it's still vestigial. More people \ndied from appendicitis before modern times. It's more dangerous to have \nthen to not. \n\nIt requires energy to produce tails and appendices. If it doesn't provide \nenough evolutionary advantage, it will be lost. \n\nThe car would only become an airplane if there were evolutionary pressures. \nIf it somehow died when it was closer to the ground and only the one's with \nsome ability to get away from the ground \"survived\", it would change. \n\nThose little slits become gills in fish. They have different roles in \nhumans. That is how evolution works. Lungs have nothing to do with gills \nBTW.\n\nIf there's photos too, then who cares.

That's just a lie. \n\nIf he or she doesn't accept evolution he should say so since he or she is \nbeing asked for his or her opinion. In the mean time though, learn the \nmaterial. Maybe if you learn the material you can grow up and disprove \nevolution and win a Nobel prize. You've got to learn it first though. \n\nNow he's getting religious. I don't believe in that either. \n\nAnd there you have it. Everything he said is wrong. If you really want to \nknow, I mean if you really want to understand, you've got to look at all of \nthe evidence. If you just want to believe then fine, just believe. But, if \nyou want to understand, look at the entire body of evidence. Luckily \nsomeone was kind enough to put it in a book for you. Read \"Why Evolution is \nTrue\" by Jerry Coyne.

He actually cited his evidence and it was \nreferring to the formation of a star system.  Incidentally, star systems \ndon't explode when they form so conservation of angular momentum doesn't \napply.\n2) Abiogenesis (that would be scientific exploration of the origin of life) \nnever claims that life came from rocks.  That's a fabrication Mr. Hovind \nmade up to unfairly discredit science. \n3) In an attempt to disprove the scientific evidence of abiogenesis, Mr. \nHovind says that there was too much oxygen on the planet for life to form \nand cites oxygen bubbles formed in amber.  Amber, as is commonly known, is \nformed from tree sap.  Trees, one may expect, came after life began.\n4) He lies about Stephen J. Gould, calling him a \"Marxist professor.\"  \nGould's father was a Marxist, but Stephen had very different beliefs from \nhis father and was not a Marxist.\n5) Speaking of Gould, Mr. Hovind quote-mines Gould, making it seem that he \nsays a lack of transitional fossils is a problem with evolution when Gould \nwas actually saying that the lack of transitional fossils was a problem for \ngradual evolution.  Gould was pointing out that life didn't steadily \nchange, but rather that it surged forward for periods and held steady for \nothers.\n6) He makes the claim that an artificial dam 4000 years ago broke and all \nthe rushing water formed the grand canyon.  Of course, that would mean \nthere would be evidence of the dam such as shaped stone blocks or a quarry \nwhere they originated.\n7) He points out that if the flood was real, there would be layers of dirt \nand that they would separate by the composition.  His example lists gravel, \nsand, silt, and clay.  Of course, the layers are not laid out like that so \nhe's arguing against the flood.\n8) He doesn't understand radiocarbon dating at all or if he does, he lies \nabout it.  He builds a straw man with the line \"We know the Earth is \nmillions of years old because of carbon dating,\" and then proceeds to tear \nit down.  Of course, carbon dating is shown to be only usable to periods of \ntime no more than 75,000 years old so anyone who actually understands \ncarbon dating would never make that claim. \n9) Mr. Hovind mocks science for reexamining the data to come up with more \naccurate numbers.  A specific example is how he points out that science has \nbeen continually correcting its estimates for the age of the Earth from \n70,000 years to 4.6 billion years.  He fails to realize that this is a \nstrength of science, not a weakness. \n10) He lies and emphatically calls Darwin a racist because of the subtitle \nof the Origin of Species: The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle \nfor Life.  If he were to read the book, he would find no references that \none 'race' of people are superior to another.\n\nThese are just a smattering of the twenty-some pages of notes I took on the \nvideo.  Mr. Hovind lies several times, particularly about professors he \nclaims to meet who coincidentally misunderstand science in precisely the \nsame way he does.  He's a prolific quote-miner and most quotes by \nscientists actually say the exact opposite of what he claims.  He tries to \nfrighten people into believing that if they accept science (which he lumps \nin as evolution), they will go to hell.  And he consistently tries to shill \nfor other creationists.  He's the worst kind of snake-oil salesman and the \nworst thing is that people actually believe him. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13xgxw43uqoubd2s22mwxwgtvzovzxpr04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeZV5l0T5sH_q6Y1hn2czEQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GSbl-H5xbc8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/W7vgv0D-aTc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bradley Coffman", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-12T17:37:37.772Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeZV5l0T5sH_q6Y1hn2czEQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.87948000000000004, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2015-02-12T17:37:37.772Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100142358010641239484", "textDisplay": "Hovind is in prison for 12 tax offences and 45 accounts of structuring cash \ntransaction, not for sad attempts at trying to disprove evolution. \nEvolution isn't a religion, you accept it as fact since it is.

(glasses without ear \npieces) \n\nNow, inflate the balloon. Notice the two circles will moving apart the more \nthe ballon is inflated. Yet,  the line connecting the two circles remain \nconnected. That line represents a stretched light beam.\n\nNow let's see what the Bible has to say:\n\nIsaiah 40:22\n\"...He that sitteth upon the circle of the Earth, and the inhabitants \nthereof are as grasshoppers, that stretcheth out the Heavens as a curtain, \nand spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in...\"\n\nHere Isaiah is telling us that the Earth is indeed round...(written about \n700 BC) and that God \"stretched\" the Heavens out like a curtain, that we \nmay swell under it like a tent.\n \nWithin the first 6 days of Creation (Genesis 1-6) , God created light. What \ndo you think happened to that light when God stretched out the Heavens?\n\nThe light from all the stars was already touching the Earth before God \nbegan to  Stretched out the Heavens. \n\nIndeed, the stars maybe in fact be billions of mile way by now. Nobody \nreally knows for sure how far the stars are, since there is no trigonometry \nformula available today that can accurately measure distances further than \n2- lightyears away from Earth. Any distance beyond that are pure \nspeculation.\n\nBut lets just say for illustration purposes, those stars ARE in fact \nbillions of lightyears away.\n\nThat doesn't mean the light from those stars traveled that distance to \nEarth. It could mean that when God stretched the Heavens, he also stretched \nthe starlight along with it. Just like the line between those two small \ncircles on the inflated balloon.\n\nExactly HOW God stretched out the Heavens, I couldn't begin to guess.

Heaven on \nhigh had not been named, nor the earth beneath. Their begetter was Apsu, \nthe father of the primordial Deep, and their mother was *Tiamat*, the \nspirit of Chaos. No plain was yet formed, no marsh could be seen; the gods \nhad no existence, nor had their fates been determined. Then there was a \nmovement in the waters, and the deities issued forth.\"\n\n\n1b)The Epic of Ba'al: Though it lacks an \"in the beginning\", you get this \nsame sense of a primordial ocean from other passages (Via Wiki.)\n\n\"*Lothan* or *Lawtan* is the seven-headed *sea serpent* or *dragon* of \nUgaritic myths. He is either a pet of the god *Yam* or an aspect of Yam \nhimself; the cosmic ocean of myth is often known as a great stream. -- Yam \nis the deity of the primordial chaos and represents the power of the sea, \nuntamed and raging; he is seen as ruling storms and the disasters they \nwreak. The gods cast out Yam from the heavenly mountain after his defeat at \nthe hands of Ba'al, the true storm god.\" < Note the casting out, similar to \nSatan? Who's also a snake thing/dragon? .\n\n1c) Genesis: In the beginning God created the heavens and the\nearth.  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface \nof the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.\n\nThe \u201cdeep\u201d refers to the chaotic waters of the sea, which is used to \ncommunicate the idea of evil and chaos. The word used for \"deep\" is *Tehom*...which \nis rendered elsewhere in the bible as...*Tehomot* to talk about the watery \nabyss. Sound familiar? \n\nThis can really say: Darkness was over the surface (body) of Tiamat...\n\n\"The Hebrew word used for \u201cwater\u201d (mayim) here refers to the life-giving \nwaters for creation.\" -- From a Christian website.\n\n*Section Conclusion*: In all three myths, we see a chaotic, primordial \ncosmic ocean existing independently of planet Earth. In at least two of the \nstories, it's clear that there are two types of water and in the Ba'al \nstory we see at the very least two aspects of the water. A god and a beast \nthat's either a part of it, or something it controls. Either way, we have \nsome duality going on. \n\n\n*Epic Ass Battles Ensue*: \n\n2a) Enuma Elish: \"Merodach uplifted his arm, grasping the dreaded \nthunderstone, and spake unto Tiamat, the *rebellious one*, saying: \"*Thou \nhast exalted thyself*, and with wrathful heart hath *prepared for war \nagainst the high gods and their fathers, whom thou dost hate in thy heart \nof evil.* Unto Kingu thou hast given the power of Anu to decree fate, \nbecause *thou art hostile to what is good and loveth what is sinful.* *Gather \nthy forces together, and arm thyself and come forth to battle.* \n (Basically, just like Satan in Revelation.) \n\n\"Then the lord of the high gods seized his dart and cast it through the \nlower part of her body; it tore her inward parts and severed her heart. So \nwas Tiamat slain.\"\n\n\"He leapt upon the dragon's body; *he clove her skull with his great club*; \nhe opened the channels of her blood which streamed forth, and caused the \nnorth to carry her blood to hidden places.\" -- Being a water dragon, her \n\"blood\" is water.\n\n\"Merodach rested a while, *gazing upon the dead body of the dragon. Then \nthe lord of the high gods split the body of the dragon like that of a \nmashde fish into two halves.* With one half he enveloped the firmament; he \nfixed it there and set a watchman to prevent the waters falling down. With \nthe other half he made the earth.\"\n\nNote: After this, he banishes the Igigi (angels, basically) who followed \nKingu and Tiamat. He kills Kingu, mixes his blood with dirt and makes \nhumans. \n\n2b) *Epic of Ba'al*: And the weapon springs from the hand of Baal. Like a \nraptor from between his fingers. It *strikes the skull of Prince Yam*, \nbetween the eyes of Judge Nahar. Yam collapses, *he falls to the earth.* \nHis joints quiver, and his spine shakes. Thereupon *Baal drags out Yam and \nwould rend him to pieces*; he would make an end of Judge Nahar (I think \nthis is the dragon and Yam as one.) However, Athtart pleads for Yam, who \nacknowledges the Lord as king of heaven.\" -- \"As you smote Lothan the *twisting \nserpent*, you destroyed the *crooked serpent, the seven-headed tyrant* . . \n. \"\n\n(Tablet's broken so the ellipses are breaks in the tablet) but basically he \nestablished days, nights, seasons, etc. \n\n\"...Now, too, the seasons of his rains will Baal observe, the \nseasons...with snow\" \n\n\n3) *Bible Parallels*: Ductape your mind because it's about to get blown!!\n\na)Genesis: \"But God is my King from ancient times, he brings salvation on \nthe earth. It was you who split open the sea by your power; *you broke the \nheads of the monster in the waters. It was you who crushed the heads of \nLeviathan* (Sound familiar?Lothan!) and gave it as food to the creatures of \nthe desert. *It was you who opened up springs and streams.* You dried up \nthe ever-flowing rivers. *The day is yours, and yours also the night; you \nestablished the sun and moon. It was you who set all the boundaries of the \nearth; you made both summer and winter.*\"\n\nImportant Note: Hebrew word for \"Sea\" is \"Yam\", again...sound familiar? You \ncan actually do a direct substitution whenever we see...\"sea\". Remember, we \nonly found these after we've been using the bible for hundreds of years.  \n\nb)Job: By his power he stills the sea; by his wisdom *he cut Rahab* \n(Leviathan) *the great sea monster* to pieces. By his breath the skies \nbecame fair; his hand *pierced the fleeing serpent.*\n\nc) Revelation: Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great \nred *dragon having seven heads* and ten horns, and on his heads were seven \ndiadems. And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw \nthem to the earth.\" \n\n(This means that he caused the \"Angels\" to follow him and end up being \nthrown to the Earth due to his actions. This is the same as Tiamat's \nfollowers being thrown down to Earth after Marduk defeats the dragon.)\n\n\"So that *huge dragon \u2013 the ancient serpent, the one called the devil and \nSatan*, who deceives the whole world \u2013 was *thrown down to the earth, and \nhis angels along with him.*\n\n*Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth*, for the first heaven and earth \nhad ceased to exist, and *the sea existed no more.*\" \n\nSo as you can see just like all the stories from that region that came \nbefore it, the biblical stories are just fanfiction based on the originals. \nGenesis, Psalms, Revelation, etc use these stories mesh the Babylonian \nstory, the Canaanite story, and their own, to get what you have but are \nultimately the same story.\n\nStorm god defeats an ancient dragon which represents the sea, and then \ncreates a new heaven and earth along with some brand new sentient life, us. \nThanks or reading."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpqBiK-iHAhk29P5yoh4ZeA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "islandonlinenews", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ydpirmpvau51mt23hd3vgdu3zirjhg04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-06T00:04:08.045Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCpqBiK-iHAhk29P5yoh4ZeA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.98099616999999995, "formal_score": 14, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-06T00:04:08.045Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aCtlq7quHKA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAS4/8i6Yuq5VOis/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106112727243067928815", "textDisplay": "+MrOmniblast ?????Revelation? the book? is a rip off??"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt1ZUJUi5pAjf4W1B4mwnQA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Flyingtart", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ydpirmpvau51mt23hd3vgdu3zirjhg04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-04T03:48:20.280Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCt1ZUJUi5pAjf4W1B4mwnQA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.55460799999999999, "formal_score": 23, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-04T03:48:20.280Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-24WWU5zJAZM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMM/jG_R0PyFAmM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109618192472833312558", "textDisplay": "+islandonlinenews\nThe epic of Gilgamesh was written way before the story of Noah.

But \nbecause you were polite and seemed honest, I will give it a try. But \nplease, know that your level of knowledge on these subjects is very lacking \n(not an insult), so just read and consider what I say instead of \nautomatically discounting what I say and coming up with an excuse that is \nprobably in error. And I have a quick question: Is English your first \nlanguage?\nSo, on to the task at hand...\nYou said: Abiogenesis has NOTHING to do with evolution. \nMy reply: I was pointing out that, while they are different scientific \ntheories, they do have something to do with each other. So you were \noverstating your case when you said they have NOTHING to do with each \nother. They both attempt to explain and account for life in a naturalistic \nand materialistic way, and they are both talked about and taught in biology \nclasses. Yes, everybody knows that technically they are two separate \ntheories, but they so have a significant relationship. It isn't like \ntalking about the theory of Gravity and the Germ Theory of Disease - those \ntwo things have NOTHING to do with each other; whereas, Abiogenesis and \nDarwinian Evolution have much more to do with each other. The reason why \npeople like to completely separate them is because with Abiogenesis, they \nstrain so very hard as to loose credibility when they try to talk about it \nscientifically and claim that the theory is true and sound. So when the \nobvious errors and assumptions are brought out with Abiogenesis, those same \nerrors and assumptions easily carry over into Darwinian Evolution, and \nevolutionists don't like that. \nSo you are correct if you say, Abiogenesis and Darwinian Evolution are two \ndifferent theories, but don't say they have NOTHING to do with each other. \nBy doing this you sound overzealous in the same way a religious person \nsounds when they make overstated claims about God.\n\nYou say: Only because we do not know where life came from doesn't mean we \ndon't know how it evolved.\nMy reply: Obviously this is true by definition. But in practice/reality, we \ndon't know how life started, and we don't know how it evolved. NeoDarwinian \nEvolution attempts to provide a mechanism for how it happened, but I think \nthat in the same way you don't know how life started, you don't know how it \nevolved. You can see how scientists attempt to deal with Abiogenesis, and \nits obvious failures. Take that same view and move it to Darwinian \nEvolution and you can see how that theory falls short as well. You don't \nhave to be afraid of being dumb or unscientific if you start to doubt \nDarwinain Evolution. I know lots of doctors, teachers with masters degrees \nin science and biology, and other people like this that all don't believe \nthat Darwinian Evolution can explain what we observe in life. Despite what \nsome or most evolutionists say, there are good reasons for this. We will \nbasically all admit that it is a good theory in a lot of ways, but that \nupon critical analysis, it does seem to lack the ability to account for \nmuch of life. I know that I didn't get into detail about this or provide \nany examples, (if you want we can address that later) but just realize that \nin the same way Abiogenesis fails, so does Darwinian Evolution.\n\nYou say: By evolution you mean \"change over time\". But that definition is \ntoo simple and broad to really explain what is meant by evolution. That is \nsaying something that is very small and simple and nobody argues with and \nthen saying because that is true, that everything else that Darwinian \nEvolution claims is true. That is like saying that going to the moon is \nlifting off the surface of the earth. Then talking about and showing \nmillions of examples of people jumping up into the air, flying in a hot air \nballoon, and flying in an airplane - then assuming that you have \nscientifically shown how to get to the moon. \nTo put it another way, \"change over time\" is demonstrated in a single \ngeneration. When a human mother and father have a baby, there is a change \nthat occurs over that time. The baby has different genes than the father \nhas and different ones than the mother. It also looks different than either \nthe mother or the father, so change has occurred over a short time. But you \ncan see how this doesn't explain or account for the entire biosphere from \nthe simplest self-replicating molecule. To include more time and more \nchange, like selectively breeding a Golden Lab from a common dog ancestor \nshows more change over a greater amount of time. That is often confused for \nshowing Darwinian Evolution in the same way Darwinian Evolution attempts to \naccount for all of life. Breeding a dog is the manipulation of gene \nexpression. The genes already existed in the original and they were just \nspecially selected for various configurations of expression. But that \ndoesn't account for how the original dog ancestor came to be in the first \nplace. So saying evolution is \"change over time\" is a bait-and-switch \ntechnique. It hooks you in to believing a small aspect of the theory and \nthen tricks you into believing everything about the theory. It's like a car \nsalesman advertising that he is selling a car for $5, but then when you get \nthere to buy it, he only has cars available for $5,000. You would instantly \nknow that something wasn't right. (if you want we can discuss specific \nexamples of evolution in later posts if you have questions about them).\n\nYou say: Evolution isn't necessarily gain, but yes in most creatures gain \nhappened, but this isn't the aim of evolution. \nMy reply: Your kind of missing the point and talking in circles. If you \nstart with a single self-replicating molecule and then go to a modern \ncreature like a human, a HUGE amount of gain happened. This is true with \nEVERY creature alive today. So Darwinian Evolution necessarily attempts to \nexplain how that massive amount of gain happened. Again we have this \nbait-and-switch technique when we talk about evolution not necessarily \nbeing gain. We all know that some change, which can be called evolution, \ncan occur by changing gene expression without gaining information. This \nsame evolution can occur if information is lost (a fish that loses its eyes \nif it lives in a dark cave).  And we know that supposed evolution doesn't \nhave an aim. But you can't talk about these small lateral changes brought \nabout by gene expression or the loss of genes and then make the leap that \nbecause that occurs, Darwinian Evolution can easily account for the entire \nbiosphere of biological information. Again, that's bait-and-switch. That \nwould be like claiming that I know how to get to Tom Cruise's house, \nexactly - and proving it to you by saying, watch me move. I can move a \nlittle left and a little right. I can walk forward and backwards. You see, \nin order to travel, I don't NECESSARILY have a direction in mind. And by \nthe way, because I showed you all of this movement, I scientifically showed \nyou that I did indeed got to Tom Cruise's house. (remember that analogies \nand metaphors aren't exact representations, they show a point, but break \ndown fairly quickly - so don't get hung up on it.)\n\nYou say: You cannot change the past, dealing with falsehoods that were \ntaught about Evolution. It's true, and they have made improvements. But the \npoint to remember is that things were and are taught that are outright \nlies. They are taught for decades after they are known to be lies. It is \nonly after a lot of public pressure that these things are finally purged \nout of the teachings. This is human behavior. It is psychological, social, \nand political. All these human characteristics play into science and its \nteachings as well. One is ignorant not to understand this. So, most people \ntry to hold \"science\" up as a perfect system of mathematical/robotic \ncalculation, (like the terminator - it feels no pain, it cannot be \nbargained with, it cannot be reasoned with, it feels no pity or remorse, \nand it will not stop, EVER, until the truth is known.) The fact is that a \nscience is a human endeavor conducted through human institutions. So there \nis a lot of money, power, prestige, and pride that comes along with it. \nThere is a lot of politics and philosophy that come into science. This is \nnot some small, passing point; it is the very nature of the process that we \nare talking about. \n\nThere is so very much more to say about everything, but I have to stop at \nsome point. Let me know what you think and if you have any more questions."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMusvhQ3vR28xbfbp0NGAqg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Herr Zweistein", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xut1jhmaehh3l222ys13phpebvhqcr", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-04T04:41:08.358Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMusvhQ3vR28xbfbp0NGAqg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.40101000000000003, "formal_score": 15, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-04T04:41:08.358Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Migdw1xeqlk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD4/LSGl91zhlKc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102448419152324307742", "textDisplay": "+jimmi izzy Ok, i do not know what kind of errors I made, because \neverything I see is actually ok.

In reality, there are a near infinite \namount of gaps between our knowledge and the real world. This reality is \ntoo complex to have it any other way. Science fills in its gaps with \nphilosophical assumptions, and religion does it with its assumptions and \nbeliefs. If you don't understand this or don't believe it, then you either \nhaven't studied the issue enough, or don't have the depth of intellect to \ngrasp it. (that's not an insult. It's just saying that one must move beyond \none's own centric point of view for a proper understanding.) There is MUCH \nphilosophy, politics, money, and other things that goes into science - and \nthat cement and mortar fills in all the gaps that the average person \ndoesn't see.\n\nYou say, \"Abiogenesis has nothing to do with evolution.\" That comment is \noff-base. As Kent would say, \"First you have to define what you mean by \nevolution.\" And I agree with him that the definition is often changed for a \n\"bait and switch\". If you define evolution to mean biological evolution \nAFTER life already started, then yes; abiogenesis would fall outside that \nboundary. But, if you are talking about life/biology, life and biology \nsciences, and theories about life and how it came to be. Then abiogenesis \nis a part of that. And in a lot of biology/science textbooks, you will find \nabiogenesis included in the same section that talks about evolution. So, \ndon't get hung up on the fact that there is a difference between \nNeo-Darwinian evolution and abiogenesis, all of this debate about life and \norigins isn't always as well regulated as your objection would assume it is.\n\nYou say, \"Evolution is not gaining, its just changing.\" That idea is \noff-base. Assuming abiogenesis, if you have whatever simple \nconfiguration/information that was working then, compared to what we see \ntoday there is MASSIVE gain that must be accounted for. That gain is \nattempted to be accounted for with the theory of evolution. You are correct \nthat evolution isn't necessarily a gain; it can be only change without \ngain. It can even be loss in some cases. But, those specific instances do \nnot exclude nor negate what the theory of evolution is attempting to \nexplain, and that is A LOT OF GAIN. You are using a logical fallacy here. \n\nYou say, \"There are new pictures\".\nHowever, those pictures where used - while knowing that they were \ninaccurate, for a long time and all the way up until not that long ago \n(we're talking only a decade or two). They were in the textbooks that I \nread. So one point he is demonstrating is that we shouldn't believe \neverything just because it is reported or taught to be science. He is \nsaying that outright lies and falsehoods are reported and taught as science \nbecause they support a certain worldview/philosophy. \nAnd it's not even that the exact pictures were used well after they were \nknown to be fraudulent; it's the idea, which is incorrect, that was taught \nand is still being taught. Remember, you said \"there are new pictures\".  So \nthey are using new pictures to teach an incorrect idea. That's no better. \nOntogeny recapitulates phylogeny  (the development in the womb relives the \nevolutionary development of the creature) is a false theory. However, \npeople were outright taught this until not that long ago, and are still \ntaught this today - howbeit in not so outright terms. I have spoken to \nretired doctors that claim that it is true because they were taught it in \ntheir medical training. I have argued with 50 year old people who thought \nthat it was true because they were taught it in high-school. \nThe other thing that those drawing were showing was similarities in \nembryology provides evidence that we all evolved from a common ancestor. It \ndoesn't. Any visual similarity in a zygote or a fetus provides NO evidence \nof common ancestry. Those creatures that they are showing are only a  few \nweeks old from being a single cell. They are so underdeveloped that if they \nseem to have some visual similarity, that provides no evidence for their \nrelationship. Their similarity or dissimilarity isn't measured by how they \nlook; it's measured by the information they contain. So one who has \nunderstanding can grasp the propaganda that is being displayed when they \nuse that line of evidence.  \n\nI hope you can understand the errors you have made in this post. I am not \nsaying that everything that Kent says is correct. I am not saying that \nevolution is false. I am just saying that the things that you are said are \nnot as accurate as you try to make them come across (or to put it bluntly, \nthey are inaccurate)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNteha2hfCngSiyIeTvEVHg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Adaam Pitterson", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xut1jhmaehh3l222ys13phpebvhqcr", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-26T22:54:32.693Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNteha2hfCngSiyIeTvEVHg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.73401399999999994, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-26T22:54:32.693Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105911280898398750213", "textDisplay": "+Herr Zweistein no problem.

Those are actually the \nexact same processes just happening over millions or billions of years.\n\nIt's important to remember that no baby has ever been born that wasn't the \nsame species as it parent.  No one is claiming that a fish gave birth to a \nzebra.  That would be crazy.  However slowly over time small change after \nsmall change eventually does lead to what is now a new species.\n\nThink of it like the aging of a human.  You don't have a child and then one \nday they wake up and are an adult.  It's a slow process of the years with \neach day seeming as if nothing has changed at all.  However clearly there \nare changes happening every day they are just too subtle to be noticed.\n\nSo in the same way that a child becomes an adult is how you go from one \nspecies to another over time with millions of small changes along the way.  \nMost people who scream about species change simply are not properly \nconceiving of how long 4 billion years is.  Of course we don't see one \nspecies change into another in our lifetimes or even in recorded history \nthrough natural selection.  Since recorded history is about \n1/1,000,000,000th of the time that life has been evolving her on earth.\n\nHowever what we know is through man-made selection we have turned a wolf \ninto the vast number of various breeds of dogs.  It would seem crazy to \nthink that a poodle and a great dane both have the same ancestors.  Yet \nalong these paths a rottweiler never game birth to a beagle or any other \nsuch nonsensical happenings.  Just generation by generation we have turned \nthe wolf into hundreds of types of dogs from the very small to the very \nlarge."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeQWgkz1MZRHYCwtFK5AFOw", "inappropriate_score": 1.941747572815534, "authorDisplayName": "bloodsportstar", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z121grughvnth5oig04chpmgfq22c1bqk10", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-09T09:46:04.450Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeQWgkz1MZRHYCwtFK5AFOw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8200461, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-09T09:46:04.450Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ooF7r-HFegA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Toab64rtHi8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106880556131903823264", "textDisplay": "Viruses evolving to being immune to our anti biotics is not the same as \nfish turning into zebras!!

This was terribly written and I hope I \nclarified it sufficiently.\n\nI'm actually a fairly humble person if you know me. The problem we have is \nI made a critique about the lack of integrity of this video and your \nresponses were a combination of dishonest and pointless. Right now I am not \nsaying that to be mean, it is just the truth.\n\nWhen +FreeAgent claimed that Nye was \"afraid\" to debate Mr. Hovind, I \nresponded that not only was this a baseless claim but that Hovind's \ncredentials are questionable. Hovind wrote a questionable doctoral \ndissertation and the source of his entire degree is questionable itself.\n\n+william Green I found your comment irrelevant to my comment. I will admit \nI was mean about this but I will try to clarify why. You refer to me as an \nevolutionist, first off, there is no such thing, second I never made any \nmention to evolution in my post. With this statement \"way to go team \n(SATAN).\" you swap out god with Satan (which, fun fact, as a non-proper \nnoun simply means adversary in Hebrew). I do not believe in satan nor did I \nmake any mention of satan to imply I had any belief in him. Next you state \nthat I worship a theory. Evolution is a well supported theory that gives an \naccurate explanation of the forces behind species variation. I worship it \nabout as much as I worship gravitational theory, which, in case I have to \nexplain, is not at all. Finally you mention satan again and again I don't \nbelieve in satan. The difference between my initial comment and your \ncomment is that mine was in direct response to a video. Critiquing it and \nthe people who support and justify it with faith in god. If you did not \nfall into this perspective, the post would not be relevant to you. Your \ncomment, on the other hand, was not relevant to anything I presented.

You should find this level of \ndishonesty shameful. If you don't, I find that to be a reflection of your \ncharacter and the character of the people who think and believe the way you \ndo. I also find your arguments to be sophomoric in their understanding of \nthe topics at hand. You are using confirmation bias to attempt to seek out \nwhat you feel are flaws in a theory that honestly, I have nothing to do \nwith. I am now adding that your methods of manipulating this discussion are \nalso shameful. You do not act like adults and have demonstrated, in my \nhumble opinion, that you lack the critical thinking skills to produce \nmeaningful work and lash out against those who do. Not to say that I am \npersonally among those meaningful people. Finally, if you choose to ignore \nthe facts I can't make you accept them.

(Noah's time).  We can get so \npopulated and so dispersed in such a short time? \nit's possible, but seems highly unlikely. I think folks are miscalculating \nand misinterpreting the scripture, which concerning creation seems to just \ngive a brief sketch: \"the scripture speaks many times figuratively \nthroughout, man because of his big ego has decided he knows everything, \nhe's got it all figured out. i don't think that's the case at all. \"repent, \nand become as little children or you WILL NOT enter the kingdom of heaven.\" \nC'mon now, let's admit we don't know it all, we don't understand \neverything. Now, I think the account of creation is a brief figurative \nsketch that many don't comprehend, and try to interpret erroneously. Also, \nI'm of the opinion that true religion and true science are not in conflict. \nFrancis Bacon, the father of the scientific method was a Christian man.\nDoes the scripture speak of a literal \"morning and evening\" when the sun \nand moon were not yet in place? \nDoes it speak of a 24 hour day when \"a day is as a thousand years to the \nLord?\"\nHere is a view that I wrote a while back: \n\"- there is true, God-given science.\nThe father of the scientific method, Francis Bacon,\nprayed every day like: 'that the Father and Son and the Holy Ghost \nbless my humble work to the betterment of the miserable lot of man.'\ntrue science and the Word of God are not contradictory.\nthe EGO of man dictates to him that he must know everything,\nso he makes up that he understands all that the Bible says about \neverything; \nthat God created the universe in 144 hours and then rested for 24 hours...\n(the sun and moon by which we calculate our time, were not in place until \nthe 4th day, \nso the first 3 \"days\" could have been billions of years for all we know) \ncertainly the scripture teaches us that God wants His creation viewed as \nbeing accomplished in 7 periods of time; \n6 in active creation and a 7th period of rest...\nthese \"days\" are arbitrary periods of time, since a day is as a thousand \nyears to the Lord.\nSo, if you calculate by counting the years of Adam and his progeny,\nthat the world is almost 6000 years old, then, if a day is as a thousand \nyears, the world is about 1.8 million years old.\nBUT, i think what \"a day is as a thousand years to the Lord\"\nreally means is that He doesn't view time like we do at all,\nand that maybe a day is even as a million years to the Lord.\nHe doesn't have the sun and moon spinning around in front of him like we do \nto calculate our time...\nSo, if an honest scientist using the scientific method measures that a \nCaucasian-looking skull found in a cave in Oregon \nis at least 10,000 years old...should I say he is using a pseudo-science?\" \nCertainly, the scripture states that the flood wiped out every living thing \nin all the world and that Noah and his few repopulated the WHOLE earth; \nagain I say this is possible through the supernatural work of God. \nYet, is this a LITERAL statement or is the scripture speaking FIGURATIVELY \nas it sometimes does.\n Fish could survive such a flood? Seagulls could survive? In about 5000 \nyears, could we naturally get such a diversity and geographically dispersed \npeoples? \nDoes the Word perhaps mean that \"MOST EVERYTHING\" was destroyed? Does the \noriginal language allow for this understanding? Apparently, a local flood \nis not totally incompatible with scripture.\nPeople look much the same today as they did in the days of the ancients \n2000 years ago. \nSo, it seems an amazing thing that 5000 years after Noah, we have people so \ndifferent looking as Chinese, Indians, Negros, Aborigines, Europeans & \netc.?? In my opinion, the line of Adam and Eve may not have been the very \nfirst peoples on this earth.

In research carried out in the\nUnited States, particle physicists have shown that light pulses\ncan be accelerated to up to 300 times their normal velocity of\n186,000 miles per second.\nThe work was carried out by Dr. Lijun Wang, of the NEC\nResearch Institute in Princeton, who transmitted a pulse of\nlight towards a chamber filled with specially treated cesium\ngas (\u201cFaster than Light Maybe But Not Back to the Future\u201d\nNew York Times ).See also Part #7 and articles on our Web site.\"\n\n\n\n\nNow, does something strike you odd outright about this... Hovind is \nclaiming that, and I quote: \n\n\n*SCIENTISTS claim they have broken the ultimate speedbarrier: the speed of \nlight.*\n\n\nHave you heard of this monumental achievement which would redefine all of \nphysics as we know it??????? No, of course you haven't as it simple is not \ntrue. What the scientists did was to make group velocity of light travel \n300 times the value of c...which is not AT ALL as saying we broke the speed \nof light barrier. The group velocity is an apparent, non-mass, non \ninformational property of a light wave...it is not the same as the leading \nedge or front velocity of the wave which is c. c is a constant in the \nuniverse and that is the barrier, but here he claims that barrier was \nbroken! \n\n\nGroup velocity is just how fast \"wave packets\" move, but it really just \nkinda of an optical illusion...like those marquee lights which flash the \nbulbs on and off so it appears there a movement of a off bulb around it? \nThere really isn't anything moving physically, it is just an illusion. \n\n\nBut Hovind, having NO experience in physics states it as:\n\n\n\"SCIENTISTS claim they have broken the ultimate speed\nbarrier: the speed of light. \"\n\n\nto try to give some credibility to his prior claim that c could have been \ndifferent or is variable and not a constant.\n\n\nSEE where I am going here by Hovind being completely disingenuous either by \nignorance or deliberately lying? I HIGHLY doubt ANY one who reviewed this \nwho knew physics wouldn't have stopped and gone...hey, no....we didn't \nbreak the speed of light barrier that isn't what the paper was saying AT \nALL!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1SzlwfeQ_4-9LuV_00Efuw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Steve McRae", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12dgf2g2lr1t3xas04chtaosoqwen4ydgo", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-06T04:02:28.438Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1SzlwfeQ_4-9LuV_00Efuw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.14186000000000004, "formal_score": 79, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-06T04:02:28.438Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n0bBBU6v7qk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPg/FghwZ_c4Vb4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109071300495237504302", "textDisplay": "+william Green BTW I WAS in the process of writing that BEFORE your last \nmessage LOL!

That doesn't sound like a lot, but figure \nif the decay rate changed by 13.27% what other constants would also be \neffected because of the fine structure constant changes. C would change of \ncourse and if c changed then \u03bc_0 and \u03f5_0 would change since 1/c^2 = \u03bc_0\u03f5_0, \nwhich would mean by quantitative analysis if c^2\u2191 then \u03bc_0\u03f5_0 \u2193 .\n\n\nSo we would have an extremely small value for \u03bc_0\u03f5_0 so the strong nuclear \nforce wouldn't even be strong enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier due to \nthe change of magnetic permeability and electric permittivity so atoms \nwouldn't form...at least probably no more than hydrogen I would \nimagine...stars couldn't under go fusion, life would pretty well cease to \nexist as we know it.\n\n\nSo, it just seems to me that either we assume that the decay rates have \nbeen constant, light speed has been constant, magnetic permeability and \nelectric permittivity have been constant or we go with Hovind's suggestion \nthat decay rates have changed (or no way to know) and/or his suggestion \nthat c is not constant (how he explains starlight appearing so far \naway)...and we completely destroy the universe.\n\n\nIDK...kinda seems like an easy call to make on this one don't you think?"}}]}, "z13cd5ciryvsitxxj04cehobqmardnahmdg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHkuc3HGxW9bwP9Kjm64CDw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "gratefulapostate", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-08T03:22:37.259Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHkuc3HGxW9bwP9Kjm64CDw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.54684400000000011, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2015-04-08T03:22:37.259Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115057573984891049849", "textDisplay": "Do you have to go to a special school to learn that kind of stupid or is it \njust Kent's natural gift?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z135eb1wgzbixbv3m231yngpazbozhbbu04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 11, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc4R9cY4S8e7N3poBMrIK4g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dJbpX5IwogI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQc/4_fIAV8k91A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "rob jabbaz", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-06T16:08:20.959Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc4R9cY4S8e7N3poBMrIK4g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.411526, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-03-06T16:08:20.959Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107245697749927122551", "textDisplay": "can i get saved online.. just incase? will it take long? how much do i have \nto pay?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpqBiK-iHAhk29P5yoh4ZeA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "islandonlinenews", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135eb1wgzbixbv3m231yngpazbozhbbu04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-12T02:23:05.907Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCpqBiK-iHAhk29P5yoh4ZeA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99997151740000001, "formal_score": 50, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-12T02:23:05.907Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aCtlq7quHKA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAS4/8i6Yuq5VOis/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106112727243067928815", "textDisplay": "+rob jabbaz peace"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc4R9cY4S8e7N3poBMrIK4g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "rob jabbaz", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135eb1wgzbixbv3m231yngpazbozhbbu04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-11T03:56:35.923Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc4R9cY4S8e7N3poBMrIK4g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.98983021999999998, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-11T03:56:35.923Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dJbpX5IwogI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQc/4_fIAV8k91A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107245697749927122551", "textDisplay": "OMG!

Actually, you'd have to remove everything from string \ntheory to germ theory and pretty much the entire field of geology (to \nmention some) if direct observation in the moment and with the naked eye \nare the only criteria for being scientific. You forget that there are other \nways of observing and testing than sitting down and look at something.\nFor example, one way to test a scientific theory is to use it to make \npredictions. By the laws presented in the theory of evolution, distribution \nof a species should cause intermediate species to leave fossils in areas \nbetween their ancestors and their descendants. This method of predicting \nwhere to find fossils of intermediate species has been used countless times \nand has been very successful. Another test is that since the laws presented \nin the theory of evolution states that all life on earth is related, it \nshould be possible to build an evolutionary family tree for all organisms \nhere. Doing so has enabled us to find out everything from migration \npatterns of land animals to the origin point for the AIDS virus.\nFarmers and breeders have also used the process of selecting crop and \nanimals among variation among offspring to make new plants and animal \nbreeds, like cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, chiuauas and saint \nbernards. The difference between this and the kind of selection that \nhappens in nature is that human preference, while in nature it's preditors, \nclimate, landscape, chemicals and so on that selects which individuals are \nallowed to have offspring.\nThese are just a few examples of how the theory of evolution can be and has \nbeen tested. And don't say \"that's not what evolution is\" because that IS \nwhat evolution is. It's \"change in heritable traits of biological \npopulations over successive generations\", like when a wolf changes into a \nchiuaua over several generations.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution\nIf you didn't know this, then like I said, you don't understand what \nevolution is. If you get your information from sites like talkorigins.org, \ncreation.com, creationstudies.org or answersingenesis.org you're asking to \nbe lied to. They have businesses that would be ruined if people understand \nhow evolution works and that it debunks creationism, and are therefore \nbiased and unreliable sources on that topic. They even say in their \nStatement of Faith that \"by definition, no apparent, perceived or claimed \nevidence in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it \ncontradicts the scriptural record. Of primary importance is the fact that \nevidence is always subject to interpretation by fallible people who do not \npossess all information.\"\nhttps://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/\nThis pretty much means that they'll ignore any reality if it contradicts \ntheir doctrine. That's the opposite of the scientific method, which is to \nuse observations and evidence to draw conclusions if they confirm \nhypotheses through tests. Science is about looking for answers in the real \nworld, not confirming what some religion's doctrine says.\nAn easy test to see if something is scientific: Can you use it to make \npredictions? If the answer is yes, then yay, it's scientific!\n\nIf you want to know what evolution is, read up on scientific sites and \narticles, preferably peer-reviewed ones. Pick up a good biology book and \nstop thinking people like Kent Hovind and Ken Ham know anything at all \nabout evolution. Like I said, they keep setting up strawmen and attack them \ninstead of the actual scientific theory of evolution. If someone say that \nwe \"came from monkeys\", that's a pretty clear sign that they have no idea \nwhat evolution is, since according to evolutionary theory, we are \nbiologically still within the ape superfamily, and we share common \nancestors with other apes. We didn't come from gorillas or chimps, just as \nwe don't come from our sisters or cousins. Another clear sign that they \nhave no idea what evolution is is when they say that \"something came from \nnothing\". For one thing, they usually refer to the so-called Big Bang \ntheory, which is a seperate field of study from evolution, and even that \ndoesn't state that everything came from nothing. They are the ones stating \nthat, and creatonists keep parroting them, thinking they are clever.\nWithin evolutionary theory the transition from non-living matter to living \nmatter is the transition from chemical evolution to biological evolution, \nsomething I doubt they have even bothered to look up. As for the big bang \nthere are several hypotheses about what was before it. It's one of the \nstill unsolved mysteries of the universe, and it's a very facinating one at \nthat. Most of the hypotheses don't assume there was nothing before the big \nbang, yet creationists like to pick the one that does and claim that is \nwhat all scientists claim is the only answer. Again, it's a strawman.\nAnd to clear up the confusion I'm sure I've caused you now, the big bang \ntheory is a scientific theory with evidence to back it up. It's not a \nhypothesis. What caused the big bang however are still only hypotheses, and \nare therefore not reliable. In other words, we don't know what caused the \ngreat expansion of the universe, but we know it happened. If anyone claims \nto know what caused the universe to expand, or what was before without any \nscientific explanation to back it up, they are merely guessing, and nothing \nmore.\nI only brought up the big bang theory because for some weird reason \ncreationists always do. The theory of the great expansion is only as \nrelated to the theory of evolution as atomic theory is related to germ \ntheory. It's like saying \"atoms don't make sense to me, and we don't even \nknow everything about them, therefore germs don't exist, since germs are \nsupposed to be built up by atoms\".\nIf you read all the way down here and understood it all, I'm impressed! If \nyou did you may actually damage my claim that most creationists don't even \nknow what evolution is (and isn't).\nIf you didn't understand it all however, feel free to ask, and I'll try to \nexplain it in simpler terms.\nIf you see anything wrong in what I said, please let me know, as I care \nabout what is true, I want to learn and I want to be informative and a \nreliable voice of reason. I'm a teacher trainee in Norway, and I want to \nteach my students to be critical, to think for themselves and to be curious \nabout the world they live in, as it is an incredible place."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1yjlKNhmbFMcIRn6XJRkMg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Martin Kortner", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12stbi4pqvwwpody22awfppklfnz1k0y", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-18T17:52:41.947Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1yjlKNhmbFMcIRn6XJRkMg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.40836399999999995, "formal_score": 74, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-18T19:07:37.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S7TYxzR_6ww/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEo/N8b6orqym5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106103668731373163551", "textDisplay": "+bloodsportstar Yes, that's another definition.

This supernatural event, however, is accomplished without a \nsupernatural agent to perform it.\n\nMissler, Chuck, Eastman, Mark, M.D.\"The Creator Beyond Time and Space\", The \nWord for Today 1996\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeQWgkz1MZRHYCwtFK5AFOw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "bloodsportstar", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z123sr5r4yvoeqiskmuayxxggwbwynp01", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-10T17:30:21.097Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeQWgkz1MZRHYCwtFK5AFOw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.35926799999999998, "formal_score": 51, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-10T17:30:21.097Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ooF7r-HFegA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Toab64rtHi8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106880556131903823264", "textDisplay": "It was a big bang and God did it"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrSDrjjmLCzFTi4ENgQUyYQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Zapsie", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z123sr5r4yvoeqiskmuayxxggwbwynp01", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-31T20:03:39.801Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrSDrjjmLCzFTi4ENgQUyYQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.43430600000000003, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-31T20:03:39.801Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Lyi_SRmX7h0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABQ/183s7JgvQR8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101035928033021881258", "textDisplay": "Atheists don't necessarily believe the universe was created by the Big \nBang.

However, \nconclusions are often not always absolute.  As new technologies in science \nemerge, so do new theories that can change what was previously concluded.  \nThe point is, science is always evolving (pun intended).\n\nHovind says that the Big Bang Theory is stupid because no scientist can \nexplain how it happened.  Answer: With current science, we can see and \nprove the EFFECT and thereby lead us to the THEORY.\n\nCreationist say that God created the universe 10,000 years ago (which \nscience can prove wrong) in 6 days (an impossibility without magic) and had \nto rest on the 7th day (being omnipotent, why did he need to rest?).  And \nthe only evidence is....the Bible says so.\n\nThe clips of Kent Hovind came from another video called \"100 Reasons Why \nEvolution is Stupid\", which is 1:49:48 long.  I spent some time over the \nperiod of 3 days watching the video, stopping it, then checking the things \nthat Hovind said.  He continuously quote mined scientists, told half-truths \nabout experiments and science principles, and told stories about UNNAMED \nscientist and professors (like the one he supposedly had a conversation \nwith on an airplane) that were very questionable.  I could only stomach 1:10 \nof it!\n\nFor the Creationists and Christians out there.  I am not an Atheist.  I do \nbelieve in a Creator.  However, you all need to stop taking the Bible as \nLITERAL TRUTH.  You need to stop listening to people like Hovind and Ken \nHam (Creationist Museum) and look at the science that they are misquoting.  \nFor example, Hovind is right in saying that carbon-dating cannot tell you \nhow old fossils are.  What he does NOT tell you is that it is NOT USED for \nfossils!  Fossils are PETRIFIED!  Carbon-dating is only used on previously \nliving tissue that are less than 50,000 years old.  There are OTHER methods \nof dating that uses the isotopes of other elements depending on their \nhalf-life, which range from 0.7 years to 1.3 billion years and CAN be used \non inorganic material, such as rock.  Therefore, dating fossils can support \nthe conclusion that animals existed before the Biblical account of Adam and \nEve.  I'm not going to say that the Bible is a falsehood, but the science \npresents you with a contradiction if you take the Bible LITERALLY.  It does \nNOT question your FAITH.  It questions your COMMON SENSE!  Free your minds!\n\nPeace! : )\n\nP.S. You should also study the origins and history of the Bible.  Who wrote \nthe books, when were they written, how many times they were translated and \nwho decided on the present canon.  If you REALLY want a better \nunderstanding of God and Jesus, read non-biblical texts as well.  If you \nhave an open mind, you can learn more about your own religion.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeQWgkz1MZRHYCwtFK5AFOw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "bloodsportstar", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133jjm53vfnwluab04cfdwx3mjswt5xww00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-18T07:48:57.180Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeQWgkz1MZRHYCwtFK5AFOw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.67171000000000003, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-18T07:48:57.180Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ooF7r-HFegA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Toab64rtHi8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106880556131903823264", "textDisplay": "Wrong....

I am reading the King \nJames Version which was translated from the original texts. Allow me to \nshare the following from the same chapter that you quoted :\n\nExodus 21:16\n\"And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his \nhand, he shall surely be put to death.\"\n\nThis is basically saying that forced slavery is forbidden under Biblical \nlaw and punishable by death. Now taking it by itself, one could argue \"Oh \nit's just forbidding stealing people as slaves from their current masters\". \n But in conjunction with:\n\nDeuteronomy 23:15-16\n\"15 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped \nfrom his master unto thee:\n16 He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall \nchoose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not \noppress him..\"\n\nIt would make sense that it means not to take someone against their will, \nas stealing them with their consent is apparently fine(sarcasm).\n\nFurther, you're quoting the Old Testament.  But this is what Christians \ncall part of the \"New Law\", which is to govern people today:\n\nIndeed, it starts off with something mildly questionable...\n\nEphesians 6:5-8\n\"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the \nflesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;\n6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing \nthe will of God from the heart;\n7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:\n8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he \nreceive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.\"\n\nBut then it follows with...\n\nEphesians 6:9\n\"9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: \nknowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of \npersons with him.\"\n\nNow, the problem with your argument here, is that it takes commands given \nto people in specific instances and tries to imply they were meant as \ngeneral laws.  But that's ridiculous.  Violence is wrong, as a general \nrule.  However, if someone breaks in with a baseball bat and starts \nswinging it at my wife, am I wrong to tackle this person and knock him out \nat very least?  No.  Same for slavery in the Bible.  There are general \nrules, which include \"Do not oppress\", \"do not threaten\", and \"do not \nkidnap\" and then specific instance commands, which make up 99% of the \nmaterial you quoted (and the other 1% doesn't dispute what I'm saying).\n\nThat's why I again encourage you to read the Bible for yourself, study it, \nand understand it because it's clear that your current understanding of the \nBible is based off of a grave misconception, misunderstanding, and a \ntainted presupposition. This is last comment I will make on this subject. I \npray Matt R that you will see the truth and have the wisdom to recognize \nit.

Balderdash!  I had him pegged as a shyster from the moment \nhe opened his mouth.  Then he started going on about \"Why do some moons \nrotate backwards?\"\n\nNits like this tend to think on a purely human level, without considering \nthat events in our own universe happen at an immense scale that requires a \nwider, more encompassing point of view.  So let me scale it down to \nsomething his brain can grasp and something that has been demonstrated in \nbeer halls all over the US time and time again.  If you strike a pool ball \nwith a cue stick below the center point of the ball, at just the right \ndegree, you can in fact, impart a reverse spin on the ball while also \npropelling it forward.  I've done this myself, I rarely play billiards.  \n(Even Tom and Jerry have done this one in the cartoons!)  Now, remove all \nthe resistance of the table and the air, and you will have a ball moving \nendlessly forward while spinning backwards.  Now scale it up to near planet \nsize, and add in a parent planet's gravity field.  Viola!  Moon spinning \nbackward in orbit!  But wait!  What gave it that backward spin?  Remember \nthe pool cue?  Well, it turns out that some moons were struck off of other \nparent bodies in ancient collisions with other objects.  Say two \nplanet-sized asteroids collide while drifting in space, and one or even \nboth, break into fragments.  Those fragments are just like pool balls, \nscattering across the table in every direction, hitting other objects, \nrandomly changing speed and rotation, until they spin a bit too close to \nanother planetary body.  Both are spinning, and we all know that moving \nthings can generate effects like current and magnetism, so the fragment, \nnow covered with a thick layer of dust it has attracted to itself during \nits wandering, finds itself gradually pulled into a path that takes it \naround the planet.  Many such pairings don't end up well, and the orbit \nisn't quite right, so the moon goes spinning off into space, since the \ngravitational pull of the planet didn't hold it captive.  But some moons do \nget roped into orbits, and even retaining their backward spin, they now \ntake a millennial path around its new parent planet. \n\nIf anything, gravity is the one thing science hasn't quite explained yet, \nbut, give us time, we've only been really working on the problem a few \nhundred years.  Turns out it's really hard to recreate gravity's effects in \na lab.  It isn't just \"magnetism\", since not everything is metal.  Just \nexactly what gravity does is not yet well understood.\n\nSo Mr. Hovind, who claims to have \"taught\" science, doesn't know why a moon \ncan rotate backwards?  Any person claiming the title of science teacher, \nshould have the basics of planetary interaction down before attempting to \nteach others, right?  Right?\n\nNow I understand why Bill Nye sighed with worn patience about prevaricators \nlike this Hovind fellow.  He knows that those who embrace religion rarely \nif ever want that belief shaken, and will simply not even consider another \npoint of view, even while asking \"Why does this work this way?\"  Nope, they \njust talk faster and louder, like a clueless American tourist in far \neastern country, sure that the natives will 'get it' if they butcher the \nlanguage by adding more vowels and shouting their questions.  It's exactly \nthe same.\n\nScience and those who study its various field admits when we don't know for \nsure how things work.  After all, we're just beginning as a species, let \nalone getting a handle on why the skies are filled with more galaxies than \nwe can count.  And no, scientists don't know why all those galaxies and \nstars are moving away from one central point, and have been since time \nbegan.  We can't be expected to grasp that one yet, given the scant few \nthousand years \"modern\" man has been around.  All the sciences readily \nadmit they still have a lot of work to do, and endless things to discover \nand understand, but with what we DO know, we can verify some of our \nconclusions.\n\nOne example, which supports the story of the wandering moons is the tale of \nthe Martian meteorites.  There are a few meteorites here on earth that \ndon't conform to the usual spectrum of materials on expects to see in such \nrocks.  One such meteorite, ALH84001, is a stone believed to have come from \nMars.  This was because spectral analysis done on both the rock and Mars \nare very measurable, and very similar.  But we couldn't know for sure until \nwe had advanced enough to send robots there with and onboard chemical \nlab.   That lab, after successfully making the multi-year trip to the red \nplanet, managed to grind off some dust from a rock and analyze it, \nverifying scientific theory that ALH84001 is not only the same composition \nas Mars, but it also was pushed off the planet by some past impact.  Shot \ninto space, it eventually slid into Earth's gravitatonal pull.

They came with 8, after 100 of years they were \nenslaved by masses of egyptians. \n\nReally, taking it literally is a hard thing to do."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMr5wGy9XgtibC1_2Zk_CCQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Soundcomplex", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ucxmipvbugbllr22djvi4mtimhh10v", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-13T04:42:53.810Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMr5wGy9XgtibC1_2Zk_CCQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.226134, "formal_score": 80, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-13T04:42:53.810Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vWSfxlypcO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/K43oiU7bEcU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113819986250891183856", "textDisplay": "+kalzuron (reminder: Evolution is not visible or verifiable) that happens \nWithin a species, It's not changing an ape into a Human.\ufeff\n\nwell, sorry, but it is, we are still part of the ape family, and a part \nfrom that , its also been observed several times already."}}]}, "z13gcdrq2veailqc223felcjhkafddjf5": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3zAdnC0dvYpd2oQx2w0LLA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cXlh2A7fUKc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/cOZkx3O5VV8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Wallace Redd", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-28T05:44:49.993Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3zAdnC0dvYpd2oQx2w0LLA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.83118170000000002, "formal_score": 85, "updatedAt": "2014-12-28T05:44:49.993Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112048535437054553999", "textDisplay": "I don't have enough faith to believe in evolution.

If you want to be one with your \ncreator, and one with nature; then simply put your faith in the blood of \nJesus to wash your sins away, confess Christ as Lord, and turn to serve the \nliving God.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12itlvrbuzeylzf4225u12glufdfbtcu": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeU4fAhT0md6BTqXpiSWSmA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TgSZBNKHMj4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAZU/dXRzXwzJbkI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Nick B.", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T22:20:58.502Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeU4fAhT0md6BTqXpiSWSmA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.13181599999999999, "formal_score": 30, "updatedAt": "2014-09-21T00:07:00.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117189838897572878803", "textDisplay": "There's nothing wrong in believing that God created heaven and earth rather \nthan the Evolution \"Theory\" (like Atheists and some Evolutionists say) they \nare both two good theories however if I'll had to pick one of them I \nbelieve in God/or a higher force is behind it all it makes more sense to \nme, there's alot we can't explain for instance dark energy/dark matter all \nthey claim they know is how it affects the universe and how much dark \nenergy there is; roughly 68% of the universe, dark matter makes up about \n27%, other than that is a complete mystery.

So \nwe will get know where.\n\nIt's almost like a pattern. There's a reason why we can immediately \nunderstand what is wrong  and what isn't. And unless something traumatic or \ndreadful causes you to lose that sense, you have it. It's called a \nconscious.\n\nThe facts are right in your face, all you have to do is look for them- and \nwithout a stubborn, straight-forward perspective.\n\nI'm not foolish, nor stupid.\n\nJust like you, I have an intelligence, and a life. Just know that people \nbelieve in things for a reason. Whether it is God, or someone's trust; it \ndoesn't matter. There's always a reason.\n\nIf I thought Evolution had more of a plausible existence than God, then I \nwould believe it. But I don't.\n\nBecause that contradicts more vital facts, which, to me, makes others \nfaulty.\n\nWe can go on all night and day, but if we don't either say \"to each their \nown\", or at least consider each's ideas and claims as a possible, and make \nan honest conclusion.\n\nSometimes the biggest piece of evidence that paints the picture, can be the \none to cause disbelief, as bizarre as it sounds. Due to one's personal \nvendettas or idea, the facts can easily be missed.\n\nIt is ultimately up to you to decide what is true and what is fiction, but \nit won't change the truth. I'd like to end it here with at least a \nstalemate, but I'd like to confirm something first.\n\nI'll ask you this one question:\n\n\"Do you know about the \"Illuminati\"?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC06D0pdGtOIbEVi5p0W850g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Gary Doss", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13stbnh5k3tfb5lw22verm5hlzsunsjl04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-28T20:35:48.968Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC06D0pdGtOIbEVi5p0W850g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.59921800000000003, "formal_score": 50, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-28T20:35:48.968Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-x7FW8TBC6Bw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAq0/q-rWachFTPQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109432072387985363660", "textDisplay": "+YouMustWakeUp I don't find any 'hints' suggesting some supernatural \norigin.

I have wondered about \ngod a lot.  However, I'm unsatisfied in attributing to god things that are \nunknown, unexplained, or not falsifiable.\n\nI am not saying that the only things that are true are those things which \ncan be tested or demonstrated.  I'm only suggesting that without testing, I \ncan not distinguish between something that is plausibly true and something \nthat is made up.\n\nIf there is no evidence for a worldwide flood, how can I distinguish that \nstory from any other ancient (or modern) story?  The Grand Canyon is often \noffered as evidence.  However, flood waters carve straight paths.  This can \nbe tested as well as observed when floods occur.  On the other hand, rivers \nmeander.  This can also be observed.  The Grand Canyon takes a path that \nmeanders and is not straight.  The evidence is that it was carved by a \nriver.\n\nWhile god can do whatever he wants, what's the difference between a \nworldwide flood claim and any other story?\n\nAs for morality.  Consider that my sister and I have very similar genes and \nthat she has children but I do not.\n\nIn the first scenario, let's assume that I have genes that express \nempathetic behaviors such that I help take care of my sister's kids in some \nway.  Because my sister and I share similar DNA, it is likely she will also \nhave empathetic genes as well as her children.  Even though I am not \ndirectly passing on the gene, the behaviors that the genes express can \ncontribute the gene being passed on by my sibling.  Thus, the gene is \nlikely to propagate throughout a population.\n\nIn the second scenario, let's assume I do not have genes that express \nempathetic behavior.  I do not help my sister with her children.  Again, \nsince my sister and I share similar DNA, she and her children will not have \nthe gene either.  Her children will not benefit from empathetic behavior of \nclose relatives.\n\nThe first scenario is likely to have a better survival rate than the second \nscenario.  Moral behavior is often beneficial to the survival of our \nspecies.

We have been conditioned our whole lives to think \nbelieving in God is stupid, well what do you have to lose by looking into \nit?....Nothing.  I'm telling you there is plenty to lose if you don't. \n Just do it for research purposes.  I'm sure you'll be surprised.  If your \ninterested in conspiracies, look into the NWO, biblical prophecies, the \nnephilim, and the many watchman videos on youtube.  I was an unbeliever \nless than 3 years ago, but I watched an Alex Jones video on 911.  My \nresearch ultimately led me to God.  Because you see, everything our world \nis experiencing right now with the NWO/illuminati was prophesied in the \nBible some 2000 years ago. And Jesus is our ticket out of here, and guess \nwhat?  It's free. Its hard to believe, I know.  Just look into it though, \nand I mean give it a serious go.  You'll see the truth.  Kent Hovind is \ngood, but Pastor Mike Hoggard on youtube is one of my favorite watchman \nministries.  Search some of his videos.  God knows each and every one of us \nand loves you more than you can know, the problem is he gave the devil a \nchance to trick people from following God.  That is the world we live in, a \nfake satanic beast system masterminded by  satan.  Please, you can laugh \nand call me names.  I'm secure in my beliefs.  Just do it for research \npurposes like I said, check into why so many people believe some \"fairy \ntale\".  You'll find that it is in fact the only wholly truthful and  good \nthing in this world.

Again, concrete evidence of the existence of a \nCreative genius who developed these things in an EVOLUTIONARY manner\n\nSee http://www.end-time-issue-ministries.org/Creation.aspx for further \ndiscussion of these points\n\nThis then leaves us with THE massive imponderable, since we could NOT \npossibly exist without the existence of a genius creative agency, \"The \nCreator\" we MUST conclude that He exists -- problem is, where did HE come \nfrom and HOW did He come to be?  This leaves us with \"faith\"\n\nIf one discounts the existence of the Creator then one has to take on board \na level of faith in the ability of all the stuff of which we are made to \nhave come together in an orderly and structured fashion of its own volition \nwith NO creative agency directing it -- one might call that faith in \"blind \nengineering\"\n\nBOTH options require belief or faith in something that is totally \ninexplicable and beyond our comprehension although, for my money, as an \nengineer I have to say it is easier to believe in a Creator than it is to \nbelieve in all this inanimate stuff coming into existence of its own \nvolition and progressively forming itself into massively complex solar \nsystems, planets, plants, animals and humans that reproduce sexually\n\nOne is STILL left with the core imponderable\n\nThe ONLY answer to that is to seek to establish IF the Creator exists and, \nIF one has NOT reached that conclusion from all the widely available \nevidence then one is left with the ONLY option being to actually ASK Him if \nHe exists and see if He answers\n\nSee the article on \"The Creator desires a DEEP personal relationship with \nYOU\" for some guidance on how to do this  \nhttp://www.end-time-issue-ministries.org/Home/CreatorDesiresDeepRelationship.aspx \n-- this includes a suggested way of approaching Him\n\nFrom where I sit, having had MANY dramatic experiences of His existence, \nseen Him work, heard His voice, experienced the moving of His Spirit there \nis NO contest, I know that I know that I know that He is real\n\nI cannot explain where He came from or HOW He came to exist, I simply KNOW \nthat He exists -- you too can come to that position IF you seek Him with \nsincerity and simplicity -- He does NOT respond to brash and prideful \nchallenges, He responds to those who sincerely seek truth\n\nThere is a HUGE amount of error regarding this Creative being whose true \nname is \"Yah the eternally self-existing\" -- see \nhttp://www.end-time-issue-ministries.org/ for much more information\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12csts4kz20ctede22wjx0arsz4ztuvo": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLxp4NQzXuHPZo1u_15a20w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ross F", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-23T06:16:19.232Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLxp4NQzXuHPZo1u_15a20w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.93289770000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-02-23T06:16:19.232Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111125842709753745851", "textDisplay": "You dopey gullible christians need  to look up EVIDENCE in a dictionary oh \nsorry  I forgot, the only book in your house is the bible ! !\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12oznixfsmugzxps04ci5kz2lz4vnxawhk": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpqBiK-iHAhk29P5yoh4ZeA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aCtlq7quHKA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAS4/8i6Yuq5VOis/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "islandonlinenews", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-07T22:36:51.668Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCpqBiK-iHAhk29P5yoh4ZeA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.28224800000000005, "formal_score": 98, "updatedAt": "2014-11-07T22:36:51.668Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106112727243067928815", "textDisplay": "@ freeloadx3\n1.

If \nyou have ears and a brain and listen to this guy very carefully you can \nclearly see that he doesn't actually ever prove a point or know what he is \ntalking about in some cases. Mostly what he does is tell you that this is \nwrong, makes a joke about it and never gives you any evidence of why it is \nwrong.. The only thing he really has going for him is he just sounds \nbelievable and educated. He hardly ever goes into detail with hard evidence \nto disprove the theory of evolution and when he does you can hardly call it \nproof. He is just a mouth talking that has a way with words to trick you \ninto believing that he just gave you hard evidence. Obviously if you are a \ngod fearing Christian and want to believe this guy then your going too. \nThis guy is physical proof of how deceptive and manipulative religion can \nbe against uneducated God fearing people in the hands of another uneducated \nmanipulative asshole using someone's lack of knowledge against them. Not \nonce in this video did he prove a thing. Here are some examples.\n\n\n1. Listen to what he says when he claims to have talked to a professor \nabout the big bang.. First off, I want to know who this professor was and \nwhen he talked to him. That is kind of important to know considering who \nyou are talking too is a very important thing but this guy he is talking to \nobviously doesn't know a damn thing about the big bang for being a \n\"Professor.\" This leaves me to believe that he is making this up following \nwhat he says next about Angular Momentum or the Professor is really a \nfraud. Knowing when this conversation took place is substantial too because \nScientists discover more about the big bang as the years go by.\n\n\n2. Mr. Hovind here is obviously confused, mislead or he is deliberately \nmisleading people because of the lack of their knowledge. In short \nMr. Hovind implies that the Professor believes the universe started out as \na rotating/spinning dot and that not everything in our Solar System follows \nthe laws of Angular Momentum because there are planets and moons that spin \nbackwards and because of that \"In his own words\", the big bang theory is \n\"In Trouble\".....Well that is funny because the big bang theory assumes \nthat when the Universe was created there was \"NOTHING OUTSIDE IT!\" \nTherefore, for the big bang to be rotating/spinning when it occurred \nsuggests that it was rotating relative to something. In other words one has \nto assume it was spinning relative to other Universes in some larger \nspace.'' Mr. Hovind clearly contradicted himself or he intentionally did it \nto mislead people. Either way he clearly has no room to talk.\n\n3. Much of his talks about evolution don't have any fact just opinions and \nhim making jokes. When he brings up facts they are old theories Charles \nDarwin had 150 years ago when the theory was new to the world and there was \nno good scientific methods to support the idea.\n\nI'll go on more about this guy later lol.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12wjt0oglnbebhnj23qhbnr5wzrdpsyq04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFldc5cx9Cwm63cVV-gY-QA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ozNpPSpT_s8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEx4/UP8EUgOlFgI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Chad Webster", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-22T20:09:36.342Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCFldc5cx9Cwm63cVV-gY-QA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.099630000000000052, "formal_score": 44, "updatedAt": "2014-02-22T20:09:36.342Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111541223286821052218", "textDisplay": "More evidence for Genesis chapter 6.

Shouting about lies when it's a fact (evolution happened and is \nhappening) and it is a theory (an explanation of the fact). By the way, in \nscience, a theory cannot be fact.

(*Sucks \nto be you*.)\n\nMy guess is that you haven't a clue about the difference, or that theory \ncannot be fact, much less a lie. Let me explain.\n\nCharles Darwin's *grandfather*, Erasmus Darwin knew (as did every other \neducated person back then, or they could have simply looked at a cut \nthrough a bed of sedimentary rock) the fact that species had changed over \ntime. After all, there was a rather remarkable dearth of dinosaurs walking \naround late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century Britain. That \nis a fact. Also remarkable, there is *still* a dearth of said dinosaurs \nwalking around. \n\n(Full disclosure; there are dinosaurs walking around various Creation \nMuseums but these are not ancient dinosaurs. These are modern dinosaurs.)\n\nErasmus Darwin tried to explain this change in species. He came up with a \ntheory (an explanation) that was shall we say as kindly as possible, \nbat-shit crazy. It was titled *Zoonomia; or the Laws of Organic Life* \n(1794). \n\nCharles Darwin also wanted to explain how species change over time. He \nfigured out that random changes (now called mutations) acted on by \nnon-random natural selection (beneficial changes gave an organism an \nincreased success at passing on those changes; more surviving offspring) \nover vast periods of time (take this to mean more than roughly 6000 years) \nis the explanation for change in species. \n\nHe published this theory in his book *On The Origins Of Species* (1859). \n\nSo far, everything known to be fact in biology supports Darwin's theory. \nYes, the theory has been advanced considerably with modern knowledge, but \nDarwin did get it right. Furthermore, nothing known to be fact in biology \ncontradicts the theory.\n\nAs the title of a 1973 essay by the evolutionary biologist *and Russian \nOrthodox Christian* Theodosius Dobzhansky says, \"\"Nothing in Biology Makes \nSense Except in the Light of Evolution\".\n\nIn science, a theory cannot be fact because tomorrow, new information \n(fact) my call the theory into question or call for it's outright \ndismissal. New information is constantly calling for refinement of theory, \na reworking of certain nuance at the cutting edge of theory and on rare \noccasions, complete overthrow of theory and the need for new theory.\n\nMy guess is that you are a religious person, so I'm assuming you have no \nclue why, in science, this is a *good* thing. \n\nHint; if it was a bad thing, science would accept that every fossil in the \nground was the result of a world-wide flood about 6000 years ago. Guess \nwhat...???"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpqBiK-iHAhk29P5yoh4ZeA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "islandonlinenews", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ogbijyknduvipv04cizlhvkaqi5ewlcw", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-09T21:21:48.602Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCpqBiK-iHAhk29P5yoh4ZeA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.050807999999999964, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-09T21:21:48.602Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aCtlq7quHKA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAS4/8i6Yuq5VOis/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106112727243067928815", "textDisplay": "+Pieter-Ruann Pieters I know EXACTLY what it is.

This applies to good traits as well as bad \ntraits and is not a defense mechanism for denying the existence of the \ntrait within the self.\n\n\"the false-consensus bias is a cognitive bias whereby a person tends to \noverestimate the extent to which their beliefs or opinions are typical of \nthose of others. There is a tendency for people to assume that their own \nopinions, beliefs, preferences, values, and habits are normal and that \nothers also think the same way that they do. This cognitive bias tends to \nlead to the perception of a consensus that does not exist, a \"false \nconsensus\". This false consensus is significant because it increases \nself-esteem.

Richard Steven Walker's \ncontribution to science? Born 1918-1985 He was a mathematician who as a \nscientist helped with the second war effort for Britain, by designing parts \nfor the Lancaster bombers and risked his own life, along with the air crews \nover Germany to test his experimental equipment.  He was a brilliant \nindividual who went on to invent many innovations within his favourite \nsport Angling.  Although I believe an atheist, he came to an observation \nthat was with time testable and found to be a valid fact. That selectively \nbreed fish and carp were in this example, the species referred to, would \nwithin a few generations revert back to the original DNA of the wild \nancestral form by losing those selectively breed characteristics, even if \nthese characteristics were not observably detrimental to survival.  He \nmentions this in his land mark book, called Still Water Angling 1970 \nedition, giving extensive detail of the reversal process.  Walker was aware \nthat information within biology, possessed variation which could be \nartificially exploited though if not continually artificially reinforced by \nfurther or continued selective breeding, would ultimately revers with \nfuture offspring and so realised all this time ago, that it falsified the \nevolution theory, through which he knew to be the fixed law of information \nphenomenon within genetics.  He called it this as the understanding of DNA \nwas not so well understood during his day.  So even large numbers of \natheists up to the present, long after Walker can no longer uphold the \ntheory of evolution, due to the control mechanisms of natural selection \nthrough the reversing of corrupting mutations, so safe guarding DNA \ninformation within a biological correction lock. The problem with many \nscientists today!  Is they are all to willing to dismiss information \nthat takes their pet world view theory of evolution, out of its comfort \nzone of general secular thinking because so many of them have built \nlucrative or publicised careers upon the back of the bum and still woefully \nunproven assumption, which they are all blindly willing to call scientific \nfact, when in reality they could not be any further from the truth. \n                    \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13hvdeonkimvdyxl04chvfwzz2syz2pazw0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1dxmUXHehignMdbGGYZRCQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Andy Kilbride", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-16T02:47:14.659Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1dxmUXHehignMdbGGYZRCQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99473582000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-11-16T02:47:14.659Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114552461605979751759", "textDisplay": "You guys are too dumb to see that kent and eric only want your money\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13bfnkwhnzhdbuzv04cdh0xptqnxfgjx5w": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdJnk6yYyXPwrxblMFM31w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HoP-04nZkT4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAeM/3UrlxALk-xw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Joey M", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-19T09:39:02.957Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrdJnk6yYyXPwrxblMFM31w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.73672800000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-07-19T09:39:02.957Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118400210830670657334", "textDisplay": "Lets all watch kent jerk himself off and play clips of bill nye starting a \nrebuttal but never show him actually getting to it. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z123ebmodsvogzphm04cdp1bcuqwvn1qr5w": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9XH4H2OFJsXNzJ_jS70_Qw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Roseann Bailey", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-05T20:02:04.613Z", "videoId": "UrmHMpyIcdY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9XH4H2OFJsXNzJ_jS70_Qw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.57533199999999995, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-04-05T20:02:04.613Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106237137760127046465", "textDisplay": "A debate?

So bring them on!\" I insist on it.\n\nThe peer-reviewed scientific output from the creationist movement is very \nlow, especially considering the long history and generous funding of the \nmovement.  In a survey of editors of sixty-eight journals, even by the most \ngenerous criteria, only eighteen out of an estimated 135,000 submissions \nwere found that could be described as advocating creationism. One week's \nworth of peer-reviewed papers on evolutionary biology exceeds the entire \nhistory of creationism peer-review.\n\nVirtually none of the papers show any original research.\n\nThe point which discredits creationism, is not that it has few \npeer-reviewed papers, but why there are so few. Creationism proponents \nappear to have no interest in conducting original research that would be \nappropriate for peer-reviewed journals, and other researchers see nothing \nin creationism worth paying attention to. Despite empty claims that \ncreationism is a serious challenge to evolution, nobody takes creationism \nseriously as a science, so nobody writes about it in the professional \nliterature. \n\nThis is not some sort of conspiracy against creationism. Scientists \nthemselves are prevented from publishing in peer-reviewed journals when \ntheir science is not up to par. The peer-review process prevents lots of \nsubstandard work from being published, even from noncreationists. \nCreationists face no obstacles that mainstream scientists do not face \nthemselves.\n\nWhat are you studying anyway? Your baptist bible blabber college can wait, \nhere you can learn something about reality. \n\nUntil then, don't tell me to update my scientific knowledge. You don't know \nwhat you are talking about. Yes, there were some reasonable ad hominems in \nmy last comment. Yet every argument I made is valid. Creationism is not \nscience. Even if evolution would be proven wrong tomorrow - which is not \nvery likely, since evolution is one of the best established scientific \ntheories, you might as well prove gravity wrong - creationism would still \nbe unscientific. Whenever there is no immediate answer at hand, one just \nsays \"*poof* magic!\". It doesn't explain anything.

O. \nlamarckiana has a chromosome number of 2N = 14. The variant had a \nchromosome number of 2N = 28. He found that he was unable to breed this \nvariant with O. lamarckiana. He named this new species O. gigas.\"\n\n\"Digby (1912) crossed the primrose species Primula verticillata and P. \nfloribunda to produce a sterile hybrid. Polyploidization occurred in a few \nof these plants to produce fertile offspring. The new species was named P. \nkewensis. Newton and Pellew (1929) note that spontaneous hybrids of P. \nverticillata and P. floribunda set tetraploid seed on at least three \noccasions. These happened in 1905, 1923 and 1926.\"\n\n\"Owenby (1950) demonstrated that two species in this genus were produced by \npolyploidization from hybrids. She showed that Trapopogonan miscellus found \nin a colony in Moscow, Idaho was produced by hybridization of T. dubius and \nT. pratensis. She also showed that T. mirus found in a colony near Pullman, \nWashington was produced by hybridization of T. dubius and T. porrifolius.\"\n\n\"The Russian cytologist Karpchenko (1928) crossed the radish, Raphanus \nsativus, with the cabbage, Brassica oleracea. Despite the fact that the \nplants were in different genera, he got a sterile hybrid. Some unreduced \ngametes were formed in the hybrids. This allowed for the production of \nseed. Plants grown from the seeds were interfertile with each other. They \nwere not interfertile with either parental species. Unfortunately the new \nplant (genus Raphanobrassica) had the foliage of a radish and the root of a \ncabbage.\"\n\n\"A species of hemp nettle, Galeopsis tetrahit, was hypothesized to be the \nresult of a natural hybridization of two other species, G. pubescens and G. \nspeciosa (Muntzing 1932). The two species were crossed. The hybrids matched \nG. tetrahit in both visible features and chromosome morplology.\"\n\n*Plants not through hybridization:*\n\"Gottlieb (1973) documented the speciation of Stephanomeira malheurensis. \nHe found a single small population (< 250 plants) among a much larger \npopulation (> 25,000 plants) of S. exigua in Harney Co., Oregon. Both \nspecies are diploid and have the same number of chromosomes (N = 8). S. \nexigua is an obligate outcrosser exhibiting sporophytic \nself-incompatibility. S. malheurensis exhibits no self- incompatibility and \nself-pollinates. Though the two species look very similar, Gottlieb was \nable to document morphological differences in five characters plus \nchromosomal differences. F1 hybrids between the species produces only 50% \nof the seeds and 24% of the pollen that conspecific crosses produced. F2 \nhybrids showed various developmental abnormalities.\"\n\n\"Pasterniani (1969) produced almost complete reproductive isolation between \ntwo varieties of maize. The varieties were distinguishable by seed color, \nwhite versus yellow. Other genetic markers allowed him to identify hybrids. \nThe two varieties were planted in a common field. Any plant's nearest \nneighbors were always plants of the other strain. Selection was applied \nagainst hybridization by using only those ears of corn that showed a low \ndegree of hybridi- zation as the source of the next years seed. Only \nparental type kernels from these ears were planted. The strength of \nselection was increased each year. In the first year, only ears with less \nthan 30% intercrossed seed were used. In the fifth year, only ears with \nless than 1% intercrossed seed were used. After five years the average \npercentage of intercrossed matings dropped from 35.8% to 4.9% in the white \nstrain and from 46.7% to 3.4% in the yellow strain.\"\n\n*Fruit Flies:*\n\"Dobzhansky and Pavlovsky (1971) reported a speciation event that occurred \nin a laboratory culture of Drosophila paulistorum sometime between 1958 and \n1963. The culture was descended from a single inseminated female that was \ncaptured in the Llanos of Colombia. In 1958 this strain produced fertile \nhybrids when crossed with conspecifics of different strains from Orinocan. \nFrom 1963 onward crosses with Orinocan strains produced only sterile males. \nInitially no assortative mating or behavioral isolation was seen between \nthe Llanos strain and the Orinocan strains. Later on Dobzhansky produced \nassortative mating (Dobzhansky 1972).\"\n\n\"Thoday and Gibson (1962) established a population of Drosophila \nmelanogaster from four gravid females. They applied selection on this \npopulation for flies with the highest and lowest numbers of sternoplural \nchaetae (hairs). In each generation, eight flies with high numbers of \nchaetae were allowed to interbreed and eight flies with low numbers of \nchaetae were allowed to interbreed. Periodically they performed mate choice \nexperiments on the two lines. They found that they had produced a high \ndegree of positive assortative mating between the two groups. In the decade \nor so following this, eighteen labs attempted unsuccessfully to reproduce \nthese results. References are given in Thoday and Gibson 1970.\"\n\n\"Crossley (1974) was able to produce changes in mating behavior in two \nmutant strains of D. melanogaster. Four treatments were used. In each \ntreatment, 55 virgin males and 55 virgin females of both ebony body mutant \nflies and vestigial wing mutant flies (220 flies total) were put into a jar \nand allowed to mate for 20 hours. The females were collected and each was \nput into a separate vial. The phenotypes of the offspring were recorded. \nWild type offspring were hybrids between the mutants. In two of the four \ntreatments, mating was carried out in the light. In one of these treatments \nall hybrid offspring were destroyed. This was repeated for 40 generations. \nMating was carried out in the dark in the other two treatments. Again, in \none of these all hybrids were destroyed. This was repeated for 49 \ngenerations. Crossley ran mate choice tests and observed mating behavior. \nPositive assortative mating was found in the treatment which had mated in \nthe light and had been subject to strong selection against hybridization. \nThe basis of this was changes in the courtship behaviors of both sexes. \nSimilar experiments, without observation of mating behavior, were performed \nby Knight, et. al. (1956).\"\n\n\"Kilias, et. al. (1980) exposed D. melanogaster populations to different \ntemperature and humidity regimes for several years. They performed mating \ntests to check for reproductive isolation. They found some sterility in \ncrosses among populations raised under different conditions. They also \nshowed some positive assortative mating. These things were not observed in \npopulations which were separated but raised under the same conditions. They \nconcluded that sexual isolation was produced as a byproduct of selection.\"\n\n\"In a series of papers (Rice 1985, Rice and Salt 1988 and Rice and Salt \n1990) Rice and Salt presented experimental evidence for the possiblility of \nsympatric speciation. They started from the premise that whenever organisms \nsort themselves into the environment first and then mate locally, \nindividuals with the same habitat preferences will necessarily mate \nassortatively. They established a stock population of D. melanogaster with \nflies collected in an orchard near Davis, California. Pupae from the \nculture were placed into a habitat maze. Newly emerged flies had to \nnegotiate the maze to find food. The maze simulated several environmental \ngradients simultaneously. The flies had to make three choices of which way \nto go. The first was between light and dark (phototaxis). The second was \nbetween up and down (geotaxis). The last was between the scent of \nacetaldehyde and the scent of ethanol (chemotaxis). This divided the flies \namong eight habitats. The flies were further divided by the time of day of \nemergence. In total the flies were divided among 24 spatio-temporal \nhabitats.\n\nThey next cultured two strains of flies that had chosen opposite habitats. \nOne strain emerged early, flew upward and was attracted to dark and \nacetaldehyde. The other emerged late, flew downward and was attracted to \nlight and ethanol. Pupae from these two strains were placed together in the \nmaze. They were allowed to mate at the food site and were collected. Eye \ncolor differences between the strains allowed Rice and Salt to distinguish \nbetween the two strains. A selective penalty was imposed on flies that \nswitched habitats. Females that switched habitats were destroyed. None of \ntheir gametes passed into the next generation. Males that switched habitats \nreceived no penalty. After 25 generations of this mating tests showed \nreproductive isolation between the two strains. Habitat specialization was \nalso produced.\n\nThey next repeated the experiment without the penalty against habitat \nswitching. The result was the same -- reproductive isolation was produced. \nThey argued that a switching penalty is not necessary to produce \nreproductive isolation. Their results, they stated, show the possibility of \nsympatric speciation.\"\n\n\"In a series of experiments, del Solar (1966) derived positively and \nnegatively geotactic and phototactic strains of D. pseudoobscura from the \nsame population by running the flies through mazes. Flies from different \nstrains were then introduced into mating chambers (10 males and 10 females \nfrom each strain). Matings were recorded. Significant positive assortative \nmating was found.\"\n\n\"The founder-flush (a.k.a. flush-crash) hypothesis posits that genetic \ndrift and founder effects play a major role in speciation (Powell 1978). \nDuring a founder-flush cycle a new habitat is colonized by a small number \nof individuals (e.g. one inseminated female). The population rapidly \nexpands (the flush phase). This is followed by the population crashing. \nDuring this crash period the population experiences strong genetic drift. \nThe population undergoes another rapid expansion followed by another crash. \nThis cycle repeats several times. Reproductive isolation is produced as a \nbyproduct of genetic drift.\n\nDood and Powell (1985) tested this hypothesis using D. pseudoobscura. A \nlarge, heterogenous population was allowed to grow rapidly in a very large \npopulation cage. Twelve experimental populations were derived from this \npopulation from single pair matings. These populations were allowed to \nflush. Fourteen months later, mating tests were performed among the twelve \npopulations. No postmating isolation was seen. One cross showed strong \nbehavioral isolation. The populations underwent three more flush-crash \ncycles. Forty-four months after the start of the experiment (and fifteen \nmonths after the last flush) the populations were again tested. Once again, \nno postmating isolation was seen. Three populations showed behavioral \nisolation in the form of positive assortative mating. Later tests between \n1980 and 1984 showed that the isolation persisted, though it was weaker in \nsome cases.\n\nGalina, et. al. (1993) performed similar experiments with D. pseudoobscura. \nMating tests between populations that underwent flush-crash cycles and \ntheir ancestral populations showed 8 cases of positive assortative mating \nout of 118 crosses. They also showed 5 cases of negative assortative mating \n(i.e. the flies preferred to mate with flies of the other strain). Tests \namong the founder-flush populations showed 36 cases of positive assortative \nmating out of 370 crosses. These tests also found 4 cases of negative \nassortative mating. Most of these mating preferences did not persist over \ntime. Galina, et. al. concluded that the founder-flush protocol yields \nreproductive isolation only as a rare and erratic event.\n\nAhearn (1980) applied the founder-flush protocol to D. silvestris. Flies \nfrom a line of this species underwent several flush-crash cycles. They were \ntested in mate choice experiments against flies from a continuously large \npopulation. Female flies from both strains preferred to mate with males \nfrom the large population. Females from the large population would not mate \nwith males from the founder flush population. An asymmetric reproductive \nisolation was produced.\n\nIn a three year experiment, Ringo, et. al. (1985) compared the effects of a \nfounder-flush protocol to the effects of selection on various traits. A \nlarge population of D. simulans was created from flies from 69 wild caught \nstocks from several locations. Founder-flush lines and selection lines were \nderived from this population. The founder-flush lines went through six \nflush-crash cycles. The selection lines experienced equal intensities of \nselection for various traits. Mating test were performed between strains \nwithin a treatment and between treatment strains and the source population. \nCrosses were also checked for postmating isolation. In the selection lines, \n10 out of 216 crosses showed positive assortative mating (2 crosses showed \nnegative assortative mating). They also found that 25 out of 216 crosses \nshowed postmating isolation. Of these, 9 cases involved crosses with the \nsource population. In the founder-flush lines 12 out of 216 crosses showed \npositive assortative mating (3 crosses showed negative assortative mating). \nPostmating isolation was found in 15 out of 216 crosses, 11 involving the \nsource population. They concluded that only weak isolation was found and \nthat there was little difference between the effects of natural selection \nand the effects of genetic drift.\"\n\n*House Flies:*\n\"Soans, et. al. (1974) used houseflies to test Pimentel's model of \nspeciation. This model posits that speciation requires two steps. The first \nis the formation of races in subpopulations. This is followed by the \nestablishment of reproductive isolation. Houseflies were subjected to \nintense divergent selection on the basis of positive and negative geotaxis. \nIn some treatments no gene flow was allowed, while in others there was 30% \ngene flow. Selection was imposed by placing 1000 flies into the center of a \n108 cm vertical tube. The first 50 flies that reached the top and the first \n50 flies that reached the bottom were used to found positively and \nnegatively geotactic populations.\"\n\n\"Halliburton and Gall (1981) established a population of flour beetles \ncollected in Davis, California. In each generation they selected the 8 \nlightest and the 8 heaviest pupae of each sex. When these 32 beetles had \nemerged, they were placed together and allowed to mate for 24 hours. Eggs \nwere collected for 48 hours. The pupae that developed from these eggs were \nweighed at 19 days. This was repeated for 15 generations. The results of \nmate choice tests between heavy and light beetles was compared to tests \namong control lines derived from randomly chosen pupae. Positive \nassortative mating on the basis of size wat found in 2 out of 4 \nexperimental lines.\"\n\n*Flour Beetles:*\n\"Halliburton and Gall (1981) established a population of flour beetles \ncollected in Davis, California.

These were allowed to grow \ninto a population of thousands of individuals. Four pairs from this \npopulation were transferred to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. For \nover 20 years these worms were used as test organisms in environmental \ntoxicology. From 1986 to 1991 the Long Beach area was searched for \npopulations of the worm. Two populations, P1 and P2, were found. Weinberg, \net. al. (1992) performed tests on these two populations and the Woods Hole \npopulation (WH) for both postmating and premating isolation. To test for \npostmating isolation, they looked at whether broods from crosses were \nsuccessfully reared. The results below give the percentage of successful \nrearings for each group of crosses.\nWH X WH 75% P1 X P2 77%\nP1 X P1 95% WH X P1 0%\nP2 X P2 80% WH X P2 0%\nThey also found statistically significant premating isolation between the \nWH population and the field populations. Finally, the Woods Hole population \nshowed slightly different karyotypes from the field populations.\"\n\n*Evolution is a fact.

Some mules are thirsty, most are not.

But they need to understand that science has been \nhijacked by a religion/political system and that there are alternate \nmotives at work.  One night I wrote   \u201cThe theory of evolution is clearly a \npolitical movement cloaking a religion disguised as science, enforced by an \nangry army, a great adversary of straw men.\u201d   I really liked it and \nthought I would get a lot of response or flak for it, but didn\u2019t.  \n  I have been discussing with Steve McRae a single point on this video and \nwas going crazy trying to get him debate logically.  He claims a very \ndistinguished alma matter, nuclear physics stuff, but he can\u2019t seem to do \nlinear logic.  I came to the conclusion that if Creationism is true it will \nprove its self (provided the science establishment isn\u2019t too corrupt).  I \nhave great faith that creationism will.  That the Spirit will work through \nme and truth will be found.  Now I am learning, people are saying, that \nscience doesn\u2019t mean truth, but that it is a best explanation for things. \n That it changes and evolves.  They have changed the meaning of science. \n But I have a secret weapons, Phillipians 4:13, and your prayers.  \n   By chance I met TV star Dog the bounty hunter Chapman and wife Beth a \nlittle while ago.  He busts criminals and prays with them on the way to \njail.  I told him \u201cGod Bless you and those you help.  I want to make a \ndifference too.\u201d  He just said, \u201cYou will, don\u2019t quit.\u201d  That was cool.\n   Well, I am rambling.  Need to study and get back to Steve McRae and show \nhim that radiometric dating does not work, I hope.\n   Was wanting to get a team together, an organized effort to logically \nopen hearts and minds to the truth.

chimps devolved and we evolved and that cant \nhappen according to you guys so why did one branch evolve and not the \nother? and kent hovind is in jail apparently for not paying taxes i dont \nsee how that makes him a cheat and a liar? personally taxes are bullshit \nthe government has no reason to be doing most of the stuff there are doing \nand the IRS, CIA and other organizations shouldn't even have any power what \nso ever. but anyways evolution is a religion and is not proven you can \nbelieve that if you want idc honestly. so if you wanna play the discredit \ngame on my people go ahead i dont play that game cause you have just as \nmany flaws in your religion and the people that back it up if not more than \nmine. so in the end you are ignorant and willingly stupid cause you dont \ntake the  time to see both sides clearly i have and i continue to do so \ncause it interests me a lot actually you all you do is just listen to what \npeople tell you and you believe it cause

After \nstudying the evolution/creation debate I switched to rejecting evolution \nand believing in design. I was super excited about it and studied it a lot \nfor several years. Now I am just apathetic and don't really get excited \nabout any theory of our existence. I basically am ok with the fact that I \ndon't know. But you seem to be very sure of yourself; however, the things \nyou write don't give a good foundation for being so sure.\n1. In this one you misconstrue evidence, fact, theory, and how these terms \nand ideas are used in science. There is evidence for the expansion of the \nuniverse. The expansion itself is not a scientific fact or law. It is a \ntheory. That doesn't mean it isn't true. The theory of the expansion of the \nuniverse is just the best overall idea that explains observations that have \nbeen made. Many of those observation themselves are reliant on assumptions. \nSo it is inaccurate to say, \"we know it happened because of the evidence.\" \nIt is more accurate to say, \"We have a theory that it happened until there \nis overwhelming evidence that our theory is incorrect.\" There is evidence \nagainst it and other theories about the nature of the universe. Take some \ntime to check them out. You may not believe them, or you may see that there \nalways seems to be some conflicting evidence about the expansion. So to sum \nit up regarding the big bang: We have many observations that we interpret \nin a particular way that supports an expanding universe. We take these \ninterpretations, along with other interpreted evidence and create a theory \nabout the big bang. That is a long way from saying that we KNOW the big \nbang happened.\n2. Here again you say, \"We know it happened because of the evidence.\" You \nagain misconstrue knowing things with having theories that seem to do a \ngood or a great job of explaining observations and interpretations of \nobservations. It is a fact that there is gravitational attraction between \nmatter. It is a fact that I am sitting in a chair. Macro-evolution is not \nthe same as these facts. Macro-evolution may well be true, but we don't \nKNOW that. And saying that breeding chihuahuas out of wolves doesn't \nprovide hard evidence for macro-evolution. Going from a wolf to a dog is \nWAY WAY different than going from nothing and getting a super-complex \ncreature like a dog. Perhaps you haven't studied biology, anatomy and \nphysiology, and molecular biology enough to understand the SUPER-complexity \nof life. But all that SUPER-complexity existed in the wolf. We just \nmanipulated the expression of genes to get to a dog. It is amazing the \nchanges we have made in the creature, but that manipulation didn't really \ncreate anything. It just selected some very interesting traits. Basically \nevery system in a living creature is necessary for its survival. That goes \nall the way down to each and every molecular structure and chemical \ncascade, up through all the thousands and thousands of super complex \nmolecular machines, up to the highly specialized tissues, up through the \nvery awesomely designed organs, up through the body systems, up to the \nentire creature and how everything is put together and operates together, \nand even up through how the creature interacts with the outside world \n(breeding, eating, finding shelter, its social habits, and everything else \nthat a creature or a population does to survive). Just 1 problem in any one \nof these things and the creature usually cannot live and reproduce. To say \nthat random point mutations in a gene code (that's assume how the super \nawesome and complex gene code and its operating mechanisms even got there \nin the first place) can create delicate complexity of this magnitude is a \nstretch beyond credibility. I understand the evidence for evolution. But \none must consider the counter-evidence as well. Tell me how a nephron \nevolved? or a juxtaglomerular apparatus (google it)?  These are \nmulti-faceted mechanisms that derive there function from interrelated, \ncomplex parts. That HAVE NO FUNCTION unless everything is in place and \nworking all at once. So how can a random point mutation create something \nlike that. And what came first, the the apparatus or the need for it. If \nthe need for it came first, the creature wouldn't survive, because the \nreason for its existence is to correct an imbalance that would quickly kill \nthe creature. The two apparatuses that I named here are only 2 parts of a \nkidney. There are many more of equal necessity and complexity in the kidney \nalone. And hundreds of thousands in the entire creature. Each needs to work \nnearly perfectly, all together, to have a living creature. All were \nexistent in the original wolf, and all are still there in modern/common \ndog. \n3. You're right about this one; but I think it was more of a joke.\n4. Again, your right about that as well.\n5. He is not completely off base about his analogy of natural selection to \nquality assurance in a factory. That analogy holds water, and it \ndemonstrates that a selection process only selects out the bad things to \nget rid of. It doesn't provide explanatory power for the creation of new \ndesigns. In evolutionary theory, the power for the new designs is credited \n(I think wrongly) to random point mutations in the gene code. That was the \nsupposed beauty of Darwin's theory. It took random changes (although he \ndidn't know the mechanism) and subjected it to selection. He thought that \nthat was the explanation of how life came to be as we see it today. But, we \nknow that selecting itself doesn't create anything. And I think that random \npoint mutations cannot account for the complexity we observe in nature. \n(Also, you can think about evolution in the abstract while excluding \nnatural selection. If random point mutation was creating anything, it would \noccur even without natural selection. The old things would still exist, but \na segment of the population would SUPPOSEDLY be changing into new things. \nThe natural selection molds and shapes the viable changes from the \navailable choices that mutations create, but the mutations are the key for \nproviding the choices or possibilities that the selections process can work \non. Its the same with the human/monkey question (if humans came from \nmonkeys, why are there still monkeys) All the monkey like creatures didn't \nhave to be selected out for the humans to evolve up the ladder (I realize \nevolution isn't necessarily an UPWARD movement). The same goes for all the \nother natural selection that didn't have to occur for other creatures to \nhave emerged. Natural selection supposedly did shape and select what we see \ntoday.

Libby \nestimated that the radioactivity of exchangeable carbon-14 would be about \n14 disintegrations per minute (dpm) per gram of pure carbon, and this is \nstill used as the activity of the modern radiocarbon standard.[8][9] In \n1960, Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for this work.\nOne of the frequent uses of the technique is to date organic remains from \narchaeological sites. Plants fix atmospheric carbon during photosynthesis, \nso the level of 14C in plants and animals when they die approximately \nequals the level of 14C in the atmosphere at that time. However, it \ndecreases thereafter from radioactive decay, allowing the date of death or \nfixation to be estimated. The initial 14C level for the calculation can \neither be estimated, or else directly compared with known year-by-year data \nfrom tree-ring data (dendrochronology) up to 10,000 years ago (using \noverlapping data from live and dead trees in a given area), or else from \ncave deposits (speleothems), back to about 45,000 years before the present. \nA calculation or (more accurately) a direct comparison of carbon-14 levels \nin a sample, with tree ring or cave-deposit carbon-14 levels of a known \nage, then gives the wood or animal sample age-since-formation."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm_GKJtaiPQscw8Bqlls6Hg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "sgtdavid primary", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12bzpmpiqnsh5ac423sjh3hsn3dsztkh", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-09T23:22:00.774Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCm_GKJtaiPQscw8Bqlls6Hg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.25140800000000002, "formal_score": 92, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-09T23:22:00.774Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8WBciGoqerw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/x6CfeEyCWYA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114485347882202340474", "textDisplay": "+bollo3000\neven for radiometric dating, they cannot know how much carbon-14 was in the \ncreature when it died, or if there were things that changed the decay rate \nand the amount in the organsim."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm_GKJtaiPQscw8Bqlls6Hg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "sgtdavid primary", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12bzpmpiqnsh5ac423sjh3hsn3dsztkh", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-09T23:21:00.820Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCm_GKJtaiPQscw8Bqlls6Hg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.10735999999999996, "formal_score": 7, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-09T23:21:00.820Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8WBciGoqerw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/x6CfeEyCWYA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114485347882202340474", "textDisplay": "+bollo3000\njust because it's popular, that doesn't make it right.

The \nfossil record didn't support evolution of species to other species, let \nalone taxa, in Darwin's time.

Geology assuredly does not reveal any such \nfinely-graduated organic chain; and this is the most obvious and serious \nobjection which can be urged against the theory.\"\n\nAnd the situation hasn't changed since then, one of the most prominent \nevolutionists Stephen Jay Gould said:\n\n\"The extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as \nthe trade secret of paleontology.\"\n\nYes, there are a few alleged examples of transitional fossils but they are \nhighly questionable, and the biggest problem is that we should have \nmillions, if not billions of transitional fossils between species and taxa \nnow that billions of fossils have been found.\n\nThe fossil record we have is basically like this: a large group of fossils \nof similar species > a wide gap > another large group of fossils of similar \nspecies > another wide gap... etc., i.e. there are no transitional fossils \nbetween taxa. So how on earth does the fossil record evolutionist claims of \nspecies evolving to other taxa? Well, it doesn't, and Gould like his fellow \npaleontologists knew this very well and he was the one who came up with the \npurely speculative theory of \"punctuated equilibrium\".\n\nLike I said, beliefs and assumptions, and if the evolutionists were real \nsciencists they would try the come up with a completely new theory that the \nfossil record actually supported. But they are just trying to force the \nevidence to fit their theory when it should be the other way around.\n\nAs to what I'd get in class for this: who gives a fuck what a brainwashed \nmoron who calls himself a biology teacher and preaches about evolution \nwould give.
