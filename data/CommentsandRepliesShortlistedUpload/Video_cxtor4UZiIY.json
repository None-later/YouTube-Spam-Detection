In \nregards to what they're planning to do in the UK, well, that's not really \nmy concern.\nWhat happens in the EU, that's my concern and UKIP is right!\n20 years ago, Portugal was a nice place to live in. It was so nice that my \nparents decided to leave BRAZIL and start a business in Portugal, that was \n1991.\nWe thrived and by 2006 we had a lot of emplyees and most of our family \nmembers taken care of. After that, with increasings on Taxition, exorbitant \nincreases bytheway, things went deep south.\nWe were forced to lay off people and reduce the wages of the ones who \nremained working with us. Many others small/med business did the same. At \nthe same time people were losing jobs and as a result internal consumptions \ndropped not even joking 60%! We struggle to pay electricity bills on a \n100m2 business - averaging \u20ac2k a month only in electricity.\nOn top of it, having a weak internal economy, plus higher taxation, we are \nleft with more expenses and less clients. GOOD JOB! So much for your \nEconomics Major.\nSmall/med business are the most important facton on a country's economy.\nYou can have 100 McDonalds employing 5k poeple at minimum wage, but that \nwill never be enough compared to having 5k small restaurants emplying 50k \npeople with better wages that I KNOW it's possible.\nMy parents were paying \u20ac1.5k on average to his employees. The national \nminimum wage is 500\u20ac. That isn't even enought to pay rent for a decent \nhome. Not to mention people have to eat, move about, obligatory insurances, \neducation and health - not to mention leisure.\nI am an immigrant, but immigrants who had something to build, not simply \nafter a better wage. For those who studied the fundamentals of economics \nknow by fact that uncontrolled immigration only leads to drop in wages, \nsocial unrest and a slight tendency to increase nationalism and hate \nspeeches. Which is only good for big business - cheap work force! For the \nrest of us, not really.\nYou Mr. Brand are a privileged person, most of political decisions don't \ninfluence you directly as you might think. Money gives you that leverage, \njust like my family. If taxation went up we simply pay that extra and move \non.\nNow try doing that with a 500\u20ac monthly wage. Just try.\nOn that panorame, you Sir, would be probably playing guitar in the \nunderground for a few coins so you could pay for your children's dipers.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13eg1rw1snrdhjjk04cexq50uqwfjaot0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEv1frOe9G1dcc6SsdFDhLg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uFoV3BSCuHQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFo/GjxiXS2K8HY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "seigneurterrasse", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-07T21:11:37.284Z", "videoId": "cxtor4UZiIY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEv1frOe9G1dcc6SsdFDhLg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.18618000000000001, "formal_score": 52, "updatedAt": "2014-12-07T21:11:37.284Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107382487868408573492", "textDisplay": "\"He ain't half loud in he\"!\nTHIS IS RICH coming from you Russell Brand!!

I \nwould therefore ask that you try to be more responsible in your analysis. \nOpen your mind, consider alternative viewpoints and crucially, look to a \nvariety of sources for your information. If you do, you will see that we \nare heading towards a United States of Europe \u2013 there is no doubt about it. \nEven our esteemed war leader Winston Churchill called for it in 1955 (you \ncan listen to his speech on YouTube). This of course is fine though if that \nis what you want. But, most of us have not asked for it and do not want it! \n\nSadly, it seems that most people of our age have forgotten what took place \nduring our grandparent's lifetimes, but we should not forget. Those who \nwant a USE are trying to rewrite history, but the truth is: many of our \ngrandparents gave their lives to secure our independence. Sure, there are \nsome issues better tackled together, but we don't need to be relegated to a \nmere province of a undemocratic super state to work together. Is there a \nclambering do you think among Canadians to join the United States of \nAmerica? Does Mexico want to become the 51st state of the USA? No, of \ncourse not, yet all three countries trade together and cooperate across a \nwhole range of areas. What about New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Samoa etc? \nDo they want to be part of one country? No, but again, they cooperate and \nare friendly and non belligerent neighbours. \n\nAnother key thing you seem to be happy to overlook is that the EU is \nfundamentally fascist in its approach. Don\u2019t believe me, do some reading \nand find out for yourself. \n\nIt spends \u00a3billions on its own propaganda. Notice the EU flag on nearly \nevery building project in the UK? Of course the EU is funding this \ndevelopment right? Wrong! We are a net contributor to the EU. That means \nthat any \u2018EU money\u2019 spent in the UK is actually just (some) of our money \nbeing given back (and with strings attached for that matter). Yet for this \n\u2018privilege\u2019 we are made to feel grateful. Can anyone else think of another \nregime which embedded propaganda at the centre of the state? I\u2019ll leave you \nponder that one.\n\nWhat about education? Do you know the EU have developed qualifications all \naround Europe (such as the Welsh Baccalaureate in Wales) which schools are \nthen paid to deliver. They teach school children about things like \ncitizenship \u2013 European citizenship that is. British history is not taught, \nbut the EU vision is. They don\u2019t learn about British culture, but they \nlearn about \u2018European\u2019 culture. The aim is to indoctrinate young people, so \nby the time they leave school, they know nothing about our own history, \nculture and values. Can anybody else think of a regime which controlled \nwhat school children learned, so they could control what they thought? \n\nWhat about the fact that it is run by an incestuous bureaucracy who most of \nus have never heard of? Surely it is a pretty important element of \ndemocracy that you know who your leaders are? Many of the people who make \nthe decisions that affect us every day cannot speak our language, and would \nnot know Cardiff from Swansea. They don\u2019t understand our history, our \nculture or our way of life. And neither do they care.\n\nRemember Nick Clegg saying during the TV debates that what Nigel said about \na European Air Force was \u201call fantasy\u2026just not true\u201d. Well take a look at \nthe minutes of the Council of Ministers of December 2013. You will see \nquite clearly that this was proposed. But, because members had to reach \nunanimity, the motion was not carried. Meanwhile, because of changes that \ncome into force on November the 1st, the members who proposed it (led by \nGermany) can, and will, resurrect their proposal. And even without formal \nauthority, they are laying the foundations anyway. Just to a bit of \ngoogling!\n\nAs you seem to have a real bee in your bonnet over immigration, let me ask \nyou: \n\nDo you believe in the principle of a contribution based healthcare system? \nOr do you think that anyone should be able to come here and use the NHS for \nfree? Because if you believe in the latter, I would appreciate your plans \nfor how this Utopian system is to be funded. Will doctors and nurses be \npaid in this system, or will they all be volunteers in \u2018the big society\u2019, \nlike library staff and leisure centre workers?\n\nDo you believe that waiting times should be as short as possible? If so, \ncan you tell me how a GP can give assurances to see their patients within a \ndecent amount of time if their surgery is geared up to serve a 10,000 \npeople, when suddenly there are 11,000 people living in that same village? \nDo you think it\u2019s right that 90 year old people who have lived, worked and \ncontributed to this country are waiting weeks for a GP\u2019s appointment, \ninstead of days?\n\nWhat about schools? Do you think class sizes have to increase when more \npeople move into a town or city? Or do they shrink? As we have to make more \nand more cuts in the public sector, will we have more teachers or less? \n\nWhat about community? Do you think it\u2019s a good thing that schools now have \nto employ interpreters for school PTA meetings? Is that a good use of \nfunds, or would you rather those funds paid for an extra district nurse so \nyour aging family can get better healthcare?\n\nWhat about housing? If we build on our green spaces they will be gone \nforever. Are you happy that your children may eventually live in a world \nwhere going for a walk in a field will only be something you can do using a \nvirtual reality headset on your Xbox? Does bulldozing forests to build \nhouses reduce the amount of Co2 in the atmosphere? No, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it \nmakes things worse.\n\nWhat about food? Does a larger population mean less pressure on food \nsupply? Of course not, it means greater pressures. But that\u2019s okay isn\u2019t it \n\u2013 we can always increase supply? Oh yes I forgot, there\u2019s a problem with \nthat. I just remembered we have built on all of our fields; there is now \nnowhere to grow our food. That\u2019s a shame; we will can bring back rationing. \n\nWhat about law and order? It can be easy to take our liberties for granted. \nIt must be, because we do. But do you know that because of Magna Carta, \nbecause of habeas corpus and the Bill of Rights (YES PEOPLE, WE DO HAVE \nONE). It was passed in 1689, exactly 100 years before the USA passed their \nown into law, and about 300 years before we were forced to adopt a European \nversion! \n\nAnyway, we have some long established principles in our legal system. I \nsuppose they are not that important really. We just have things like trial \nby jury, so the state can\u2019t simply lock us up and throw away the key \nbecause it wants to. And other small things like being considered innocent \nuntil proven guilty, placing the burden to prove guilt on the state and not \nasking the accused to prove their innocence. Well, on the continent they \nhave a slightly different system. These safeguards against tyranny don\u2019t \nexist, and soon they won\u2019t exist here. The European Union have established \na European Prosecutor who can order national judges to issue arrest \nwarrants. Our lay magistrates (who are our peers) are slowly being replaced \nby paid judges (like on the continent).

I don't think just because someone's rich they \ncan't care about the poor and Farage was a trader, not a banker. He had a \ngood job, what's the problem?

When Maria Miller was caught \nstealing 100,000 from the taxpayer, David Cameron supported her on TV.

I'm sorry but \ncalling people nasty names because they hold a different point of view to \nyou is a bit childish and intolerant actually. And using the word racist as \na way to scaremonger people away from UKIP is disgusting. I'm quarter \nPolish myself, I've been to Auschwitz and found a picture of a distant \nrelative that was murdered there, I know what real racism and fascism is. \nPeople who use the word Fascist and Racist flagrantly or for a political \nagenda should be ashamed of yourselves.

The Tories are promising a referendum on this so if the \nmajority of people want out they can in 2017. If you think that this is the \nmagic solution to all of life\u2019s problems then you can vote for them in 2015 \nand you can have your referendum then. Until then you will have to put up \nwith it. Can you actually name one European law which has had a detrimental \neffect on you personally ? Not all laws which are passed are bad. Would you \nvote against seatbelts if it came from Brussels on principles ? A piece of \nlegislation which saves lives would not be worth it because your principles \nwould be offended. UKIP have actually voted against legislation which would \nhelp people but hey that doesn\u2019t matter because it was passed by faceless \nbureaucrats. Now you tell me \u201cwhat the fuck is all that about?\u201d The Human \nRights Act ? That\u2019s really bad isn\u2019t it, having a right to freedom from \ntorture ? If you knew anything about the law you would know that anyone in \nthis country could apply to the European court since the 1960s. All the \nHuman Rights act did was to speed up the process, by putting it on the \nstatute books. The European Convention on Human Rights which was the basis \nfor the human rights act came about in the aftermath of world war 2. The \npeople who fought in world war 2 not just Britain but soldiers from the \nBritish Empire in Africa and India fought for human rights. The EU came \nabout to make sure that there wasn\u2019t the possibility of any future despot \nlike Hitler emerging. Even Churchill supported the European Union. Why not \ntry and read some proper history ? Labour don\u2019t want out because they know \nit would make this country poorer-fact immigration has made this country \nricher-fact we live in a globalized world where power is determined not by \nthe country but the economic bloc that you are in. The only countries which \nmatter will be those which are big enough to be an economic bloc in their \nown right like China. China and the US don\u2019t want the UK to pull out \nbecause they know that the UK is the access point for the valuable European \nmarket. You might want some country which is poorer and full of white men \nwho look like Nigel Farage. I don\u2019t, and that does not make me \nun-patriotic.

This is the greatest theft of all.\nIn Spain in the 1930's prior to Franco's invasion the collectivized \nindustries there seemed to do pretty well. Productivity actually increased \nin some areas.

My point about the airplane is that the pilot is the only \nperson who has the experience and knowledge of how to fly a plane.

In my humble opinion, people need to stop being so sensitive to \nthe whole border control thing (which should still be decided by us in any \ncase) and wake up to what the EU really means. The UK electorate making \ndecisions about issues in the UK IS NOT RACIST lol. If we all vote and \ndecide to have an open border then that's great.

This video demonstrated \nconclusively that Brand has no knowledge or interest in politics or in the \nEuropean Union as well as arguments in favor or against it. Rather than \ncriticize or expose Farage Brand simply mocked his voice or a couple of \nwords and made childish jibes he clearly thinks are clever such as \"you \ncome from Europe, Nigel \".\n\nBrand reiterates some college student boilerplate that it is corporations \nand banks that are causing problems and not immigrants. Because Brand lives \nin a Mickey Mouse world where he believes these issues are all separate \nfrom each other he refuses to accept immigration is an issue. I think \n\"Corporations and Big Banks\" are bad as well as they are the people who are \nalso responsible for the immigration problems.

You have just beautifully demonstrated exactly how \nlefties get their point across; not by arguing such points, of which Mr \nFarage has many, but by ridiculing and name calling anyone who doesn't \nagree with you.  You have nothing to say in this video other than a bunch \nof cheap, unfunny jibes about Nigel's personality. How about you actually \nwatch some of his videos and address the points he makes?\n\nI do appreciate that on the planet Russell Brand with your big house and \nyour millions in the bank that things are rosy and immigration is a \nwonderful thing, and I'm sorry to burst your bubble here, but on the ground \nhere in real world, the reality is somewhat different.  I know you are big \non modern communism where we should all share, but unfortunately in this \nbig world, we are only a small Island with limited resources and the areas \nthat have become heavily populated by immigrants have not changed for the \nbetter, which is why we have seen so much white flight as a result of the \ntension of living in increasingly divided communities because of an influx \nof people who are not the slightest bit interested in integrating into \nBritish society.  It would be great if people from different cultures could \nlive side by side in perfect harmony, but unfortunately, we humans by our \nvery nature are too addicted to our identities, and when you force an idea \nsuch as multiculturalism onto a species that is not evolved enough to \nhandle such a concept, conflict is an inevitable consequence that no amount \nof hate crime legislation can ever stop.  This is actually the main point \nNigel Farage is making in his argument against immigration.\n\nYou see Russell, I do know what is going on because I live right in the \nheart of it and I also speak to people in this area who also tell me the \nsame thing.  In fact it's somewhat of an irony that the people who tell me \nmost how sick to the back teeth they are of the excessive immigration of \nlate are blacks and Asians.  Are they racist as well? \n\nSo as you have no problems with the current, ridiculous levels of \nimmigration into the UK and think it is quite acceptable that the British \npeople should have to accept a reduced standard of living as a result, or \n'sharing', as you like to call it, how about you join us in that sharing, \nafter all, as David Cameron once said, 'we're all in it together'.  So come \non then Russell, you have a big house and more millions than you could ever \nneed; let\u2019s see you open your home to some of these immigrants who are no \ndoubt desperate for somewhere to live whilst you\u2019ve been lounging around in \nthe lap of luxury. Let\u2019s see you share your millions with the less well \noff. Let\u2019s see you practice what you preach.  Oh sorry I forgot, it is as \nyou have complained about many times; one rule for the rich and another for \nthe poor.

I will not have much opposition within the party. It is, of \ncourse, not just this video which needs banning; all teaching of global \nwarming being caused in any way by carbon dioxide emissions must also be \nbanned. It just is not happening.\u201d\n\n\"Just 2.6 per cent of those who die every year pay inheritance tax. The \naverage taxpaying estate is worth \u00a3875,000, according to HMRC. Inheritance \ntax raises \u00a32.9bn a year for the Treasury from some of the wealthiest \npeople in the country, while estates worth less than \u00a3325,000 don\u2019t pay a \npenny.\nAnd yet UKIP wants to abolish it completely.\nAt a time of rising inequality, redistributive policies such as inheritance \ntax are a symbolic bulwark against US-levels of inequality. In this \nrespect, UKIP policy panders to the 2.6 per cent of the population who have \nsome of the biggest estates in Britain.

I think Russell is a \nlittle bit of a cunt, and also a bit racist. I believe he is bigoted and \nhateful when it comes to white, native Britons. He thinks that we have no \nright to preserve our culture or historical customs and must give them up \nin the name of \"community cohesion\". Which means every ethnicity, religion, \nculture must be protected, celebrated and respected. Except white, English \nculture...which he, and his guilt ridden, traitorous lefty friends, think \nis evil. Colonial, brutal, land stealing devils. His own white skin and \nnationality an embarrassment to him. Something he wants to apologize for at \never turn. That he thinks this will be best for Britain is mind boggling. \nBut the people who say no...no we are the native peoples, we are the first, \nthe last and you must assimilate and abide by our customs and the rule of \nlaw or you should leave. But he would say that is racist. Yet going to \nanother country and abiding by their customs and laws would be to Russell \nthe height of good manners and human decency. If i went to Saudi Arabia and \ntook my bird with me in a bikini, striding through downtown Riyadh half \nnaked with her bum hanging out while I drink from a bottle of Vodka I would \nknow what to expect. The assumption bring that when in Saudi do as the \nSaudis do...but when in Britain it is also do as the Saudis do. It is \nbollocks and it won't last. No bullshit about traditions of tolerance and \nJewish refugees or the Hugenout, they came, assimilated and within a \ngeneration were indistinguishable. But more immigrants have arrived here \nlegally or in the back of a lorry just THIS YEAR than arrived in all those \nhistorical incidents. That is not doing your bit, helping a few and \nmaintaining our way of life...that is the wholesale importation of 3 \nmillion barely literate, mostly Muslim third world people who don't want to \nassimilate, who actually now, a generation or two later hate us, who \npractice honour killing, roam in rape gangs brutalizing and attacking white \nEnglish girls and are breeding like locusts. A tipping point is coming in \nEngland, in the North or East London. I hope it kicks off a chain of events \nthat ends with the inevitable. The simple, uncomfortable truth that the \nleft don't or won't accept is that Islam and English customs, law and order \netc...cannot live in mutual harmony. Islam makes it impossible. It is \ninevitable that when there are enough of them they will rebel, refuse to \nrecognize English law and a line will have been crossed. In Iraq, Syria. \nEgypt, Africa (East. West, Sub Saharan) and many other places Muslim that \nhave lived with Christians for centuries have turned on them. So don't \nthink if you have Muslim friends they will put you before their God, their \npeadophile prophet or the will of the extremists among them. The only \nchoice we have, as unpleasant as it is, forced on us by Labour treason and \nlefty calibration, will be to strike soon. Strike before we are the fucking \nminority. My family have been here in one way or another since 1570. I am \nan Englishman and this is my home. We will fight in battle, like our \nwarrior ancestors did, fight and die if necessary. But we will never, ever, \nlet a bunch of disrespectful, illiterate cousin fucking, child molester \nworshipping savages steal our land from under our feet. Not a fucking \nchance. So bring it on, start the fire and lets just get this out the way. \nProper people know it is inevitable so why wait. Only left wing traitors \nthink it is knee jerk fear mongering, a fairy tale or secretly want it to \nhappen so the third world can govern the first.

This money will come from cutting \noff links to the EU apparently, but your taxes will still be the same. \n\nThey aren't increasing the public sector - UKIP are following the \nneoliberal path by planning to privatise the NHS and will reduce benefits, \nwhich affect the working class more then the middle and upper classes. \n\nSo in reality all UKIP are doing are swapping one thing for another.

I do realise that many celebrities, \nbusiness people, politicians, are very invested in the EU's morals, rather \nthan being more interested in the welfare of the people of this country, \nwho ironically, by the way, buy your DVD's etc. I'd be careful of \nostracising an increasing amount of people, for the sake of mouthing off \nfor a few minutes.\n\nThere seems to be an attitude of 'he won't get to be PM, so we can say what \nwe like' ... he is very modest himself, but he IS steadily becoming more \ninfluential, and I think he would be a brilliant PM and, for the first time \nin years, am actually interested in politics and can feel big change \nbeginning to come in, which will be exciting to witness and be part of in \nthe lead up to the election next year.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z122z3sztzqtw34hl04cdxvahoqvjhqqgw00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 51, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Q2tqZ683WKvQQHzr44CqA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.2345679012345678, "authorDisplayName": "Treyb3yond", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-10T11:24:59.632Z", "videoId": "cxtor4UZiIY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC2Q2tqZ683WKvQQHzr44CqA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.15397400000000006, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-07-10T11:29:46.000Z", "likeCount": 70, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114145885230841498166", "textDisplay": "Brand, you're a bit out of touch mate.

It's convenient for you to ignore or change what I've said to \nsimplify the issues I raise and not have to answer them. For example I \nnoted earlier that even some of the comments I've had on this thread have \nbeen prejudiced against me, but you ignored that and all their comments and \ninstead kept saying I had no evidence. Interesting. UKIP are a racist party \nbecause racism is when one race is considered to be superior to another \nrace. UKIP say they do not believe this (''we only want the best \nimmigrants!\") but actually the things their candidates and some of their \nmembers say belie that claim. A typical example would be the 'Romanians v \nGermans' comment made by Farage. That, despite what his fans say, is \nactually racist. It is the implication that one race (in this case the \nGermans) are superior to another race (the Romanians). It's based on \nstereotype (Germans= efficient, nice white people/ Romanians= Romany, \nthieves, poor, unpleasant.) So, that is why I say individual Kippers may \nnot be racist, but it is a racist party. And before you repeat 'but one \nperson doesn't represent us all!!\" again, I say again, UKIP is a *racist \nparty* but that is not to say all (or even a majority of)  Kippers are \nracists.\nFinally, the last evidence you need of this is the fact that UKIP attracts \nso many racists (all the nutcases you guys are always having to boot out \ndue to media shaming) and other racist, right wing groups in europe. (An \nexample of this in terms of groups- as finding normal members of UKIP whore \nare racist but not in the public eye is too difficult and tedious a job- \nwould be Le Pen. Farage isn't aligning himself with her, but joined groups \njust like hers anyway(but less notorious) and even if he genuinely finds \nher politics disgusting, she herself is flummxed as she says they have very \nsimilar goals and beliefs. So, even if you do not like Le Pen, it's an \nexample of how racists are attracted to UKIP, and you have to ask yourself \nwhy http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27071002 ) No other party has to \nban people from the BNP, no other party has to repeatedly announce that \nit's not racist. This is because UKIP, being a racist party, ends up \nattracted racist people. I'm sure a lot of people vote for UKIP because \nthey are fed up with the current government, or because of immigration, or \nbecause they are eurosceptic (all of which is fine and I actually \nsympathise and agree with myself) but there are other, less recist parties \nout there that are the same (i.e. No2EU or even the Green Party believe it \nor not.)"}}, {"snippet":

By \"bigger picture\" I mean things like nation states and \ncorporations. Things that are fundamental to our way of life - even if you \ndon't think they should be. It's worth knowing about those things, but you \nhave to be realistic about the fact that they're not going to disappear \nanytime soon (I'm not saying I want them to disappear, but it wouldn't \nmatter if I did or didn't).\n\nBy \"small victories\" I mean any victory for a political cause that could be \ndescribed as \"progressive\" (another vague term). Any political campaign \nthat is based on something like the kind of philosophy you've been \npromoting - compassion, etc.\n\nGay marriage is a good example of something that would be a small victory. \nThe decision by parliament not to go into Syria is probably another \nexample (which was probably caused by the dissent over Iraq). There was a \ncampaign in America recently to get McDonalds to pay a living wage to their \nworkers. Their full-time workers were (probably still are) having to get \ngovernment benefits because their wages weren't sufficient to live on. I \ndon't know if that campaign was successful, but if it was it would be a \ngood example of what I mean by a small victory.\n\nThere needs to be political campaigns - many at one time and of various \ntypes - because no society is perfect. Also society is in constant flux so \nthere has to be constant adaptation. When there is no protest you're \nlooking at an authoritarian government.\n\nI'm not anti-capitalist. It's just that the drives that make capitalism a \nviable economic system tend to get out of hand and if you're not careful a \ncountry can become immersed in greed and competition, with no other values \ngetting any recognition. Like 19th century Britain with the laissez-faire \nphilosophy. Dickens tried to point that out - and he had some success. It's \na question of balance.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with starting a business and making profit. Some \npeople take to that naturally, just like you take to comedy naturally and I \ntake to philosophy, etc. The problem starts when the businessman, for \ninstance, thinks that everything should be pushed aside to make way for his \ndesire for more and more money. Maybe that's his nature, but then the \nanswer is to have a counterbalance that he can't push aside - strong \ngovernment for instance.\n\nBut you don't want to make the same mistake he makes by trying to make \nsociety conform totally to your particular personality.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z130yb5rexbktbwio04ch1lhnrnkctsh1v00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfUvxeTiEy0CyVIKcWj3zdw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MrSputnicone", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-23T23:23:48.582Z", "videoId": "cxtor4UZiIY", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfUvxeTiEy0CyVIKcWj3zdw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.92381190000000002, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-07-23T23:23:48.582Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106513253749616585292", "textDisplay": "You need to look up the word Ironic, Brand.
