It does \nnot make sense and I have no time to explain this to you. It\u2019s just one of \nthose offhand comments I\u2019ve spent time trying to dissuade Obama bashers to \navoid. It makes them look so much in a hurry to throw whatever garbage they \ncan find to buttress their points. But I\u2019m a bit confused by your assertion \nthat there was economic growth at all under Obama. Own goal!\n\nMy source says the top 1% of US earners collected 19.3% of household \nincome, breaking a record previously set in 1927. It also goes to say that \nincome inequality in the US has been growing for almost three decades \u2013 not \nthree years. This has become an issue, and a stick by which you beat your \npresident because he\u2019s been concerned about the issue unlike previous govt. \nHe\u2019s genuinely pointing at the dangers this will become and the need for \nAmerica and indeed the world to agree on a way forward.\n\nStrangely the Republicans are against doing anything about the issue. Read: \n\u201cAccording to new poll by the Pew Research Centre and USA Today, 65% of \nAmericans believe inequality has grown in the past decade, but partisan \ndivides are clear. Ninety (90%) percent of Democrats think the government \nshould take steps to reduce the income gap, compared to only 45% of \nRepublicans\u201d. There you have it. You see why it\u2019s hypocritical for \nRepublicans to come on hear and take turns to insult him.\n\nGladly, I\u2019m from the UK and I can categorically tell you that we have \nmassive income inequality to the point that over the past 30 years, income \ninequality in the UK has grown at an alarming rate. And we are one of the \nmost unequal countries in the world today. We have more part-time jobs than \nfull time. So the reduction in unemployment in UK (that you may have heard) \nis due to people sharing jobs on minimum wages and not real jobs. Again, we \nhave what is known as working poor. Where workers have to use social \nsecurity to supplement their income. We literally work to pay debts and \nbills and most low paid and medium income earners have never had any pay \nrise for over 5 years!\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s something about capitalism that needs sorting. Of course, \nif Obama says that, he\u2019s labelled a socialist. So I can happily speak on \nhis behalf.\n\nFormer US Secretary of Labour Robert Reich, recently said, \u201cAs wealth \nbecomes more concentrated in the hands of the few, their political power \ngrows, drowning out the voices of average Americans, filling the campaign \nchests of candidates who will do their bidding, financing attacks on \norganized labor, and bankrolling a vast empire of right-wing think-tanks \nand publicists that fill the airwaves with half-truths and distortions.\"\n\nTo illustrate this further, if you recall the Koch brothers (of Russia root \n\u2013 socialists), you will realize that they fund organizations advocating \nlower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services and less \noversight of industry - in particular environmental regulation. They \nactively fund and support organizations that contribute significantly to \nRepublican candidates, and that lobby against universal health care and \nclimate change legislations.\n\nMy friend, redistribution of wealth that you claim to be underway as if \nit\u2019s another Obama\u2019s project is a misnomer. This has been ongoing for over \n30 years. After the world war, it stabilized and then took off years after. \nOur own was made worse by a conservative govt of Maggi Thatcher  from 1979.\n\nI understand your comment and facts. But I think they are cooked up to \nsupport your dislike and hatred of that one man and not what\u2019s actually \ngoing on. Unless you really believe Obama has ruined your country. The \nworld faced financial ruin. It\u2019s common sense to appreciate that the \npoorest will suffer the most. The influenza originated from your country \nand so its\u2019 equally true you feel the full force of it.\n\nAs you rightly pointed out stock price, corporate growth and currency \ntrading are getting ahead because the world economy is still fragile. Money \nfloated out to banks is to help kick start the economy - so you see stock \nexchange etc doing well. Gambling as always. Real jobs are not there and \nthe few ones are being shrunk by office/industrial automation leaving \nyoungsters with uncertain future.  The situation of inequality has been \nongoing and getting worse with tech advancement. It serves the rich since \nthey don\u2019t have to hire you or me at a great cost to them.\n\nObama is only stating the obvious and doing something about it. \nUnfortunately you have a divided house that has only one interest \u2013 the 1 \nto 10% of that income divide to which they belong.\n\nPerhaps use of executive powers will push the issue. But then you'll call \nhim a dictator. I think his enemies evade the fundamental facts of income \ninequality by shifting the argument to suit their opinion of Obama.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in your comment about inequality that is new. They have \nalready been said, both pre and post 1917, 1929 & 1933 to date. It has been \ngetting worse. Obama has seen that it\u2019s become the status quo and trying to \ntip the balance with the support of ordinary Americans.  Unfortunately, \nthey\u2019re still hypnotised by previous govts.\n\nYou and the rest of the world must wake up to the uncertain future that \nmay get worse both climatically and socially/economically. Obama has just \nthis term to give you back your FREEDOM, but we have very long years ahead \nto suffer what is to come. The financial crisis is a tip of the iceberg.\n\nThese things are the outcome of unregulated human greed which capitalism \nhas engendered since the industrial revolution in Britain, and not just a \npolitician.  I tell you,  the birth of Town planning laws, local govts, \nUniversal health care, housing etc in the UK are all the off shoot of the \nproblems of inequality that resulted from industrial revolution. They were \ncreated to tackle the potential crisis of inequality. With better \ntechnologies, we increasingly lose the fight against the machines with our \njobs. We just have to fine tune capitalism a bit.\n\nClimate change has now gone into the mix. The consequences of extreme greed \nand climatic changes are no respecter of any political party or president. \nIt'll just match on and consume the rest of us while we're busy bickering.\n\nI will come back to the rest of your comments. For now, I have a paid job \nto go to."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCERbiDP1Hkoppmjk9losWoA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "EmperorJBO", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13wstvqplzovjsja04cjz2bisesvl2adyw0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-13T09:02:18.007Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCERbiDP1Hkoppmjk9losWoA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.24218800000000001, "formal_score": 97, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-13T09:02:18.007Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106934925899800740812", "textDisplay": "+Chris West he doesn't really tell the whole truth.

But if you adjust the \nrate for the massive taxation the government does and the redistribution of \nwealth already underway, income equality is the same as it was in 1987. \nIt\u2019s pretty easy to make the case that the only reason Obama pretends it\u2019s \na sudden crime that needs to be addressed right now is that Obamacare is \nsuch a disaster that needs to be ignored.\n\n2) Raising minimum wage will help families\nObama sayeth, \u201c[We] have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to \n$10.10\u2026 This will help families. It will give businesses customers with \nmore money to spend\u2026 So join the rest of the country. Say yes. Give America \na raise.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not hard to believe that Obama, who has never run a business, doesn\u2019t \nunderstand that artificially forcing a business to pay someone more than \ntheir wage is worth will put more people out of the labor market. Making \njob creation more expensive leads to fewer jobs.\n\n3) His minimum wage hike for federal workers brings immediate relief\nObama sayeth, \u201cIn the coming weeks, I will issue an executive order \nrequiring federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a \nfair wage of at least $10.10 an hour, because if you cook our troops\u2019 meals \nor wash their dishes, you shouldn\u2019t have to live in poverty.\u201d\nBut most employees of federal contractors earn more than the minimum wage, \nso this will apply to only about 10% of those, or 200,000 employees. \nFinally, this wage hike won\u2019t apply until 2015 at the earliest, and even \nthen, only for new contracts, not old ones.\n\n4) How many Americans have gained insurance under Obamacare?\nObama sayeth, \u201cMore than 9 million Americans have signed up for private \nhealth insurance or Medicaid coverage.\u201d\nBut in fact, five million Americans have lost insurance, meaning that this \nnumber is not a net gain. In other words, the vast majority already had \ninsurance before Obamacare. As few as 11% might be new enrollments to \nObamacare. Finally, the payment system for the federal Obamacare website \nisn\u2019t completed; who knows how many of these will experience more \n\u201cglitches.\u201d\n\n5) Obama will cut red tape that\u2019s holding up construction jobs!\nObama sayeth, \u201cwe\u2019ll need Congress to protect more than 3 million jobs by \nfinishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.  But I will act \non my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for \nkey projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as \npossible.\u201d\nBut what\u2019s actually holding back these projects is lack of money, not red \ntape. Joshua Schank of the think tank Eno Center for Transportation \nexplains:\n\n\u201cThe reason most of these projects are delayed is they don\u2019t have enough \nmoney. So it\u2019s great that you are expediting the review process, but the \nreview process isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is we don\u2019t have enough money \nto invest in our infrastructure in the first place.\u201d\nPerhaps if Obama hadn\u2019t squandered what was supposed to go towards \ninfrastructure in his stimulus bill on green energy boondoggles and other \ncrony capitalist schemes, there might have been more money to fund these \nprojects. Nevertheless, not only hasn\u2019t Obama created \u201cshovel-ready jobs,\u201d \nhe has actually lost 720,000 of them in the Construction field.\n\n6) Your medicare premium went up? You\u2019re making that up!\nObama sayeth, \u201cbecause of this (health care) law, no American can ever \nagain be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like \nasthma, back pain or cancer\u2026 And we did all this while adding years to \nMedicare\u2019s finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering \nprescription costs for millions of seniors.\u201d\nThat\u2019s simply not true:\n\nAlthough the basic premium remained the same this year at $104.90, it \nincreased by $5 a month in 2013, up from $99.90 in 2012. Obama\u2019s health \ncare law also raised Medicare premiums for upper-income beneficiaries, and \nboth the president and Republicans have proposed to expand that.\nOn paper, the program\u2019s giant trust fund for inpatient care gained more \nthan a decade of solvency because of cuts to service providers required \nunder the health law. But in practice those savings cannot simultaneously \nbe used to expand coverage for the uninsured and shore up Medicare.\n\n7. Obama\u2019s created 8 million new jobs in the last four years\nThis figure leaves out a lot of lost jobs early in Obama\u2019s presidency and \nglosses over that this recovery has been the weakest since World War II. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only a net gain of 2.4 million \njob have been added on Obama\u2019s watch (this doesn\u2019t account for population \ngrowth, leading to the lowest labor participation rate since 1978).\nYou might think Obama might get into trouble for all these lies, but you\u2019d \nbe wrong \u2013 he\u2019s a Democrat, remember? The media will barely mention these, \nor just ignore them all together. And for Americans who are too busy trying \nto get ahead in this terrible economy, tuning into The State of the Union \naddress allows the president to solidify these misleading talking points in \npeople\u2019s minds.\n\nHe has committed so many impeachable offenses, its amazing no one in \nCongress has accused him:\n\n1. President Obama has appointed numerous people to cabinet level positions \nwithout the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate, as is required by the \nConstitution. These individuals are given extraordinary power and \nindependent funding, and are not under the scrutiny of Congress. The fact \nthat Obama calls them Czars does not make them legal. He has also made \nillegal recess appointments of other members of his cabinet that required \nSenate approval. He simply declared that the U.S. Senate was in recess \ndespite the fact that no such declaration had been made by the Senate. The \nPresident has no Constitutional authority to do this.\n\n2. The push by Pres. Obama to pass healthcare legislation in the Congress \nof the United States that he was fully aware was unconstitutional. He has \ncontinued to use his powers and executive branch of government to implement \nthis legislation despite the fact that a federal judge had declared the \nentire law unconstitutional, and ordered that it not be implemented. In \naddition, Obama has directed members of his administration to violate the \nright to freedom of religion protected by the 1st Amendment to the \nConstitution.\n      Religious institutions such as churches and schools have been ordered \nto provide contraceptives and abortion inducing morning after pills to \nemployees as part of the health care bill requirements. The fact that this \nis a direct violation of their religious teaching is of no concern to Obama.\n\n3. Despite the fact that the United States Senate refused to pass the Cap \nand Trade bill, the President has ordered the Environmental Protection \nAgency to use regulations to implement key portions of the bill, including \nthose regulating so-called greenhouse gases. Obama himself has acknowledged \nthat this will force energy prices in this country to skyrocket. He is \ntaking these actions in direct defiance of the will of the people of the \nUnited States, the will of Congress, and the Constitution. The actions of \nthe EPA include regulations that will force many coal burning power plants \nto close.\n\n4. Through the Department of the Interior (DOI) Obama has placed a \nmoratorium on offshore oil drilling or exploration off both the Atlantic \nand Pacific coasts of the United States and in parts of the Gulf of Mexico. \nHe has also prohibited new drilling exploration on federal land in any \nstates in the United States. These actions by the DOI have continued in \ndirect defiance of several court orders issued by Federal Judge Martin \nFeldman in New Orleans, Louisiana declaring that the department had no \nauthority to issue such a moratorium on drilling in the Gulf. In fact, the \nSecretary of the Department of the Interior (DOI) has been held in contempt \nby the same judge. The administration has claimed to be complying, but has \ntied up the drilling permits in so much red tape that the effect is the \nsame.\n\n5. Instead of allowing American companies to drill for oil domestically, \nObama has betrayed the American people and authorized loans of billions of \ndollars to countries like Brazil and Mexico so that they can drill for oil, \nand then sell that oil to the United States. This will dramatically \nincrease our dependence on foreign nations including Venezuela, Brazil, \nSaudi Arabia, and even Libya that do not serve the interest of America or \nthe American people.\nObama has also refused to approve the keystone pipeline from Canada to the \nUnited States that would not only lessen our dependence on oil from \ncountries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, but create thousands of new jobs \nin the United States. The decision on the pipeline is one that belongs in \nthe hands of the members of Congress, not the President. \n\n6. President Obama has abdicated his responsibility to enforce the laws of \nthe United States against illegal immigration. He has virtually declared \nour southern border an open border by declaring certain areas of federal \nland in states like Arizona as off-limits to federal, state, and local \nauthorities. This is despite the fact that these areas are being used to \nbring in thousands of illegal immigrants, massive amounts of drugs, and \nalso being used by foreign terrorists to infiltrate the United States. He \nhas also ordered the border patrol not to arrest most illegal immigrants \nentering the country, and has stopped deportation proceedings against \nthousands of people in this country illegally. He is in effect instituting \nthe so-called \u201cdream act\u201d bypassing the Congress of the United States which \nhas sole authority over immigration matters.\n\n 7. The President and his Attorney General Eric Holder have clearly \nviolated their oath of office by joining with foreign countries such as \nMexico, Bolivia, and Columbia, in lawsuits against the sovereign states of \nArizona, Georgia, and Alabama to stop them from enforcing the federal \nimmigration laws.\n\n 8. President Obama has ordered the Federal Communications Commission to \nadopt regulations giving the federal government control of the Internet and \nits contents, including providing Obama with a kill switch that gives him \nauthority to shut down the Internet if he sees fit. This is in direct \nviolation of a decision by the United States Supreme Court that the FCC has \nno Constitutional authority to control the Internet.\n      There were two bills pending in Congress to effectively give Obama \nthe kill switch he wants over the Internet. When these two proposals, the \nStop Internet Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act \n(PIPA) were withdrawn amid public outcry Obama announced he will sign an \ninternational treaty that purports to give him the same authority. He has \nsignaled his intention to do this as an \u201cExecutive Act\u201d and not bring the \ntreaty to the Senate for ratification as required by Article 2, Section 2 \nof the Constitution. I believe he intends to take the same action in regard \nto the United Nations Small arms treaty and the UN Law of the Sea treaty \nthat are both unlikely to get Senate approval.\n\n 9. One of the paramount responsibilities of the President of the United \nStates and his executive branch of government is to enforce and defend laws \nadopted by Congress unless they are declared unconstitutional by the United \nStates Supreme Court. Obama has decided that he should ignore this \nConstitutional mandate, and that as President he is more powerful than \neither the Congress of the United States or the Supreme Court. He has \nunilaterally declared that the Defense of Marriage Act passed by the \nCongress is unconstitutional, and further declared that he will not have \nthe Justice Department defend it against lawsuits.\n      His administration has also refused to enforce laws against voter \nintimidation and federal law that requires states to purge their voter \nregistration lists of deceased individuals and those that are registered \nillegally. In addition, the Justice Department is refusing to allow states \nto enforce laws requiring proof of identity by voters at the polls. Obama \nhas essentially said that he is the supreme ruler of the United States, and \nthat the Congress and the Federal Judiciary are irrelevant.\n\n10. It has been widely reported that acting through the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, and Firearms the Obama administration was involved for months in \ngetting legitimate and law-abiding gun store owners along our southern \nborder to supply weapons to straw buyers who the government knew would \ndeliver them to the drug cartels in Mexico. This was billed as a sting \noperation against the cartels when in fact it was designed to produce \nfraudulent data showing that large numbers of weapons were going from the \nUnited States to the Mexican drug dealers.\n      This data was then to be used, and is being used, to try to justify \nnew gun control regulations to limit the rights of American citizens to \nkeep and bear arms. It has nothing to do with arresting members of the drug \noperations. The administration has, in effect, armed our enemies, and one \nborder patrol agent has already been killed by one of these weapons. Now, \nObama continues to impose gun control laws by Executive order so he will \nnot have to deal with Congress. The administration is also refusing to \ncooperate with the committees in the House of Representatives that are \ninvestigating the entire operation. It is even defying Congressional \nsubpoenas.\n\n  11. The President of the United States is not authorized by the \nConstitution to take our nation to war without the consent of the Congress \nof the United States. The only exception to this is the authority granted \nto the President by Congress under the War Powers Act. This law allows the \nPresident to take immediate action without the consent of Congress if there \nis an imminent threat to the security of the United States, or its \ncitizens. Although there was clearly no such imminent threat caused by the \nCivil War in Libya, the President committed members of the United States \nmilitary to combat missions in a foreign country without the consent of \nCongress. He based his authority on a United Nations resolution, and a \nresolution by the Arab League.\n      Now, the President has carried it one step further. During testimony \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 7, 2012, Secretary of \nDefense Leon Panetta told Senators that the President has authority to take \nour country to war without the Congressional approval required by Article \n1, Section 8, of the Constitution. The administration is taking the \nposition that it can ignore Congress as long as it has United Nations \napproval or NATO approval.\n      However, these actions may be the least of the worries facing the \nAmerican people. The White House insisted that language be included in the \nrecently passed National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that gives the \nPresident sole authority to order the military to arrest and indefinite \ndetain American citizens on U.S. soil if the President suspects them of \nterrorist ties. This was amazingly passed overwhelmingly by Congress. It \nappears to be another situation where few members read the bill before \nvoting on it.\n      This was almost immediately followed by another unconstitutional \nexecutive order titled the National Defense Resources Preparation order. It \nis similar to orders signed by past Presidents, but this one includes \nlanguage that appears to give Obama the authority to declare martial law in \npeacetime, and take over the allocation of everything from food and fuel to \ntransportation and health care. This violates the Constitution in a number \nof different ways.\n\n 12. Last but not the least of my dirty dozen of impeachable offenses, is \nthe fact that since taking office the President has used executive orders, \nlaws pushed through Congress in the dark of night, and administrative \nactions by his departments to nationalize and control automobile \nmanufacturers, banks, insurance companies, and portions of the healthcare \nindustry. This is designed to take our country from a free enterprise \neconomy to a socialist economy. There is absolutely no authority in the \nConstitution of the United States that allows the President to do this.\n\nThere are other impeachable offenses as well.\nThe similarities between Hitler and Obama is terrifying.\nhttp://www.nowtheendbegins.com/pages/obama/obama-and-hitler-similarities.htm"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbItU5lPWTO4LQVpK5QKZyQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Chris West", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13wstvqplzovjsja04cjz2bisesvl2adyw0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-12T15:39:07.973Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCbItU5lPWTO4LQVpK5QKZyQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.44665400000000005, "formal_score": 75, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-12T15:39:07.973Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q4Ee9jbTFdo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKY/xSF8p_wkZSI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114275365574162888397", "textDisplay": "+Jackmerius Tacktheritrix \nYou forgot to add that Bush took over a healthy economy and wrecked it.

Precedent tells a better \nstory than the interpretation of rhetoric.  \"Stay in school,\" yes, but make \nsure you learn from history to recognize when a leader uses charisma to \nconceal an agenda, and make sure you learn that the constitution, which has \nundergone the MOST significant changes in all its history in only a few \nshort years, is the only defense Americans have against tyranny.   You \nthink these people in charge are smart? Ideological? They are cogs in a \nmachine that they've been building since Union Oil.\n\n  Read Benjamin Franklin's autobiography and compare his intellect with any \ncongressperson. It's a laughable comparison.  It's like comparing Isaac \nNewton to your high school algebra teacher.\n\n    The founding fathers were comprised of rare geniuses, and the result of \ntheir collaboration was a LEGAL DOCUMENT wherein the inherent principles of \ndemocracy are sacrosanct, with rigorous checks and balances (such as NO \nCENTRAL BANKS, NO STANDING ARMY, RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND PROPERTY...)  many of \nwhich are now gone. And every time they get rid of one, it's amongst a \ncacophony of either xenophobic, nationalistic, or economic rhetoric.  And \nit rarely serves the public interest.\n\n  The Iraq War (which based on the Geneva convention, is an international \nwar crime) was conceived in a froth of \"patriotic\" fear mongering. 13 \ntrillion dollars then gets transferred from the State into the para-state, \nand the Patriot Act (aptly named), amplified executive power and curtailed \njudicial and legislative branches of power - beyond any reasonable \nrequirement for \"national security.\"\n\n Note that even INTERNAL AUDITS of Department of Homeland Security Fusion \nCenters stated \"fusion centers actually cause more domestic terrorism than \nthey prevent.\"  INTERNAL AUDITS of the NSA found \"thousands of infractions \nper year.\"  Documents leaked by snowden reveal NOT A SINGLE TERRORIST \nTHREAT HAS BEEN PREVENTED USING THIS TECHNOLOGY.\n\nThe US may declare any human being an enemy combatant. They have also \ngranted themselves the power to kill any human being under such a \nclassification, regardless of borders or laws.\n\nHey guess what else?

It even has the word \"fair\" in it \nto better emphasize its purpose. I don't care if employers don't like \n\"being told how to run their business\", IF they are not treating employees \nFAIRLY.\n\nIf you find my idea of \"livable\" to be atrocious, hopefully you see my \npoint. Which is, even that can't be supported by minimum wage, for most \npeople. So there's just no reason for the min. wage to be that low anymore.\n\nSears and Wal Mart invest a lot of time in training new employees and have \nhigh turnover. They're still around and probably will be around in the \nfuture, because like other poorly run businesses, they just make the \nMANAGERS do the extra work. So when employees get promoted to managing \npositions, it's actually \"failing upwards\". Lol. \n\nYou don't seem to have a grasp on the reality of how things work when it \ncomes to hourly employment. Salaried employment is a whole other thing, and \ngenerally has much better relations between employee and employer.\n\nThe jobs that pay close to minimum wage, are generally terrible jobs \nalready. It's like adding insult to injury. And nothing will change an \nemployer's attitude about how much they should pay employees for those \npositions. Certainly not the opportunity for better jobs in the area, \nbecause they're counting on hiring people who can't get those jobs. Like \npeople with criminal backgrounds, who are illegal immigrants, bad work \nhistory, etc. They'll always find someone willing to do the work, if only \nfor a short time. Thus, high turnover, shitty pay, terrible working \nconditions persist.\n\nAnd that's what the Fair Minimum Wage Act can rectify. To prevent \nemployers, especially corporations, from exploiting people who can't get a \nbetter job. And if a corporation is going to take the time to spend hours \nand days describing the history of their business to new employees, having \nthem take tests and orientation/safety videos, it just makes sense to pay \nthem a fair wage. Since obviously they're investing a lot into them (it \ndoes cost them money to do this), and value them enough to communicate so \nmuch about their business. They want new employees to value their business \nand vice versa. So don't turn around and offer them a paltry income.

It is already here. That issue died long ago. Sometimes \nI wonder if the Progressive just keeps blathering about it just out of \nhabit.\nHere is my answer to all women who feel jaded for whatever reason. What \nis keeping you from engineering school? Or medical school? Or trade school? \nOr opening your own business? Nothing. And that's what the real feminists \nwho aren't professional victims who have done the above will tell you as \nwell.\n\nThere is inequality. On the producer's end. And frankly we are\ntired of being told that we need to give our earnings from unequal policies \nto the non producer. To the entitlement driven--regardless of whatever they \nfeel the cause of their distress is--color, gender or what not. Things \nshould be completely equal. Let's absolutely fix the corporate bias in \nCongress. And let's also let the terminally lazy have the freedom to place \nthemselves in homelessness for their apathy. Because it is certainly not \nfair and balanced to believe my royalties as a writer should support them. \n\nWe do have an illegal immigration problem. We need to resolve it by \ndeportation. All of them. Every time regardless of their circumstances \nnow. The burden is on them as they broke the law. But the Progressive \ndoesn't believe in the law any more than he believes one should keep what \none earns. They believe the parasite should be sustained at our cost. And \nthat includes foreign invaders, which is what they are. And the source of \nthis is Mexico. You can start by saying that fact out loud.\n\nHealth care should be reformed. All monopolies disbanded with the insurance \ncompanies. Return to fee for service for routine and catastrophic insurance \nfor chronic illness or injury. Both costs would dramatically decrease. Few \nhundred out of pocket for routine as in the clinic in Oklahoma proved by \nreducing costs by 80% when they threw out the insurance companies.And \nreduced costs for catastrophic plans as few would ever use them. But \nthat plan won't be mentioned by either party. Especially the Progressive as \nit doesn't give for free full service to the entitlement class. Everyone \nwould have to participate and Barry certainly doesn't want that. Because \nit's fair.\n\nWhat Barry failed to mention in his speech is we are on the edge of a \nprecipice. We cannot sustain ourselves. ACA will finish us most likely And \nthen like my fiction predicts we will collapse. Because that writing \nwas based on another sage who prophesies what happens when anti reason is\nimplemented and accepted as a nation.\n\nAnd that prophet of our imminent demise is History\n\nCharles Hurst. Author of THE SECOND FALL. An offbeat story of Armageddon. \nAnd creator of THE RUNNINGWOLF EZINE\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13lcbnypznof32wf04ccvxr4szze5voovk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSjuoMY6GJQnYzvS6yNZbGQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jeff Keeler", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-23T10:59:06.965Z", "videoId": "hed1nP9X7pI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCSjuoMY6GJQnYzvS6yNZbGQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.83147199999999999, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-01-23T10:59:06.965Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114015938194785433300", "textDisplay": "Raising the minimum wage to help lower wage workers is a fallacy.\n\nThomas Sowell\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "yvCMjeEG18PwDJm0zWNhEqcvk9Wjjt9hQLhwscslE5U": {"main_comment": "", "replied_comment": []}, "z13lwndyxlmsuzp2223dd5orwwvpvppow04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzHLAQ40oeCrRrGnRYN3y0w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-im7TV9zA8zs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD8/FdJv_ac2XSc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ryan Barnett", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-27T15:34:59.580Z", "videoId": "hed1nP9X7pI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCzHLAQ40oeCrRrGnRYN3y0w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.62458999999999998, "formal_score": 7, "updatedAt": "2015-01-27T15:34:59.580Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106134479378331178425", "textDisplay": "so many uneducated and ill informed americans today.

You've heard that you've been \nlied to, yet those who know the truth all wear colored glasses, so they \nonly see a version of the truth. Truth is relative, yet it may be \nobserved subjectively through testable, falsifiable, quantitative analyses \nof empirical information (what science attempts to do; formulate a manner \nto understand the truth of reality).\n\nIn an ideal world we could presume things about people that would help us \nunderstand them; like rationality or homogeneity, yet the world we look at \nis far more complex. To change ones 'world view' (subjective interpretation \nof reality (its a social process using indirect, non-discrete measurements \nbeing qualified) into 'reality', we would need to abandon all statements \nthat exist dependent upon subjective influences, and replace them with \nobjective statements that exist dependent upon measuring reality. This is \nimpossible because we cannot measure the exact state of reality in the \npast, so the 'ground state' (where an individuals ideas of reality and \nreality itself are equal) is beyond human formulation.\n\nNow, we know truth is relative and people have their particular versions \nthat have been conditioned into them by a social construction founded at a \nmolecular basis. An individuals state is the summation of Newtonian laws of \nphysics. Our external (outside) and internal (inside) environments are \nsubject to the laws of motion (Newtonian physics, when on Earth) and the 4 \nlaws of thermodynamics.  The ground state was determined by these physical \nlaws. The state allows atoms and molecules to interact with constant energy \nand increasing entropy.\n\nWhat is the hidden truth, you may ask? I would argue that those few that \nhave the power aren't choosing what's best for Americans, but rather for \ntheir own selfish concerns. Only a handful of people in the US gov have the \npower to redistribute wealth and infrastructure. What, you think government \nis slow and doesn't work very well? Maybe before the majority of it was \ntaken over by global corporate instigators, but now they're very, very \nefficient at getting what they want. They want you to think congress is a \nbad system, so they can continue to exploit the system, while the system \nexploits all of us. It's only when you think you're powerless that they can \ntake full advantage of the system, and powerless we all feel. They promote \nlies and propaganda that keeps their system in high regard and keeps people \nform forming together with any power to injure that system. We've got to \ncompete against the highly educated class that already has the winning \nhand. They've got us where they want us, and to break their kung-fu grip on \nour necks we're going to need to sacrifice the true American way (the \nideals we hold high; the 'god given right to have our sustentations \ngranted) and replace them with militant methods of combating the \noverbearing weight of the system. A forceful removal of these people may be \nnecessary; other options won't come easily, but you can do your part in \neducating yourself and others, and by taking the steps towards the reality \nyou want to see, we can reduce the strain of this evil upon our society. \nI'm 19 and a community college student; the things I stated are meant to \nsupport my cause, and are not meant to be taken as truth, but only my ideas \nof truth (maybe your ideas are better than mine?).\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12lz3hicyfzt3nkt22izfpbmorazzv1k": {"main_comment":

Two, he can only \ndo as much as he can since the majority of our congress is republican, old, \nand blinded by medieval views that we are struggling to move forward. \nNothing of which he is saying is related to being a communist country, \nactually the totally contrary, he is giving us equal opportunity to be able \nto succeed. We're a capitalist country and I do not find that he is trying \nto change that, just simply keeping up with inflation and even with a \ndeficit, trying to keep kids in school and giving them better education \nwhich can only lead to a better economy. The opportunity to go to college \nfree of charge as long as we are working is almost human right. There are \ncountries who have free college education and are thriving because of it. \nHe also stands by people being able to freely express themselves peacefully \nwherever in the world they may be.

America will not be immune to the fact \nthat questions are being asked increasingly about anything.\n\nThe system you have listed out ' family, self-reliance, hard work, free \nmarkets, respect to g-d' etc are all man made. The industrial revolution we \nstarted in the UK gave rise to the family unit, free market and the so \ncalled hard work you mentioned.\n\nIt was necessary to stratify society in that way to ensure that working \nclass are always available to run the machines. Our education system \nfollows same routine. Which is why in this age of globalisation, internet \nrevolution and technological advancement, there's a real danger that this \nsystems are thrown into chaos and looking for answer.\n\nObama is up front about this because he does not forget his upbringing as I \ndo.\n\nGlobalisation is a problems that must be tackled. Office automation is a \nfact that has to be addressed sooner due to the unemployment it brings. The \nfamily unit of mum and dad (mum staying at home etc) will have to be dealt \nwith too. Kids need answer to questions about many things as they're \nexposed to multiple sources of information. Who had imagined that the \ncorrupt leaders in the middle east will be unsettled by the poor masses.\n\nYou should try and see where Obama is coming from. He's seen much more than \nyou can see and trying to awaken Americans to potential problems. The \nfinancial crisis was just the beginning. Conservatives will just go back to \nthe basis that are no longer sustainable.\n\nthe old wars of invading a country and throwing bombs around is no longer \nfeasible in a world of super info highway and tech. Obama is doing it \nsmartly. Do you give him the credit. No. Israel is relatively peaceful in \nhis time because he must have had some realistic assessment of the crisis \nthere.\n\nIn Bush years, Palestine was a regular killing field and mortars and \nsuicide bombers are a regular thing in Israel. Give him some credit folks.\n\nFundamental changes calls for a strong and bold leadership with the \neloquence to put his case across.

Once \nyou do, you'll come to the same conclusion as everyone else, that Obama is \na fraud, a con man. The only people he serves are corporations, the 1% and \nthe ruling class, not you, not me and certainly not the American people. \n\nYou and I are not enemies. You, me and everybody reading this post need to \ncome together as Americans in defense of this nation and fight these \ncriminals in Washington DC who are destroying us!!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0t-nzlYEB5GqWCGzu6e3Mg", "inappropriate_score": 5.2631578947368425, "authorDisplayName": "G Hill", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12duxvrpkqqjpitd223dnwhpqfxcxyh404", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-30T07:17:20.680Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0t-nzlYEB5GqWCGzu6e3Mg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.19957200000000003, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-30T07:17:20.680Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZM0nPMwGjEo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAeo/WFU5UARrbQE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108548868645002472947", "textDisplay": "I wonder what you have done for America, smart ass.

It will gather proofs for your \ndeeds. All kind of deeds. Oh, I make no accusation. I just wait. I have a \nlot of patience. In the meantime, I will \u201cgreet\u201d you for time to time. \nYou let\u2019s say, took the eyes of some people with your studied smile. But \nthank God I see beyond studied smiles, apparently friendly attitudes or \nelegant packaging of the politicians. And not only of the politicians. \nI noticed you are very reluctant to look into President Putin's eyes. You \navoid looking into his eyes. Why, Mr. President? His eyes are so wonderful \nand honest. I guarantee you that any honest person can look into his eyes. \nAnd with hope. Do you have something to hide? Something President Putin \nmight find out from the look into your eyes, Mr. President? \nAnd changing the subject, I\u2019ve heard that the First Lady of USA, your \nbeloved wife and lady will write a book after you leave the White House. \nTelling to the world the entire life with you at the White House, even \nintimacy. It is true? I hope it is a fake news. I was unpleasantly \nsurprised when I read she wants to tell the secrets and the intimacy. She \nshould respect you more. My mother told me that a true lady or a true gent \nnever reveals his/her intimate moments. It is super OK if she make love \ndeclarations to you telling to the world how much she loves you (I even \nadmire such an attitude and a sincere love, which shows a sincere respect, \ntoo), but she must not reveal the intimacy. I guess I won\u2019t buy that book. \nNot interested. I am interested in how you rule one of the greatest \ncountries in the world. On how you help people. \nAnd another thing, Mr. President. I\u2019ve told you before. It is very painful \nto me to see you want dead innocent babies. Your attitude towards abortion. \nWhy do you want to be another Herod? What I fail to understand most is the \nfollowing: how come your wife does not prevent you in having such an \nattitude? I respect her and in my naivety, I think that a mother of two \nbeautiful girls can\u2019t support abortion. Maybe she does not support you on \nthis issue, but maybe she has no word to tell. If so, that\u2019s also sad. \nChildren must be cherished and protected. Do you believe in God, Mr. \nPresident? Because no matter how powerful someone is, we are all mortals \nand God will judged us. God is a very severe Father, but very correct and \njust. We will all meet at His judgment. Without fancy clothes, smiles, \nguards, limos, gold, diamonds and so on. God will judge us without any \ndiscrimination. We will be naked spirits, then. \nSo, Mr. President. I am stating to lose my respect for you. I think I won\u2019t \ndefend you anymore. Many people curse you. Or maybe if you prove you are a \ncorrect gent I will continue to have a good word for you.  \nP.S. The Olympic Games in Sochi are a marvelous success, Mr. President. The \nbest Games in history. The achievement of President Putin and of the \nRussian authorities. You won\u2019t organize any Games under your mandate, but \ndo not be envious. And President Putin is the greatest leader ever. The \nhistory is fair. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "yvCMjeEG18N_n4OhpYfUvXweFlJLo1n4yu5sD71JgEY": {"main_comment": "", "replied_comment": []}, "z13ewpzwxsfjctxal04ccjnieyfdi1mxp0g": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8r3Fod-jEJS2jrHi8Lf7hw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bryce Morrison", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-31T06:14:53.514Z", "videoId": "hed1nP9X7pI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8r3Fod-jEJS2jrHi8Lf7hw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.98239778, "formal_score": 78, "updatedAt": "2014-01-31T06:14:53.514Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117242578840914052519", "textDisplay": "Politicians = Liars.

The Executive branch is not supposed to \nwield this much power and circumvent the Legislative branch. Remember, its \nyour representatives in the House and Senate from your home state that \nmatter most and this should be reflected in the interaction between the two \nbranches. You have basically stated a preference for a dictatorship.\n2) \" No president has been disrespected more than this man\" - This is a \nlittle short-sighted. How about his predecessor? He was called all kinds of \nstuff , but of course the most common insults were to his intelligence. \nThose insults got pretty vicious and off the top of my head I can think of \ntwo films dedicated to insulting him (W. and A Final Night with George \nBush), not to mention all kinds of shows, cartoons, and political pundits \nthat made fun of him. All presidents have faced (and should have to face) \nparody and criticism, nothing wrong with exercising the 1st amendment. This \nis nothing new, when one party's president is in office, the other party \ndoes its best to criticize and insult the president. It's the wonderful the \ncircle of political life. I just don't like when people pretend their side \nis the only one that ever gets picked on and that they have \"never\" \ninsulted the other side.

When done well a democratic \ngovernment is run by the people as a whole for the people as a whole, when \na socialist government is run as it is meant to be run, it is for the \npeople as a whole and by the people as a whole, while I understand that \nmany fear socialism, You must put into perspective the fears of democracy, \nas well. Democracy does the \"tango\" with corruption day in and day out, \nespecially in our modern world. There are too many ways for those who have \nthe most influence in our country to get away with corruption for their own \npolitical agenda. Both parties are guilty of this. While a purely socialist \ngovernment would never work in this country, leaning towards the ideology \nof what socialism is meant to do for its citizens is not a bad thing for a \ndemocratic government. In fact, it is encouraged. When we live in a world \nand country that is so divided because of social and/or economic class, we \nneed some parts of the socialist ideology, so that we can get back on track \nto how our country was supposed to be run. The definition of democracy is a \nsystem of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of \na state, typically through elected representatives. Which means our elected \nrepresentatives advocate for what we want as the people of this country but \nwhen our \"elected\" leaders fall short of this responsibility, and when we \nas the people are losing our voice for what the government and our elected \nleaders should be doing, a more socialist way of going about things can be \nnecessary for sustaining our rights as American citizens. I wouldn't call \nObama a socialist, but I would call him freedom, and equality orientated, \nas should be all of our congressional and senate leaders. We as a country \nare more focused on Republican or Democrat, when we should be focused on \nthe well-being of our citizens as a whole, we should be directing our \nefforts into what\u2019s best for everybody, not just what\u2019s best for me as an \nindividual. But that seems to be the mentality in our country currently. We \nare so stuck on being right, or being the majority leaders in the HoR, that \nthey seem to forget why they are there to begin with. Our country was not \nbuilt on the hierarchy system of Medieval Europe, and when it feels like we \nhave reverted back to the 12th and 13th century, there are some changes \nthat should be in order. The evolution of government is inevitable with the \ndaunting rise of the technological era, and due to this fact we should be \nimplementing our own ideals for what works today not reverting back to what \nworked yesterday. The world is changing every day, and we have to keep up. \nAnd by restlessly arguing over issues that should be morally simple to \nfigure out, we instead debate and debate, and shut down the government, and \ngo on recess, instead of compromising with those who disagree with us. For \nthem it\u2019s simpler to disagree than to try finding common ground. We seem to \nforget that this country was literally built off of the compromises made \nbetween the two political parties of the 1700's. It is sad to think that \nthe people who started this country were more mature than the ones who \ndefine it today, and that the vision of our democracy and the vision of a \nbipartisan government by the people and for the people are slowly shrinking \ninto the distance. Everyday our citizens become more and more infuriated \nwith those who are running our government, on both sides of the political \nfield. It is not only hard to watch but put simply...ridiculous. What does \nthis all mean it means what should be happening and what is happening are \nnot always one and the same, and that they should be! Your own political \nagenda becomes irrelevant if it does not do what\u2019s best for the people of \nthis country. We are ONE country, not TWO parties. It is time to act like \nit."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEJDBLKEpiGDBIiTcI3VfLQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Chris Gouger", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133ffupimyqvrz2123ltz35lx3ddfzyx04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-02T00:44:22.336Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEJDBLKEpiGDBIiTcI3VfLQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.438218, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-02T00:44:22.336Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116987592607752873930", "textDisplay": "Because Reagan didn't increase the size and scope of the federal government \ncontradicting his libertarian rhetoric."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGwNdhDKd5Jz6_ANgx2OSvQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Arab Katib", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133ffupimyqvrz2123ltz35lx3ddfzyx04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-30T23:35:32.604Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGwNdhDKd5Jz6_ANgx2OSvQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.79770199999999991, "formal_score": 68, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-30T23:35:32.604Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-33yGekRxWhg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABQ/118KXMv7lRQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101027300817883758839", "textDisplay": "+Muslim Liar\nDoes freedom has an official name?

Socialism is a philosophy \nin which society should value and prop up all members equally and that \nnobody should have an unfair advantage.  It sounds good on paper, yet when \nput in practice it creates a number of problems in society.  The main \nproblem with Socialism is that your gathering power into the hands of a few \nin government, and they could easily use socialism as a tool to gain power \nover a broad base.  Socialism has a few other problems as well, such as \nincreased national debt, as the private sector is put under high strain the \neconomy drops and growth stops.  Chronic unemployment in the private sector \nand large employment in the government sector are good signs that socialism \nis growing and taking root.  Lastly you can see that socialism takes roots \nthrough class warfare and dividing the body politic such as in pre WW2 \nGermany, Soviet Union, Italy, even the United States.

That most of these chaps are not elected by you guys beats my \nimagination of the freedom you have.  They are now\n\nI'm not hear to paint Obama white but I detect like many others (from \noutside your country) that you hated this man even before he took office. \nWe read and hear what even elected republican officials have to say about \nhim. They demanded to see his birth certificate (a president of a free \nworld). On one occasion, I even saw one of the elected officials (a woman) \njabbing fingers at him at the airport. Then he's called a Muslim, a \nterrorist, socialist etc. These happened few years into his time in office. \nIt's therefore no surprising that the slightest set back or mistake will be \nso exaggerated to prove points full of prejudice.\n\nThe Libya (Benghazi) incident was another case that has been exhumed so \nmany times by the republicans that you think Obama ordered the attack. The \nhealth care was previously meant to be the NHS equivalent in America, but \nto discredit it, they renamed it 'Obama care' (give a dog a bad name and \nhang it). Ever since then there's been more campaign to make it unworkable. \nAgain no wonder its failing you so far.\n\nThe real enemies of your country are those working hard to ensure that \nevery policy/program fails. The NHS is never a bad idea. In fact, \nRepublicans are yet to come up with a viable alternative. Your  health \nsystem may be one of the best, but it comes at a price  that is beyond the \nreach of the majority of pple.\n\nIf the cheaper alternative is not working, I'm led to believe (from what \nI've pointed out) that some entities are working hard to derail it for you \nand score a political point.\n\nThis is a man trying his best to limit the killing of your soldiers by \nbringing them home, killing your number one enemy (Osama) without \ncommitting the entire USA troop. Just imagine for one moment, this was done \nby Bush.\n\nHe'll be saluted and hailed as the Montgomery of modern era.\n\nWhen you harp on about one man, please recognise he's not there on his own. \nThere are very old men in the congress (old to be his dad or grand dad) and \nbent on maintaining a status quo.\nIf you don't deal with the real evil now, but prefer (conveniently) to \nattack one man because it's befitting his background to single him out; \nyou'll have to do it someday and perhaps in a very hard way.\n\nI don't make the most noise, 'cause I have nothing to gain from the success \nor otherwise of your country but it smacks of hypocrisy to attack this guy \nwith such vengeance when you just had the worst president in living memory \n- Bush. A non-English speaking president that was unaware that twin towers \nwould be raised down and could not even bother to do his home works before \nattacking an innocent country because his dad had issues with their regime. \nMiddle east is not safer today."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCousuc-GJPrOQDrQJgn7XNg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "jostledmusic", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z120ensootfmgj0n423ztf5pvsnovrmye04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-05T03:50:11.627Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCousuc-GJPrOQDrQJgn7XNg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.14103200000000005, "formal_score": 90, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-05T03:50:11.627Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110801037452855604543", "textDisplay": "+Chris West\nMay I throw some thoughts into the mix...?\nAs citizens of a once free nation, it is prudent that we hold our elected \nofficials accountable.  Disagreeing with them is our right, expecting more \nof them, and keeping their desire to impose their own interests on us as \nlimited as possible, is our job...or else we would simply be peasants \ndealing with whatever our \"Dictator\" decides to do with us.  \nThe U.S. HAD the best health-care in the world.  The insurance industry was \nthe original problem.  Now, we might have to bail out insurance companies \ndue to a line in the \"affordable care act\" that our politicians didn't \nbother to read before passing it into law.  \nThe Obama administration cut funding to medical research companies (like \nMedtronic), as well as programs that help families with mentally challenged \nyouth. And now with all the problems and realities of Obama-Care coming to \nlight, it is estimated that there will be just as many people who won't be \nable to afford health care as there were before it was passed.  Odds are \nthere will be many more people than that who will not be able to get health \ncare due to all the taxes, regulations on businesses, and penalty-fees that \ncome with the new healthcare law.  Get off your high-horse.  People who are \nignorant and hateful make the most noise and draw the most attention. \n There are plenty of sensible people who aren't racist, sexist, or, \nnativist that are simply tired of being screwed-over by self-righteous \ncontrol freaks that feel that THEIR values are somehow morally-superior to \nours.

Anyone who even questions them gets ostracized, \ncalled racist, a stupid \u201cHick,\u201d and irrelevant in the modern political \nworld.  People with conservative values don\u2019t automatically agree with what \nevery conservative politician did ever.  We are of these values due to \npractical experience, knowledge of world history and how rare freedom is \nfor the average person, and because we observe human behavior and know that \npeople (in general) are dangerous herding animals that can be manipulated \ninto doing anything, in spite of their awareness of the detriment of their \nown actions on themselves.

You had your chance to \nbe a leader, but you simply aligned yourself with big money corps and banks \nat the expense of our school children.\n \nIntelligent Americans can easily see that it is the disarmament of our \nschools that dreams in these psycho shooters. And Obama we know that you \nsee this also - But you put your plan to disarm American citizens above our \nchildren's lives.\nYou demonstrated zero responsibility by giving my hard-earned tax dollars \nto unnamed European banks.\n\nBy the way, there is no such event within a cyber attack that results in \nstolen files.\nThere is only foolishly under-budgeted poorly planned computer network \ninfrastructures within our government, Hollywood movie industry, and retail \nstores like Target.\n\nAmericans need to wake up and realize that most governments are aligned \nwith corporations with a goal to increase socialization of everything until \nthe average citizen is a slave to politicians and corporations. These \npoliticians should be working for us - but it is obvious they do not\n\nSimply listen to the speeches (as written) from most politicians. They are \ntelling the people what is going on and what they are going to do about it \n- while ignoring the root causes of the problems\n\nVery few politicians are doing the job that we put then in office to do.\nInstead, they are trying to align with big banks and corporate moneys.\nSenators makes it sound as if reducing the $18T budget is too complex - all \nwhile lying and signing up for more debt in order that their corporate \nalignments will give the politicians a kick-back.\n\n\n\n \n \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQXA10P9jFmMf-6mPnGuBug", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jemarcus Pullins", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125jdjoozaggfmev231x3jxcrbfi3vnm", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-22T02:00:20.288Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQXA10P9jFmMf-6mPnGuBug"}, "sentiment_score": -0.73664200000000002, "formal_score": 80, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-01-22T02:00:20.288Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9oamULt3O8s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAew/5PrIWxuuVfU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115999179832340011559", "textDisplay": "You mentioned the Gun Free School\nZone, an act that was not initiated in the Obama administration.

Since you \nmention that I was a retard, I\u2019m going to leave you a comment worth \nreading, so the next you call someone a retard you better think twice!\nOk then! \nLet me show you how retarded you made yourself look!\nFirst of all if you want to raise your earning wages it not by bitching to \nthe federal government to raise the minimum wage for you! But by going to \ncollege to educated, finding a better job or creating a business! By \nraising the minimum wage not only your causing unemployment but causing \nforced inflation. Ask yourself! When \u201cnot\u201d you not see a big corporation \nreplaces its workers with machines so the big owners could keep a bigger \nprofit? Also don\u2019t forget about the foreign workers the big corps pay 40 \ncents an hour to make silly iPad! Now tell me how is raising the minimum \nwage is going to help while the lazy is always being lazy? Capitalism is \nfor the working class, not for lazy! I believe the best social program is a \njob \u2013 Ronald Reagan\nSecondly let tell you that I\u2019m a gun owner myself and I\u2019m against \u201cGun \nControl\u201d! Yes I\u2019ve said \u201cbuy a gun and learn how to use it\u201d I know I wasn\u2019t \nvery specific in detail and you misunderstood. By saying you\u2019re an anti-gun \nsupporter and think that everyone with a gun is bad make sure you realize \nthis: you are spitting in the grave of the great men and women who fought \nand gave the ultimate sacrifice so you can enjoy the freedoms that people \naround the world would die for! Isn\u2019t it \u201ccommon sense\u201d how many enemies we \nhave around the world in this country? Ask yourself! Look at the countries \naround the world that would love to invade and conquer the United States of \nAmerica and I know what you will probably say! \u201cWe have a military, so we \ndon\u2019t need guns\u201d well our enemies don\u2019t fear the U.S. Army, The Marines or \neven our most notorious Navy SEALs! They fear the AMERICAN PEOPLE and it\u2019s \none of the main reasons why we never had an invasion, no one would ever \ndear to invade! You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would \nbe a rifle behind every blade of grass - Isoroku Yamamoto\nLastly I get my information on books, blogs, internet and documentaries but \nnot from the mainstream! Personally I do not watch TV and I don\u2019t care\u2026 \nfuck FOX new, NBC, MSNS, CNN and etc. and it TV rots you\u2019re brain! Instead \nof spending 2 or 3 hours watching TV you could read books, learn something \nnew, create a new hobby, apply to new jobs, do side work, or volunteer"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCutmGPtUAJoQ4y3B3eI6ZZA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Matthew Lamothe", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13pdlfilyqwuno0c22bzdvitnzrg3ppv04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T07:41:29.560Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCutmGPtUAJoQ4y3B3eI6ZZA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.23496399999999995, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T07:41:29.560Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117953038946084166860", "textDisplay": "He's not in control of the economy...

He would be a man of integrity that is \nsincere and genuinely cares about his country. He would understand that a \nstrong economy is essential to provide all citizens with an abundance of \nopportunities to be able to utilize their skills and achieve success. He \nwould stop the flood of illegals on day one in office by putting troops on \nour borders. He would not ever take pack money from any big businesses and \nwould understand that it is wrong to take large amounts of capital and be \npersuaded to do things for these big businesses as a requirement for taking \nthe money. He would understand that our country is not doing well, in fact \ndoing poorly. He would balance the budget to stop anymore dept from adding \non the the almost 18 trillion dollars that Obama has brought on the the \nAmerican people. He would understand some basic logic such as \"Life is not \nfair\". He would understand that capitalism is the best system we have and \nbenefits all Americans. He would have real world experience in business \nunlike our current commander in chief. He would have spend time in the \nmilitary unlike our current commander in chief. He would continue ensuring \nthat the United States is the superpower and invest in our military \nunderstanding that our world is not a safe place at this time. He would \nbring all our troops home and we would stop getting involved in other \ncountries business. He would start utilizing all the resources we have in \nthe United States and drill for oil here in order to get the price of a \ngallon of gas down to one dollar like it should be. We would not be victims \nof the high prices of a barrel of oil. He would understand that the more \nmoney people have, the more money they will spend and that taxes are too \nhigh and it is a burden on Millions of Americans. He would realize that he \nwas hired by the Americans that voted for him and that he would be \nresponsible to carry out his agenda as promised to the American people. He \nwould feel very strongly about our constitution and that we need to adhere \nto what the founding fathers put forth as the greatest system in the world. \nHe would repeal Obama care and then implement a system where citizens that \nare legal would be able to get health care. A man that believes all of the \nthings I have stated is \"Donald Trump\". If he runs for president in 2016, \nhe will have my vote. Currently there is no candidate that I am supporting \nto be our next president.
