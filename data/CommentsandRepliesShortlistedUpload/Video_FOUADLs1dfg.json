About 75% of what the professor \nsays is just untrue and not precise enough. He clearly wasn't prepared or \ndoesn't know Switzerland at all. Worst, his academic abilities might be \nmanipulated by his political views. The \"minimum revenue\" he speaks about \nhasn't been voted yet and will surely be refused. The minimum wage was \nrefused in 2014 by 76.3% of the population. The 1/12 initiative (created by \nthe Socialists) was refused by 66% of the population in 2013. The Gini \ncoefficient (calculating the inequality within a society) of Switzerland is \none of the lowest in the world, much lower than many european countries led \nby left-wing parties (like France). The median wage in Switzerland \n(calculated in PPP) is one of the highest in the World and the purchasing \npower of the middle class hasn't been decreasing, quite the opposite. Plus, \nif the banking/finance sector is important to our economy, it is still only \nabout 5% of our GDP. So please, forget about this world clich\u00e9 of \nSwitzerland being nothing but a big safe. \n\nWe have our problems, no doubt about it. But please, if you want to do a \nrealistic analysis of a country, at least try to rely on facts and not \nideology and/or anecdotes. \nI have the greatest respect for the USA, a country I've lived in and \nappreciate a lot. I also have a lot of respect for many american \nuniversities, including the University of Massachusetts. This is why I'm a \nlittle bit disappointed by the \"analysis\" of this professor who, I hope, \nknows better about his country than about mine. \n\nPlus David, where did you see a 30 USD burger? I knew that restaurants in \nZurich are expensive but not 10 times more expensive than in the rest of \nthe country... :)\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClepRj_qtwPFVAtikxE7KRA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "William Tyndale", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nvbarolv2jepkkzf3yj54uonwww5c", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-26T12:17:36.893Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UClepRj_qtwPFVAtikxE7KRA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.88862599999999992, "formal_score": 9, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-26T12:17:36.893Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Wifl1q8uIns/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACs/hFUyuhO32A0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108520469407307661793", "textDisplay": "+Tomas Mesar  I well remember Adolph standing on the Zermat giving a \nrallying speech to the Swiss, whilst yoddling."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7epLqDWY2nVxMbOnQzN8g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tomas Mesar", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nvbarolv2jepkkzf3yj54uonwww5c", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-28T21:15:31.682Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCu7epLqDWY2nVxMbOnQzN8g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.340082, "formal_score": 37, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-28T21:15:31.682Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110241761701005513120", "textDisplay": "+Peter Plus\nYour point?

Many factors contribute to this sort of \nfatalism, and it is hard to motivate complacent people to change the way \nthey live.  In the US, we aren't doing so well, and its hard to argue that \npeople are unmotivated to change simply because they are complacent.  A \ndeeper understanding of what is going on, would require models with enough \nexplanatory power that they will be capable of describing the similar lack \nof action in both the US and Switzerland, as well as many other countries \nthat would included developing and undeveloped nations. \n\nWith that in mind, there is one \"model\"/\"perspective\" that I only rarely \nsee that is capable of providing a different perspective on how problematic \ninequality can be.  Economic systems are dynamic, and the change our \nsociety demands is not simply *\"growth\"*, but really the *accelerated \n\"growth of growth.\"*  This sort of growing growth is what investors bet \ntheir money on, and so businesses that *ONLY* profit will be considered \nfailures if there profit margin lacks continual and accelerate growth. \n\nThe point is that our society creates wealth at a constantly increasing \nrate, and when inequality gets worse, this means that average people are \nworking more to produce what is essentially *\"excess wealth\"* that they \nnever see.  It is the constant production and growth of this *excess wealth* \nthat has an immediate and obvious impact on every person with a job: we are \nworking more than we need to in order to run our society. \n\nIn the US, real wages have been fairly stagnant for the past 40 years, even \nthough productivity continued to grow during that entire time.  You can see \nit most strikingly in data like this,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Productivity_and_Real_Median_Family_Income_Growth_1947-2009.png \n.\n\nThe plot shows the change in \"real median family income\" over time, from \n1947 to 2011.  This \"change\" includes the \"growing growth\" that I told you \nabout, but can also include periods of \"no growth\" and of decline.  On the \nvertical-axis, \"100%\" refers to their being no change in income from some \narbitrarily chosen point in the late 60's or early 70's. The result is that \nour income is less than 25% larger than this arbitrary reference point from \n40 years ago. \n\nWhat makes this arbitrary point interesting is that it represents the point \nwhen real wages become disconnected from the real growth in our \nproductivity.  Since this time, productivity has *tripled*, while we only \nexperienced 1/10th of that growth in our income. \n\nThe \"model\"/\"perspective\" that I spoke of earlier, that is capable of \nillustrating the real and immediate every day impact of inequality is that \nthe degree to which we overwork may be enough that everyone could work \n\"part-time\" (less than 25 hours), while maintaining their current standard \nof living.  Everyone keeps the wealth and property they currently own, but \nthat excess wealth goes to us who can choose to either work less than they \ncurrently do while maintaining their current standard of living, or they \ncan still work less than they currently do, and increase their standard of \nliving by working the new \"overtime\" which is the current \"full-time.\" \n\nIn the US, this chart *implies* that our standard 40 hour work week (true \navg 42 hours in 2013) could, on average be decreased to 1/3rd that amount \n(about 13 hours) every week, while getting the same paycheck every week. \nIn Switzerland, the average hours worked per week is 35 hours (average \n$50,000/yr), and is likely a little bit less than it has been in the past, \nif it follows the trend of most other progressive countries.  The amount is \nstill small, but is much more than the change for Americans which has been \neffectively stagnant for about 30 years. \n\nThe System sucks and we are wasting our lives away.  We can do better than \nthis."}}]}, "z135dd5zjtjnetbwm04citujbwe4dteih4g": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCprteNQBugD3HYtdS5UshlA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-152wCVngSwU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADSs/BM3nxRAR3Go/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 3.225806451612903, "authorDisplayName": "Nathan Alder", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-06T17:33:20.777Z", "videoId": "FOUADLs1dfg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCprteNQBugD3HYtdS5UshlA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99727839000000007, "formal_score": 30, "updatedAt": "2015-09-06T17:33:20.777Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115918213749145751452", "textDisplay": "omg my fucking god! it's not 30 CHF FOR A CHEESE BURGER! it's 15\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z120ynq43wfqtnf3423gyj0i4t30ynd11": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxoBONIH2g_i4NKZIiyoPJw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "tmberli", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-01T07:36:45.424Z", "videoId": "FOUADLs1dfg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxoBONIH2g_i4NKZIiyoPJw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.24198600000000003, "formal_score": 14, "updatedAt": "2015-10-01T07:36:45.424Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114387049828027893918", "textDisplay": "Interesting talk, but falling short on some crucial facts.

don't give 80% of our anti-biotica plus tons of \nhormones production to cattle our beef is actually abt for human \nconsumption, also our laws force McDos to pay decent slalaries to their \nemployees

I am \nnot Swiss but I visited that country many, many times as y family lives \nthere and I absolutely love it every time I go. I am yet to come across a \n$30 cheeseburger so I am not quite sure where you paid that amount. As for \nfood quality, I can assure you that no country in the world comes remotely \nclose to Switzerland with regards to quality control. That is the only \ncountry in the world where I would consider consuming a fast food product \nbecause I know how stringent tests you have to pass before you are even \nallowed to sell the product in Switzerland, burgers including. Swiss tap \nwater is something that the rest of the world can only dream about, I am \nsubjected to much laughter from my family when they see me drink it by the \ngallon every time I go to visit :-). Basic needs in Switzerland are \naffordable to everybody, the more luxurious the product is the more it is \ngoing to cost you which makes every sense in the world. Housing is quite \nexpensive but then again come to Paris or London and let me know how much \nthat is going to cost you over here. Swiss public transport in its current \nstate is roughly where the rest of the Europe will be in say 20-30 years \ntime and it is easily affordable. You can set your wrist watch using their \nbus service, trust me on this one. I can assure you that I am not employed \nby Swiss tourist board advertising the country :-) but I was a bit taken \naback by your talk about Switzerland being THAT expensive. As someone who \nvisits the country once or twice every year I don't find it extraordinarily \nexpensive at all. Switzerland is the closest to democracy as I have ever \nseen in my life, they vote on everything so you really do get the feeling \nthat you as a citizen matter. It's only a small country so it is \nnotoriously difficult to get residence permit but who can blame them, take \na look at the rest of the Europe and try to convince me that mass \nemigration works. A word of warning though.

He sounds like a primary-school pupil \nsnobbishly convinced that his freshly acquired small knowledge is already \nenough to explain the world to everyone. It starts with the claim of a huge \nincome gap which he would have actually to recant when the moderator \nteaches him that Swiss wages even for the lowest-paid jobs are on a level \nunheard of anywhere else. It is also not true that the wealthiest Swiss are \nbankers. There is not a single banker among the 50 wealthiest Swiss \nresidents! Bank ownership is very diversified. Switzerland is in fact \nexpensive because of the earnings of its export industry selling a lot of \nhigh-margin products like luxury watches or sophisticated pharmaceuticals \namong other things. The high wages of workers in these industries allow \nalso for the internal economy to pay higher wages/ask higher prices. The \ncost of the workers wages make up in fact 70-80% of the revenues in the \nmajority of Swiss businesses! So they ARE the main factor determining the \nprice! If a business cannot pay their workers a certain wage, the service \nsimply cannot exist, as Switzerland has de facto full employment. If that \nservice appears to be vital for the economy and society, they simply \nautomatically have to raise the wages and with them the prices in order to \nattract enough manpower. Another factor is the densely populated space in a \nvery mountainous terrain which makes real estate rare and expensive, \nsimilar to Japan. Mr. Wolff seems to still think in the patterns of Karl \nMarx and the 19th century industrial age when he tries to give equal \nsignificance to material, energy etc. Welcome to the service economy and \nthe 21st century! Other plain factual mistakes by Mr. Wolff: Switzerland is \nNOT in the EU. The initiative on unconditional minimum income has NOT been \nvoted on yet. There has been recently a vote on a (much less extreme) \nofficial minimum wage for workers, and it has achieved merely 23% of \nYes-votes. So the vote on unconditional minimum income will be most \nprobably below 20% Yes, not the \"nearly 50%\" Mr. Wolff seemed to have \ndreamed about.    \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment":

conversation; Switzerland by any means is a prosperous \ncountry and that is because it is a very well run country; the politicians \ngenerally know what to do and the swiss are responsive to that. Secondly, \nSwitzerland has a huge current-account surplus with the rest of the world, \nbecause of banking but also because it goes out of its way to attract \nforeign companies through fiscal incentives; this in turn creates the \nlowest unemployment rate in Europe (c.4%), which creates demand for more \nlabour (hence more immigration) and hence the very high wages (a \nsupermarket employee can earn 4000SF a month which is a lot of money).\nWages are high but services are also expensive: health services are of a \nhigh quality but expensive, people discount a lot for social security and \nretirement age;  the average swiss home is 50 sq m large, women go on \naverage 6x a year to the hairdresser and basic services like going to a \nrestaurant are not cheap. Part of this problem is the exchange rate of the \nswiss franc to major currencies, which does not make it cheap. Something \nmost foreigners don\u00b4t know also is that the consumer in Switzerland gets a \nvery bad deal as most companies try to fleece the swiss consumer because \nthey can afford it: a BMW may be the same price in Germany, France or Italy \nbut it can be 30% more expensive in Switzerland. The government here fails \nmiserably the consumer because the central government has transfered a lot \nof power to the cantons and the cantons cannot get together in an efficient \nway to solve this problem. Hence the huge numbers of swiss citizens who \ncross the borders to shop in France, Italy and Germany where everything is \ncheaper.\nAll in all Switzerland offers some of the highest standards of living in \nthe world as well as quality of life (eg Zurich is often considered the \nbest city to live in the world). It is not all bad but Switzerland is a \nvery interesting study-case for anyone interested in economics.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13purmalquhczvd122wetwhwvfospaun": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOFdHBOkFIHCODL6gGzd7aA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mcP8q2Efjyc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI0/QMMuNwCLkas/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Niklaus Manuel D", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-29T07:02:28.046Z", "videoId": "FOUADLs1dfg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOFdHBOkFIHCODL6gGzd7aA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.28038199999999996, "formal_score": 35, "updatedAt": "2015-05-29T07:02:28.046Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111134300645841734996", "textDisplay": "Hamburgers expensive in Swiss Mc Dos? really? because we are missing the \nfamous Pink Slime method here in Switzerland  which makes hamburgers so \ncheap and toxic in USA, its actually against the Swiss law to add dangerous \nchemicals to food in Switzerland such as done in USA and Canada and \nalso the animals are raised and slaughtered in a humane manner which makes \nthings more expensive, thats why we Swiss  don't have food poiisening as \nrampant as in USA and since we don't give 80% of our anti-biotica \nproduction plus tons of hormones to cattle our beef is actually abt for \nhuman consumption, also our laws force McDos to pay decent salaries to \ntheir employees same in Germany thats why WALMART left our civilized \ncountries to go back where they can exploit humans, a land of the free \nslaves called USA, also since we produce potatoes GMO free and they don't \nhave to be aired for months to get rid of toxins you can actually look at \nSwiss Hamburger being real Food without any Yoga Mat additives, \nhormones,penicillines and toxins which can kill you.....enjoy your healthy \nburger in Switzerland where we have laws passed by the people not some \nMonsanto puppets who give a damm about the people.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}}}
