Only cities \nlike New Orleans, Chicago and Orlando compare to the deaths caused by \nBombings in Baghdad Iraq per year. There are also less major cities in the \nDesert regions because no water! So that's a false equivalency. in 2012 the \nmost people that died were 60 due to mass shootings. About 80 were injured. \nThat's Sandy Hook and the Theater shooting combined. So the most shootings \nwere not mass shootings but individual shootings, by crooks that aren't in \nthe KKK. More Blacks are killed by Cripps and Bloods per year than the \nentire history of the KKK. And the PKK makes the KKK look like a bunch of \ncry babies. You don't even want to know what Boko Haram does, or what ISIS, \nor Al Shabbab, or Hamas, or PLO does on a daily basis. In the Muslim world \nit's war all the time. Not Hijrab mind you, that means a military campaign. \nYou know the kind the West uses to fight their wars? Well Jihad simply \nmeans Struggle. And that struggle is for the sustainablility of their \nreligion. Muslim means one who submits to Allah and his prophet Muhammad. \nISlam means Submission. It does not mean Peace. In Arabic Submission is \nsynonymous with Peace. IT's a duty to sustain the religion. Muslims do not \ncall themselves by a name or a sect like the Denominational Baptists or \nMethodists. It's not a name they give themselves. It's a name given by \ntheir enemy. No Muslim calls themselves anything but Muslim unless for sake \nof people who don't understand. The Titles are all insults identifying the \nnon believers and apostates from the true muslims. The Salafists, the Sufi, \nthe Waahabi, all believe they are the true Muslims. Shia tries to prove \nthemselves true Muslims. To prove it they commit Jihad (not Hijrab) meaning \nit could be anything from a middle finger, to a Nuclear Bomb! Study the \nArabic language. Persians are not Arabs. Niether are Africans. Trump has \nalready said there would be exceptions. He's talking about Radicalized \nMuslims- and is using an anchor to Clinton can come out and take a stronger \nposition. If she takes the stronger position then he will probably let her \nwin. IF she won't move from her current position set by Obama, who likes to \nsip lead filled water in flint, she will destroy her own chances. This is \nGame Theory. He tells you exactly why he doubles down on the subject. Call \nit Radical Islam- because there is something behind everyone of these \norganizations. That is the Quran and Muhammad's teachings. Let me just ask \nyou this... how many german girls have been mass raped this past year? \nGermany hasn't tried to cover it up? Go back to the Golden Age. Read about \nhow the Pope, and Moors, and Ottoman Empire sold slaves. The Jews were \ninvolved too. But not in the Transatlantic Slave trade, the Islamic Slave \nTrade. Look it up!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOdbhWxV9MYSRbsqISJFcRA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ray haan", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13zvhlxgvftvvgg504cdn3rgr2ktncg1hk", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T18:47:59.690Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOdbhWxV9MYSRbsqISJFcRA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.383504, "formal_score": 97, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T18:47:59.690Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tVotfjnAxEk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACrs/PY-91eaemg8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102936447429731863418", "textDisplay": "+Edwidge Whatsosons hahahahahaha....so u think Trump is aware of these facts"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGSdlvypoHRTGBHyZ-4glbA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kuypers125", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13zvhlxgvftvvgg504cdn3rgr2ktncg1hk", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T18:45:29.125Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGSdlvypoHRTGBHyZ-4glbA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9290879, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T18:45:29.125Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106947829461852866098", "textDisplay": "That was a very long winded way of saying \"But the other can be bad too\"\nNext time try using punctuation, paragraphs, and a coherent point\nBecause \"the great wall of text\" is just asking to be ignored"}}]}, "z13ju1vxpufhchnyi04cfxlzzoens5nyegc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAOLbNdfZ1kAaDvMRPHv1sg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ra_wwjw4B3w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAII/gvFfYHW5r74/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Adam A", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T21:55:24.424Z", "videoId": "eXdpgG8szq4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAOLbNdfZ1kAaDvMRPHv1sg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.5926819999999999, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T21:55:24.424Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108084598860934702860", "textDisplay": "London just elected a Muslim mayor, well he be banned under Trump's \nAmerica?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK6q_tfHiZPbIjbrdt0D97g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Timefliesbye", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ju1vxpufhchnyi04cfxlzzoens5nyegc", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-07T01:53:55.517Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCK6q_tfHiZPbIjbrdt0D97g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.084868, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-07T01:53:55.517Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XMrtDihAUmw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/zj9ZxHP1d1A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102870356576825053691", "textDisplay": "+Adam A He'll be banned from immigrating to the US.

I live with Christian family members who don't go to \nchurch and break several verses in the Bible but still say they believe in \nit (that's religion for you). It's also likely if this were done to other \nreligious groups, that the people would cry out \"religious \npersecution/discrimination\" and how this \"violates the 1st amendment of the \nConstitution.\" But like I said, I'm open to harsher rules and procedures \nwhen it comes to Muslim immigration vs. other minorities. *\"Being a muslim \nis a subscription to certain ideas in varying degrees\"* What about Baha'i \nMuslims, Ahmadi Muslims, or Alawite Muslims which have different beliefs in \nthe Qur'an; and have also been persecuted by majority Muslim communities? *\"No \ninterpretation is something that we need to push for. interpretation in the \nwestern world is due to the blows that the enlightenment and reason dealt \nto religious ideas.\"* Completely agree; I want to see more liberal \ninterpretations of all religious books so these followers can better \nassimilate into Western society. Even if Islam is harder to interpret more \npeacefully, doesn't mean it's impossible. There are feminist movements in \nthe Muslim world for example that are trying to get equal rights \nestablished and Islamic reformers interpreting the Qur'an in a more liberal \nmanner. I'm not denying that Islam by its raw literal meaning is more \nviolent than other religions, but reinterpretation isn't impossible with it.\n\n3. *\" Because most people don't want to read the book in it's entirety, \nthey would rather have it broke down into smaller pieces by someone they \nperceive as \"qualified\"\"* Well then that explains why mosque are important \nthan in the Muslim world; and when you have someone considered \"holy\" \nspouting the literal meaning of the Qur'an to a bunch of children and \nmoderates, that would possibly lead to another generation of terrorist."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCthhUs5twUTvfP6kVglPUvA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Redak Dnom", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cif241oazz5kea22rtvvgfk33hnosr", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-08T09:15:16.417Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCthhUs5twUTvfP6kVglPUvA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.502812, "formal_score": 11, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-08T09:15:16.417Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DSlBDC21-YA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/-g-6vItALtg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117641547742264848805", "textDisplay": "Ok I see your perspective.\n2.

If \nthere're Muslims that, despite believing in violence and sympathize with \nISIS (and no amount of argument and debate will change their opinions), \nwon't break the law, at least they're not breaking the law in the end. \nWestern societies are, after all, suppose to be about freedom of speech, \nthought, and expression.

So if \nthe heart of the religions were most important, then Christianity should \nhave been more peaceful; even back when it was in power. As with Islam, if \nthe heart really was crucial, why is it that Islamic terrorism is only a \nrecent world issue? Compared to the 19th and 20th centuries, The Muslim \nworld has much larger rates of Extremism than before. What you can say led \nto the de-radicalization of Christianity could have started with the \nEnlightenment and continued from there with the French Revolution where \nliberal ideas got the people of Europe to abandon monarchies and divine \nrule. Christianity is still crazy; it's just that it's been kicked out of \npolitics (at least almost) for good; thus removing a lot of possible power \nit could have had on the people. The internet could also play a big part in \nthe destruction of Christianity and radicalism entirely; especially since \nit's currently working in reducing the amount of religious followers per \nyear.\n\n2. You said it right there in your sentence: \"millions of radical \nIslamists.\" Yeah, those guys which would most likely not be allowed into \nthe US if they really have those kinds of sympathies to ISIS. Like I've \nbrought up, a strong vetting system into their backgrounds is an effective \nway of reducing the amount that get in. There are also plenty of Muslims \nwho - because of growing up in the US and going through *secular* education \n- have assimilated just fine here despite having deeply religious parents. \nUsually, the initial immigrants tend to be the most conservative, but the \nsecond and third generation settle down and don't hold as extremists views. \nMaybe Western Civilization needs to do it because: our economies are the \nstrongest, we've played a big role in the Muslim World for decades now, and \nour culture is arguably the best in terms of what it has to offer. So \ngetting that culture to the Muslim World - even if 80% of Muslims at that \ntime despise it - there'll at least be a minority that like it and would \nwant to live in that kind of environment. Assuming a portion of them have \nkids, that percentage of approval would go up from there.\n\n3. Why would anyone believe anything a religious Holy Book written \nthousands of years ago would have to say? One of the reasons for the lack \nof skepticism is the lack of an opposing side. In Saudi Arabia for example, \nthey outlawed liberal interpretations of the Qu'ran; essentially forcing \ndown their interpretation to the masses. They are also the ones funding the \nmosques in Europe. This is where the whole \"battle of ideas\" theme comes \nfrom. If you were to challenge radical Islam in the Middle East in its \ncurrent position, then you'd most likely get executed. In the Western world \nhowever, with the internet, top-quality education, and a government that \nwon't kill you for your views, we can finally challenge these views in a \nmore safer environment. I understand it'll be tricky to get these ideas \ninto the Middle East without them getting shot down to Islamic governments, \nbut it'll still make a difference if we helped the reformers as much as \npossible with spreading their message and even our culture. Here's an \ninteresting article I found about what happens when these Islamic \ngovernments lose power and Western Culture is brought in. \nhttp://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-04-21/features/0304210029_1_postcards-of-indian-stars-titanic-or-titanic-hair-large-cucumbers-and-potatoes\n\nAfter the Taliban fell, Titanic fever began to rose again.

Argentina for \nexample, the general population is 74% accepting to only 12% against, \nArgentine Muslims are still 82% for capital punishment of gays with just 4% \nagainst punishment.\n\nThe more accepting non-western Muslim population, is those in Bangladesh, \nwhere just 67% think gays should be punished, with a whopping 10% saying \nthey are against gays being punished through the legal system.\n\nBritain is a touch better: only 66% of British born Muslims are for \npunishing homosexuality.\n\nAmerica is the best... but 70% of our Muslims are people *who have \nconverted to Islam while in prison.* It's somewhat difficult to be against \ngay rights, when you convert to your religion while being boned in the \nbutt. :p\n\nStill, it's 48% of American Muslims who think homosexuality should be \npunished with legal action.\n\nIn extremely sharp contrast, 54% of all American Christians think that \nhomosexuality should be completely accepted by society.\n\nOnly 23% are against gay marriage rights.\n\n3% think homosexuality should be punished with a fine, while less than 1% \n(to the point it rounds down to 0) think it should be punished with jail \ntime.\n\nThat's quite a divide, even among America's most backward peoples. \nUnsurprisingly among atheists it's 94% accepting, and virtually no one \nagainst equal marriage rights or for punishments.\n\nMy point is, I have enough 'fun' trying to deal with the 40% ish American \nChristians who don't want to accept homosexuality: I'd rather not have to \ndeal with the 90% + Muslims who want me punished by the government.\n\nAmerican Muslims are ok. If we want to set up an immigration test to filter \nout the homophobic Muslims from the non-homophobic Muslims, then we can let \nthem in, but unless we are ready to at least try and distinguish between \nthem, I don't want any Middle Eastern or South Pacific Muslims coming to \nAmerica: the ratio between those that wouldn't try to pull our nations \nculture backward is just way too high.\n\nIf someone has the means, they can move to Europe, or maybe even spend some \ntime living in Canada, then move to America after they partially \nassimilate. We don't need to be accepting people from other continents: if \nwe want to help, we have plenty of economic migrants from our own continent \nwho aren't so culturally backwards."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCix-d4JfcfcIqVl8Nbwp5dA", "inappropriate_score": 0.48465266558966075, "authorDisplayName": "mm1996", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ixjyzalivznxeu23uu1242suivzdc3", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-08T03:52:32.412Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCix-d4JfcfcIqVl8Nbwp5dA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.7684820000000001, "formal_score": 64, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-08T03:52:44.095Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111342998234497773000", "textDisplay": "+AS Deckard I'm bisexual too.

Even \noverlooking that, a great many Muslims in the west support Sharia Law, and \nhave zero intention of adapting to the country that takes them in. If you \naren't willing to adapt, you don't come in, period. Islamic culture has \nalways been draconian by nature and does not respect our separation of \nchurch and state. These Muslims sound to me like the true bigots. Yes, \nthere are plenty of Muslims who are good people and respective of their \nhost country, but too many of them will always try to impose their beliefs \non us. So, why should we take a big chance and let in tons of Muslims \nbecause \"they're not all extremists,\" when we can not take a chance at all \nand block their immigration until we figure things out? What if somebody \ngave you a gumball machine, and said that 10% of the gumballs inside are \npoisoned, but the other 90% are okay? Would you then reach inside and eat a \nhandful of gumballs, leaving it to luck that you don't get poisoned? I'm \nguessing probably not.\n\nAlso, what if the situation were reversed, and millions of white Christian \npeople started pouring into Muslim/Arab countries. These white Christians \ncome in, they have little respect for Islam, and have no intention of \nadapting to your culture. Their birthrate is also higher than yours, and as \ntheir numbers grow, they start demanding that you adapt to them. You know \nthat these people will eventually destroy your culture and things will \nnever be the same. Would you be happy with this situation and keep saying \nthat we should let more white Christians in for the sake of \nmulticulturalism, or, would you support a candidate who says that we should \nput a ban on all white Christian immigration? If your answer is the latter, \nthen you are a hypocrite, and are by your very definition a bigot and a \nracist. My guess is that most of the Muslim/Arab countries would be doing \nwhat they could to stop this, and that's exactly what Donald Trump is \ntrying to do over here."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPud2N0fiWJePp4VIosxtEg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "hamza abid", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ejd0ojvqgjvife22xthqarqiben1qg04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-09T01:46:44.958Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPud2N0fiWJePp4VIosxtEg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99749812, "formal_score": 37, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-09T01:46:44.958Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104705115503822972215", "textDisplay": "+Chad Warden you're worthless and uninteresting :)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Kki_FH44L9A5OIoSMrP6g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Chad Warden", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ejd0ojvqgjvife22xthqarqiben1qg04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-08T18:56:24.428Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8Kki_FH44L9A5OIoSMrP6g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.12897800000000004, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-08T18:56:24.428Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111874995779378057536", "textDisplay": "Salam brother, I'm Muslim too and I fully support Trump and his TEMPORARY \nban on Muslim immigration."}}]}, "z131dfihvu3lfnkt4233jj2ixr3nubw0y": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 3, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOG7iFeqyDf_XfHTqyOPPEg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-F4A54DOJXS0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHY/hxqlwc24aGY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 2.0408163265306123, "authorDisplayName": "Lauren Caddo", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T06:45:12.737Z", "videoId": "eXdpgG8szq4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOG7iFeqyDf_XfHTqyOPPEg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8869696, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T06:45:12.737Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108385410720006915240", "textDisplay": "He wants them to stay near their home.

Well, it \nseems you only looked at the first article and stopped there. Here is what \nTrevor Philips says about this topic in another artcile: \"...the gaps \nbetween Muslim and non-Muslim youngsters are nearly as large as those \nbetween THEIR ELDERS\u201d. This means that the younger generation is more \nradicalized than their parents and grandparents, not only that the \nnewcomers are more radical (which by itself would be quite a problem \nleading to the general radicalization of the group as a whole).\n\nQuote: [About daesh] \"In saying that Isis are the 'true believers' of Islam \nyou've allowed them to win\". NO! I'm just reflecting the reality rather \nthan sugarcoat it like you do. Mohammed genocided people and took sex \nslaves (see the genocide of the Banu Qurayza tribe), just like daesh does \nto the numerous communities (like the ahmadis). Mohammed ordered the \nassasination of his critics (see the murder of poet Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf). \njust like daesh does (Charlie Hebdo). As for the claim that daesh \"added \npillars to the faith\", I haven't found credible sources for that.\n\nQuote: \"Why WOULDN'T you take into account that America waged an illegal \nwar in the middle east that destabilized the entire region?\" Because I \ncan't change the reality. The radicalization is real and growing and \nwhatever the main reasons are, I can't reverse and choose a different \nreality where the middle eastern conflicts didn't happen.\n\nQuote: \"...if only we just agreed with the right wing, gave them more power \nand let them do their absurd policies, they'd go away\". Give them more \npower!!?? I'm arguing for the implementation of reasonable policies by the \ncurrent mainstrem government, not to give more power to the far-right!!! \nFar-right getting power is what happens when you don't adopt needed \npolicies and instead vilify anyone who dares to say the opposite.\n\nQuote: \"You keep ignoring how the new testament contradicts the old, I'll \ntake that you have no counter as validation\". Chrisitanity was ALWAYS based \nmainly on the techings of Jesus (hence the name Christianity), not the old \ntestament! Initially, those teachings were delivered through apostolic \npreachings, which were essentially early incomplete versions of the new \ntestament. You seem to think that the OLD Testament refers to \npre-reformation, when in fact it refers to pre-Jesus. The teachings of \nJesus supersedes the old testament, which is explicitly addressed only to \nthe jewish tribes, not to the entirety of the world's population.\n\nQuote: \" 'Why did they care'... Really?\" Now you're putting in words in my \nmouth again!!! And to make matters worse you put them in quotes. REALLY? \nINDEED!! The problem isn't that they care, the problem is that they kill \ninnocents for that and that it's not political as you claimed before, but \nreligious!!! Otherwise, other non-muslim people who care from around the \nworld would have conducted terrorist attacks also.\n\nQuote: \"You really gotta let go of no-go zones\". A no-go zone is an area \nwhere the authorities have lost control. Look at \"No-go area\" on wikipedia \nand you'll find plenty of examples and their soruces: \"Belgium\u2019s home \naffairs minister said that the government did not 'have control of the \nsituation in Molenbeek'\" - that's what a no-go zone is. Sweden has the \ninfamous Malmo, plus some 55 other such zones. You've got to let go of your \nblinders!\n\nQuote: \"Jesus saying all sorts of problematic things in the bible\". I am \nwell aware of the problems with Jesus, but they're not on par with the ones \noriginating from mohammed. Mohammed actually instructed his followers to \nsubjugate/kill non-belivers, while Jesus did not. Mohammed actually \nmurdered people himself, took slaves, raped and ordered assasinations of \nhis critics. Jesus did none of the those! Enough with these false \nequivalences between christianity and islam; they don't hold under scrutiny.\n\nQuote: \"Pretty shameful if you ask me, being scared of creeping sharia and \nusing that fear to justify letting millions die and live in poverty\" + \"Yes \nI would call most xenophobes throughout history cowards, including you\". \nOh, great: Japan has received in 2015 only 27 refugees out of 7586 \napplications, while in 2014 only 11 out of 5000; China receives none, just \nas most of the other east asian nations. They are all coward too, right? \nHow conveinent that only you and people like you are brave*!! (brave* - \ndangerously naive and stupid).\n\nQuote: \" 'Where are the left wingers who criticize Islam?' \". Again, \nputting words in my mouth with quotes. I asked about mainstream (leftist) \nmedia articles and politicians who present islam and mohammed as they are. \nYou respond with Bill Maher and Sam Harris. I'm well aware of both of them \n(and the hatred they receive from the mainstream leftism media) but that's \nnot what I was asking. And \"They hate us because they hate us\" is not what \nI'm looking for, but a mainstream refutation of islam in its core \nscriptural values (which are the heart of the evil). And Joe Scarborough is \nthe token right-winger on msnbc and by no means reflects the views of that \nleftist channel.\n\nQuote: [About daesh view's of islam] \"...a position that billions of \nmuslims would ferociously disagree with\". \"you, as an outsider, don't get \nto determine which of a faith's followers are doing it in the 'correct' \nway\". Actually, there is only one correct way, and that is the one \npracticed by mohammed, which can be ascertained form the quran, the six \nauthentic hadits and mohammed's biography as written by the early muslims. \nIt doesn't matter what I believe about islam, or you, or those 1.4 \nbillions. Only what its founder believed as written in those texts. That is \nthe true islam, and the closer one gets to follow mohammed's behaviour, the \ncloser one is to the correct interpretation of islam. And we know how \nmohammed behaved...\n\nQuote: \"You basing your positions on muslims in countries with theocratic \ngovernments\". I'm basing my position on observations of behaviour of muslim \ncommunities in the west, which derive from polls, news, individual \nattitudes, reactions from authorities and credible officials who are not \nafraid of telling the truth, on top of the attitudes of muslims from \nmuslim-majority countries.\n\nQuote: \"You oughtta be proud that our culture is known for being \nreligiously tolerant and welcoming\". It's not gonna be that way for long, \nregardless of who wins the culture war (or the actual wars that will \nfollow).\n\nQuote: \"I base my lack of worry on more than emotion, the facts back me up. \nThe trends you describe are either open to interpretation or patently \nfalse\". You have your blinders on, but they'll fall eventually, just hope \nthat they do before the damage done is ireversible.\n\nQuote: \"Islamization requires the adoption of Islamic principles within our \ngov't, something that you cannot point to in any form\". UK has civil sharia \ncourts implemented already. They have halal food in schools even for \nnon-muslims to make sure that if there are muslim pupils, they won't face \nthe \"horror\" of eating food forbidden in islam. Those are signs of \nislamization in the UK, which is just farther down the rabbit hole than the \nUS.\n\nQuote: \"Muslims are not becoming more radicalized in western countries than \nbefore\". They actually are, see the first paragraph of this long reply.\n\nQuote: \"The far-right, while being more vocal, is actually receding\". Yes, \nthat's why in Europe far-right parties are gaining seats even though for \nalmost half a century they were only a fringe, isn't it?.\n\nQuote: \"MSM is no friend to Islam - they constantly conflate radical Islam \nwith muslim practitioners as a whole, to the point that guys like you and \npeople all over the country think Isis speaks for Islam.\" No, it's not \nbecuase of MSM, but despite of it. Daesh speaks for islam because its \npractices come from islam and the example of mohammed, not because MSM says \nso (which it doesn't, with the exception of some right leaning outlets).\n\nQuote: \"Worship God because if I'm right and you're wrong, I go to heaven \nand you go to hell, so it's better to be safe than sorry\". It is not a \nPascal's Wager what I'm proposing. My views are based on reality and the \nassement of likely consequences based on trends, while Pascal's Wager is \nabout fantasies about god and hell.\n\nQuote: \"You should actually be ashamed of yourself for trying to twist the \nfacts and claim otherwise\". Not twisting anything, nor do I have a reason \nto be ashamed. But when reality will dispel your unicorn fantasy, YOU will \nbe ashamed."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqhJPQIra1HS-DqXWQRp4Cg", "inappropriate_score": 0.08084074373484236, "authorDisplayName": "Cody Davies", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135wlrw4uiqgrwtx22lgnk4ute1wxotv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-09T00:28:23.583Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqhJPQIra1HS-DqXWQRp4Cg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.7067619999999999, "formal_score": 20, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-09T00:34:02.361Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103126706726618863097", "textDisplay": "-I read the article, it's talking about muslim immigrants who hold \nilliberal views, not changing attitudes within existing muslim populations, \nproviding no proof that groups of muslim citizens get more radical over \ntime.

Very \ndifferent.\n\n-In saying that Isis are the 'true believers' of Islam you've allowed them \nto win; they seek to be known as the 'true' muslims so that westerners will \ntreat muslims in their country with distrust and fear so that muslims will \nbe radicalized - you treat someone like a criminal long enough, they will \nact like a criminal. Talk to any Imam in America and they will inform you \nabout main-stream Islam's long tradition of non-violence. Isis added \npillars to the faith for crying out loud, they are not true practitioners \nand you concede the fight against them when you say they are.\n\n-Why WOULDN'T you take into account that America waged an illegal war in \nthe middle east that destabilized the entire region? Seems pretty relevant \nto me, as it shapes perception of our country and our role in the world; \ndid you know that a significant number of Iraqi's actually think that the \nU.S in cahoots with Isis?

Really? Shit man, I care about how our country blew \nup the middle east, you don't? Imagine an atheist colony in Asia is under \nconstant bombing by the U.S, you wouldn't be upset? Not saying you'd go \nradical and start killing random people, but you can see why social \nintroverts with mental problems would, correct? People can be tribal, just \nask Dylan Roof; he shot up a black church because he perceived his own \n'race' to be under attack, how is this different from the Boston bombers \nblowing up the marathon because they believed the group they identified \nwith - muslims - is under attack?\n\n-You really gotta let go of no-go zones; most people would have stopped \ntalking with you by now figuring you can't tell the difference between fact \nand fiction. If you've got compelling info please share, I'm dying to see \nthese mythical public places where whites and christians are kept out by \nmilitant muslims.\n\n-If someone says they committed a crime in the name of christianity there's \nenough violent passages in the Bible (old and new) to justify it. Just \ntaking a quick look at this page that shows Jesus saying all sorts of \nproblematic things in the bible that, if interpreted as written and \nfollowed to the letter, would end in horrific violence - \nhttp://skepticsannotatedbible.com/cruelty/nt_list.html\nWith passages like that I don't see how anyone could argue that the bible \nis solely pacifistic, and this isn't even taking the old testament (which \nJesus says is just as valid as the new,) into account\n\n-So you ARE advocating for not helping refugees fleeing war? Noted. Pretty \nshameful if you ask me, being scared of creeping sharia and using that fear \nto justify letting millions die and live in poverty. Way to show them whose \nculture is better.\n\n-Yes I would call most xenophobes throughout history cowards, including \nyou. I do have the courage of my convictions, I strongly believe that a \nsecular gov't entices people, all people of every denomination of \nchristian, jew, muslim (and there are many denominations, you lumping all \nmuslims into one group is massively ignorant) etc. And there have been \nnotable examples of multi-cultural areas that prospered, in fact \nConstantinople in Byzantium is an excellent example of what can be achieved \nwhen people put aside their religious differences, and it was that way for \ncenturies until European crusaders came and sacked the city for profit, \nlook it up, fourth crusade, it's an excellent example of people using \nreligion for profiteering and political gain.\n\n-You're also forgetting that the whole point of America was to try things a \ndifferent way and be more inclusive, so you bringing up that every barbaric \ncivilization of times past was afraid of 'the other' means absolutely \nnothing - people use to think leeches would heal the sick, do they still?\n\n-You might not think you're an Islamophobe, but even you can't deny that \nmany exist - people who don't look at the larger picture and just avoid \nmuslims because they look/sound/act a little different. And I'm talking \nabout people of all straights; even on the left there are people who are \notherwise very socially conscious who fear muslims due to their depictions \nin MSM - news, video games, movies, tv... when was the last time you saw a \nmovie where the white guys were the bad guys and the brown guys/muslims \nwere the good guys? I literally can't think of one. So what's a muslim \nsupposed to do? Invite themselves over to their white coworker's house and \nshow them they are not what is shown on tv? If we're going to ever bring \nmuslims into the fold, we need to give them the benefit of the doubt rather \nthan instant suspicion.\n\n-\"Where are the left wingers who criticize Islam?\" Gee I don't know... ever \nheard of Bill Maher or Sam Harris? Two of the most popular left-wingers on \nthe planet and also two of the most vocal critics of Islam? That's not even \nbringing up msnbc whose anchors perpetuate muslim stereotypes on a daily \nbasis. I'll say it again, Joe Scarborough -\"They hate us because they hate \nus\"\n\n-On deash again, If you say that they are the 'true believers' (which they \nbelieve but the other 99.99 % of muslims do not) then you are IMPLICITLY \nsaying that it is the natural conclusion for anyone who ascribes to Islam. \nI'm not seeking to misrepresent you, there's no reason to do that when it's \neasy enough to address your actual positions, and here again you are \nconceding the fight and allowing Isis to claim that it is the world's most \nforemost authority on all things Islam, a position that billions of muslims \nwould ferociously disagree with; you, as an outsider, don't get to \ndetermine which of a faith's followers are doing it in the 'correct' way. I \ncould say that some fundamental christians are the 'true followers' because \nthey follow the word of god to the letter, does that make it true? Even \nwhen every other christian disagrees? A religion is more much malleable and \nopen to interpretation than you give credit for.\n\nTo your conclusions,\n- You basing your positions on muslims in countries with theocratic \ngovernments is not taking into account that muslims who migrate are trying \nto ESCAPE that oppression, not bring it to the rest of the world. Your \naverage muslim has no interest in forcing everyone else to abide by their \nreligion, they're just seeking places where they can practice themselves \nand not be worried about the local government cracking down on them for \nbeing Sufis, Baha\u2019is or Ahmadiyyas for example. Think of muslim immigration \nas the pilgrims leaving England to practice christianity according to their \nbeliefs and you'll get a fuller picture of what's going on. You oughtta be \nproud that our culture is known for being religiously tolerant and \nwelcoming (in theory anyway, once they get here they have to deal with \nbigoted assholes).\n- I base my lack of worry on more than emotion, the facts back me up. The \ntrends you describe are either open to interpretation or patently false:\nIslamization requires the adoption of Islamic principles within our gov't, \nsomething that you cannot point to in any form.\nMuslims are not becoming more radicalized in western countries than before, \nanecdotal evidence about psychopaths is not indicative of any major trends.\nThe far-right, while being more vocal, is actually receding. Just look at \nthe statistics concerning how liberal and progressive our youth is and you \ncan see what the future holds.\nMSM is no friend to Islam - they constantly conflate radical Islam with \nmuslim practitioners as a whole, to the point that guys like you and people \nall over the country think Isis speaks for Islam. The reason there is a \npush to re-label Isis (Islamic State of Syria and Iraq,) as daesh is both \nbecause daesh is seen as derogatory by those within it, but more \nimportantly it's to distance Isis from mainstream Islam. And with good \nreason, Isis DOES NOT speak for 99.99% of the worlds BILLIONS of muslims; \nthey added pillars to the faith, effectively changing the holy doctrine. \nBut you wouldn't know that from watching MSM, may it be Fox, CNN or MSNBC.\n-You're last conclusion is particularly ridiculous: We should listen to you \nbecause if you're right, it'd be disastrous if we didn't? You do know \nthat's one of the oldest arguments for religion right - \"Worship God \nbecause if I'm right and you're wrong, I go to heaven and you go to hell, \nso it's better to be safe than sorry\"? It's really odd to be talking with \nan atheist who thinks like a religious zealot and lets their arguments be \nshaped by fear, panic and conspiracy theories rather than observable facts \nand credible sources.\n\nIf we go down the path you advocate, we are trading an implausible, \nimagined disaster for the DEFINITE deaths of millions of people. I said it \nbefore and I'll say it again - it's callous, cowardly, and un-American.

We can debate an \neternity about how much each factor contributes to this happening, but what \nI'm saying here is that it is happening and there doesn't seem to be any \nrealistic way to stop this.\n\nQuote: \"You say you're worried about western right wing groups, so why are \nyou advocating for their policies?\" I am advocating policies which take \ninto account the actual consequences, and not the ones based on emotional \nwishful thinking and misguided humanitarian sensibilities. And applying \nreasonable policies would take the oxygen away from the far-right groups \nand they would go back to becoming irrelevant. Otherwise, you can keep \ngoing on the current path which will fuel the far-right and will get them \nto power eventually, and then you can be certain that the misguided \nhumanitarianism will be replaced by the exact opposite.\n\nQuote: \"You're latching on to the protestant reformation\". I didn't even \nmentioned protestantism. I mentioned the reformation of the religious \ninstitutions which apply to all the christian denominations.\n\nQuote: \"we saw political motivations wrapped up in religious rhetoric\". \nSure, but let me ask you this: why do a couple of muslim CHECHENS decide to \nkill innocent people to protest about interventions in IRAQ and \nAFGHANISTAN? They were not Iraqi or Afghani. Why don't Atheists from \nSweden, or Buddhists from Korea, or Orthodox Christians from Greece decide \nto kill people in protest for those interventions? Why is it that we see \npeople form unrelated muslim countries decide to take upon themselves the \ntask to avenge such interventions, and not people from non-muslim \ncountries. If political reasons would be the main cause (as you seem to \nclaim) than you would expect to see those people form Sweden, Korea, \nGreece, etc to conduct such attacks as well.\n\nQuote: \"If you have good non-biased proof that no-go zones exist\". Nowdays, \nnon-biased sources comes to mean mainstream leftist ones, the ones wrapped \nup in PC nonsense. I don't have those yet, but as this problem will \nincrease, even they will begin to cover it.\n\nQuote: \"like muslim mass murders; I can throw white christians who've \ncommitted similar crimes out there to argue the opposite, and neither point \nwould hold water\" NO, because you can't link chrisitianity as being the \nsource of that violence, since the teachings and character of Jesus don't \nsupport that, while the ones of mohammed do.\n\nQuote: \"We shouldn't allow immigration by migrants and refugees fleeing \nwarzones on the less than .01 percent chance that they'll commit violence?\" \nIndividual violence is only one small problem!!! It's the creeping \nislamization of the society and all the evils that come with that! It's the \nfact that politicians will pander to retrograde islamic practices to gain \nmuslim votes! It's the fact that eventually we'll get a very muscular, \nrabid far-right in power, whether they will be the white far-right or the \nislamic far-right! It's the fact that this will lead to a dystopian \nnightmarish society, regardless of which far-right will be in charge!\n\nQuote: \"That strikes me as gross, cowardly, and un-American\". Firstly, I'm \nnot American, so I don't care about being \"un-American\". \"Gross\" - that's \njust your own gag reflex and I don't care about it. \"Cowardly\" - now, \nthat's rich: Do you understand that the vast majority of the world today \nand all the world in past times are/were very conservative and thus \nsuspicious about foreigners, especially when they came in high numbers and \ndidn't assimilated in their societies? Do you know that this \"DIVERSITY IS \nSTRENGTH\" nonsense was almost never practiced in the past and still isn't \npracticed in the vast majority of the world today with the exception of the \nwest and very few other isolated cases? Then, according to your logic, the \nvast majority of the world today and the entirety of the world in the past \nis/was COWARD! That makes you and others like you the very few courageous \npeople in history! Or maybe this attitude of yours is just suicidal \nnonsense paraded as virtue!\n\nQuote: \"Did you consider the possibility that they're not being invited?\" \nHave you considered that they live in self-segregated manner (in the \nEurope, at least)? Regardless of why, the reality is that they're not in \ncontact with people of other faiths and, whithout that, the deconversion of \nyour christian firend cannot be replicated with the vast majority of \nmuslims.\n\nQuote: [About MSM]\"What planet are you living on?\" Where are the (leftist) \nmainstream media articles where they describe mohammed like the mass \nmurderer that he was? Where are the (leftist) mainstream media articles \nwhere islam is described as the opposite of \"the religion of peace\"? Where \nare the respectable mainstream politicians who dare to speak the truth \nabout the nature of islam and the actual character of mohammed?\n\nQuote: [About daesh] \"you brought it up first as being the obvious natural \nconclusion to anyone who worships Islam\". Now you're putting words in my \nmouth. I claimed that daesh are the truest followers of islam, that they \nfollow islam and the example of mohammed very \"religiously\". I did not \nclaimed that every muslim (or even the majority) will eventually come to \npractice islam as daesh. I claimed that even the ones who are way below \ndaesh in terms of their radicalism, are still very dangerous for any \ncivilized society.

And honestly any statistic needs to take into account the constant \nwars in the middle east and how that makes it a hell of a lot easier to \nrecruit idealistic youngsters. If Europe was under constant warfare we'd \nsee many more radicals throughout the west than we already do as well. I'd \nsay that right wing support in the west is growing specifically because of \nthe negative framing against refugees and migrants; some people in the west \nPERCIEVE their values to be under attack because of the media's BIAS \nagainst muslims, when really they're abandoning their own cultural values \nof humanitarianism by writing off millions of people due to fear. You say \nyou're worried about western right wing groups, so why are you advocating \nfor their policies? You are right that the western nativist right wing is \ngrowing, but it's due to the PERCEPTION of a threat, rather than an actual \nthreat. You ignore that we've had muslims in our country for hundreds of \nyears and it was only after 9/11 and the fear mongering afterwards that \npeople started to view muslims this way. Again this dissonance with reality \ncould be avoided if we as a society worked to spread rationalism and a good \nepistemology.\n\n- You're latching on to the protestant reformation, ignoring everything I \nsaid about the first reformation (the new testament) and how the new \ntestament CONTRADICTS the old. Like I said, I don't know exactly what a \nreformation in Islam would like like today, but writing any kind of \nreformation off as an impossibility is ignoring the successful adoption of \nJesus and the new testament of the bible. If the old testament with all \nit's fire and brimstone can be amended, why not the quran?\n\n- I'll take back what I said about San Bernardino being the only terror \nattack, forgot about Boston and a lot of those events you mentioned are \nclassified as other things like work-place shootings and hate crimes so \nthey don't get brought up as much (I'd blame this on our classifications, \nfor some reason if you're brown its terrorism, if you're white is mass \nmurder, go figure). However in each of those events where we could \nascertain the motives and psychological states of the actors, we saw \npolitical motivations wrapped up in religious rhetoric and often found \nhistories of mental illness. For instance the Boston bombers said they were \nmotivated by U.S actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and both them and Nidal \nHasan had all the psychological hallmarks of other mass murders like Cho \nSeung-Hui, James Holmes, Dylan Klebold, Eric Harris, the list goes on. I \ncould say Robert Dear is a representative if christianity because he claims \nto be a soldier for god and the unborn, but that'd be ignoring how bat-shit \ncrazy he is. The point is that ALL of these guys are exceptions rather than \nrule for both muslims and christians.\n\n-My point is that demographic make ups don't always (or even all that \noften) determine who is in power, not saying we should take muslim voting \nrights away. It's a simple refutation to the (rather simple) point that we \nshould be scared because there will be less whites in the future. There's a \nbillion other factors in play besides simple demographic shifts, and I'd \nsay the only difference we will see is a rise in white radicals, people who \ndon't like change and are scared of being in the minority because they've \nseen how badly America treats minorities while whites are the majority. I'm \noptimistic about the future, I don't see America ever embracing a \ntheocratic form of governance no matter how much our demographics change, \nlike I said before, that's our country's biggest draw - that we DON'T tell \nyou how you can or can't worship - and migrants and refugees of all \nstraights recognize that, just ask Baha\u2019is and Ahmadiyyas muslims who flee \ncountries with radical gov'ts. The only people who want to control what \nreligion people subscribe to in America are evangelical christians, and \nthey are quickly losing power to secularists of all types.\n\n- If you have good non-biased proof that no-go zones exist, I'm all ears. \nOtherwise I'd stop bringing it up to me or anyone else because it really \nhurts your argument; it feeds my suspicion that you get news from sources \nthat just confirm your bias.\n\nI'll conclude by saying that I think the fear of muslims that you've \ndisplayed is all too common in the west; you're alarmed over something that \nyou don't have adequate proof of; the things you've brought up are either \nanecdotal (like muslim mass murders; I can throw white christians who've \ncommitted similar crimes out there to argue the opposite, and neither point \nwould hold water - exceptions to the rule) or anti-factual (no-go zones - \ndisproven by multiple fact-checks and only put forward by the most \nright-wing of outlets). You are worried about a slippery slope that we've \nseen no hard statistical or historical evidence for that would point to \noppression by muslims in the near or distant future. At the end of the day, \nyou are advocating for policies that have deeply negative humanitarian \nconsequences. We shouldn't allow immigration by migrants and refugees \nfleeing warzones on the less than .01 percent chance that they'll commit \nviolence?

The Internet is readily available \nin the western countires and it hasn't done anything to reduce radicalism, \nquite the opposite, as the muslim fundamentalists use it as a propaganda \nmedium. The muslim communities in the west have only gotten more radical as \ntheir numbers increased. So far it seems that access to information does \nalmost nothing to reduce adherence to islam and quite a lot to increase \nradicalization via islamist propaganda.\n\nQuote: [about islam reformation] \"even if it takes hundreds of years it is \nstill worth doing\". As I said before: WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME AT OUR \nDISPOSAL!!! The muslim communities in the west are growing relentlessly and \nas they do, they become more fundamentalist in their views. At the same \ntime, the reaction to this, which is far-right support, is growing also. Do \nthe math: two evil forces are relentlessly growing: how much time until \nthey'll clash in a violent way?\n\nAnd you still keep comparing reformation in islam with the one in \nchristianity, which is wrong. I repeat what I said in the previous reply: \nThe reformation of christianity involved mostly the diminishing of power \nfor the christian institutions (church, papacy, kings, ...) and not the \nrejection of the core teachings of Jesus, while the reformation of islam \nwould need the rejection of core techings of mohammed and the rejection of \nmohammed as the evil person that he was. Two very different approaches, and \nthe one for islam is nearly impossible to pull off. So, whatever example \nchristianity or other religions might offer about reformation, THEY DON\"T \nAPPLY TO ISLAM.\n\nAs for the example with your christian friend leaving his faith, a few \ndifferences:\n- Unlike christianity, islam punishes apostasy with death, which makes even \nentertaining notions that would make them leave the faith very unappealing \nfor muslims;\n- Unlike christians, muslims rarely interact with people of other faiths \n(or no faith). A recent poll conducted by the Channel 4 in UK concluded \nthat 80% of muslims from UK never enter the house of a non-muslim, which \ngets to show how segregated they are (in a country where there are plenty \nof non-muslims);\n- Unlike christianity, islam is protected from criticism in the main-stream \nmedia and politics by accusing anyone who dares to speak up of being an \nislamophob, bigot, racist, nazi, fascist, on top of the constant lies that \n\"\"islam is the religion of peace\", \"mohammed was a peaceful man\", \"jihadis \nare not true muslims\", \"terrorism has nothing to do with islam\", etc...\n\nQuote: \"the people who hate daesh the most in the world are muslims\". I \ndon't care, because one can hate daesh and yet still be in favour of \npunishments for apostasy, homosexuality, adultery, and against freedom of \nspeech and secularization. And, in the long term, those views are even \nworse than terrorism.\n\nQuote: \"in America where we've only had one attack in 15 years\". ARE YOU \nKIDDING !!!??? San Bernadino, \nBoston Marthon, Seattle Jewish Federation, Arkansas Recruitng Office, Fort \nHood, Chatanooga. Plus numerous failed ones like (off the top of my head): \nUnderwear Bomber, Printer Cartridge Bombs, Time Square Bomb, Shootings at \nDraw Mohammed Contest, etc.... And the numeorus sting operations conducted \nby FBI and Homeland Security to catch wanna-be jihadis.\n\nQuote: \"And I wouldn't worry about demographic changes so much\", \n\"demographic make-ups are no indicator of who has the power\", \"blacks \noutnumbered whites in many areas yet still had no political power\". WHAT?? \nAre you supporting the western societies to remove voting rigths from \nmuslims? If not, then how do you compare desirable future societies with \nthe ones in which blacks were slaves? Because as long as the muslim \npopulation grows, the politicians will seek their votes and will pander to \nthem even as far as granting them some sharia demands as is in the UK now! \nEven now a president like Obama kisses their asses while the muslim \npopulation is still small, imagine how much worse the pandering will be \nwhen they are 30-40%.\n\nAs for the no-go zones: Molenbeek in Belgium has been made famous recently \nas being such a no-go zone, because it was allowed to become a jihadi \nhotspot (from where the attackers in Paris originated), thanks to the fact \nthat the authorities avoided that neighborhood and the likely \nconfrontations that would ensued.\n\nCONCLUSION: Your opinion seems to be that we ought to just play a big \ngamble (with almost zero chances of winning, in my opinion) and just accept \nas many muslims as they want to come and hope that they'll reform, or play \nnice, or remain a small minority, even though this hasn't happend anywhere \nwhere muslims have grown to be a sizable community, even though the west is \nalready feeling the negative effects in terms of increased violence, \nincreased polarization, increased support for the far-right, and even \nthough the outcome of all this will be terrible for everyone involved. \nThat's an awful gamble and I'm afraid we'll all live to regret it."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqhJPQIra1HS-DqXWQRp4Cg", "inappropriate_score": 0.07171029042667623, "authorDisplayName": "Cody Davies", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135wlrw4uiqgrwtx22lgnk4ute1wxotv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T22:09:11.519Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqhJPQIra1HS-DqXWQRp4Cg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.6451020000000001, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T22:09:11.519Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103126706726618863097", "textDisplay": "Sorry for how long this is, I did try to address all your points, though \nit's not exactly in the order you brought them up.\n\nThe first Christian reformation (the new testament) like you say didn't \ncome out of thin air, I recognize that it took hundreds of years for people \nto adopt the new doctrine en masse, however I think you are discounting the \neffect of digital technology and the internet, where ideas and movements \ncan be shared and transferred much quicker to more people; that's what \ngives me hope for a reformation within Islam taking place in the near \nfuture. I liken it to the many stories we've heard about mormons, \nscientologists and catholics going online and learning about their faith \nand abandoning after they find out about the goofy shit their religion \nsubscribes to. I think if we bring the internet to third world countries in \na big way, we can nip radicalism in the bud.\n\nAnd yeah look I'm not saying that a new prophet will come along and just \nwrite a new testament to Islam and people will immediately adopt it; I'm \nsaying that we've seen similar reformations in history so it's by no means \nmiraculous or unachievable - if you had told a dogmatic religious person in \n100 A.D that the new testament was going to be the way of the future, \nthey'd have laughed in your face - so even if it takes hundreds of years it \nis still worth doing (and again I theorize that it could happen much much \nquicker with information technology, social media etc).\n\nI don't know what form an Islamic reformation would take in the modern \nworld - maybe we'll see some kind of 'amendments', maybe we'll be seeing a \nlot of atheists in the coming decades, people leaving the faith, I don't \nknow - but the foundation for a moderate muslim movement is there, it's in \nthe people. And yes a reformed scripture WOULD have to contradict things in \nthe previous scripture and call for new interpretations, much like the new \ntestament contradicts the old. It can be done and should be attempted imo, \nrather than writing off all the individuals within the faith as 'too far \ngone'.\n\nMost people within a religion just parrot the bits they're supposed too; \nI'm not overly worried about muslims who, when asked, express support for \nmore radical ideas. To me that's like catholics saying that you NEED to \nconfess, pray etc ehen we know that just claiming to be catholic doesn't \nmean you actually pray and confess. If we can spread the tools that people \nneed to make rational decisions - scientific method, logical argumentation, \nfact-based philosophies, and sound epistemology - then we can empower the \nmore moderate sections of any faith, including Islam.\nThis is anecdotal, but I always think of a friend of mine - raised \nchristian, church every sunday, never questioning the faith - whose faith \npretty much folded after one decent sized conversation and watching Bill \nMaher's 'Religulous'; You get people to start questioning their faith and \nthe battle is essentially over, they take themselves the rest of the way.\n\nAnd I think you are really discounting the moderate factions of muslims, \nespecially here in the U.S. In my experience from the (admittedly few) \nmuslims I know, however radical their views might be - supporting the \npatriarchy, devout prayer 5 times a day, even the on-the-fence attitude \nsome of them take to apostasy - and I have met muslims and other religious \npeople who when asked, can have an ambivalent attitude toward the \npunishments for apostasy; it's seen as a breach of contract, that you got \nin knowing the punishment for leaving so you got what's coming to you if \nyou do. I can't defend it - it's why we need a reformation - after a \ndiscussion about how most people don't get to CHOSE their religion they're \nraised in it, people become more flexible and lenient on the idea of \napostasy punishment. Just goes to show we need more dialogue on the subject \nwithin muslim spheres imo.\n\nAnd it's supported by polling data that the people who hate daesh the most \nin the world are muslims, presumably because the IS gives muslims such a \nbad name, so any one looking to daesh as an indicator on behaviors and \nattitudes within the muslim world are looking in the wrong place. I think \nthe push back against daesh across the world shows how willing all people \nincluding muslims are to live in peace, and that's why we haven't seen any \nmass uprisings on western soil, especially in America where we've only had \none attack in 15 years; With so many muslims who are supposedly susceptible \nto radicalization, we should be having attacks much more often you'd think, \never week probably; to me the infrequence of terrorist attacks combined \nwith what is usually a stated political motivation (bolstered by religious \nrhetoric) behind said attacks points to other factors besides jihadism \nalone in determining the reasons behind terror attacks.\n\nI'm not trying to ignore problematic sections of scripture, but I think \nthat geopolitical and economic factors have a MUCH larger role in \npredicting violent behavior, as shown by the example of IS fighters' \nincreased absenteeism as their benefits dwindle. If you go into the IS \nhierarchy, it's impressionable young guys looking for adventure and \nbenefits for themselves and friends/family at the bottom, and commanders \nwith political agendas at the top; they all use the quran as a rallying \ncry, but once the fun dries up, those young guys go home as we've been \nstarting to see.\n\nAnd I wouldn't worry about demographic changes so much, since we've seen \nmultiple times in just American history where demographic make-ups are no \nindicator of who has the power; I'm thinking of slavery and jim crow era \nsouthern states, where blacks outnumbered whites in many areas yet still \nhad no political power, or in New York around the turn of the last century \nwhere there were tons and tons of catholic people immigrating in yet still \nholding very little power and living in shitty neighborhoods.\n\nThe only time to ever panic about sharia law is when actual measures start \nappearing on ballots, which we're no where near and I suspect will never \nhappen, as most muslims who come to the U.S do it specifically to ESCAPE \nsharia law. I've never met or heard of any American muslim pushing for the \nhijab or burqa to be adopted by people not in the faith, muslims in America \nbelieve in the separation of church and state as much as any other American \ngroup, it's usually why they come. \n\nIf you are still worried about creeping sharia I would point you to the \nevangelical christian movement and the pushback they get from moderate \nchristians every time they try to infuse our gov't with their religion, and \nI'd say to expect the same kind of pushback not only from people of other \nfaiths but moderate muslims as well. That's the kind of future I see if \nthere ever is a large demographic shift in the coming decades; one where \nradicals try to pass laws but get constantly struck down by the public that \nknows better, because they know where they came from. Essentially the same \nthing we have going now.\n\nAs for the no-go zones...it's not just far-left media that calls it a myth, \neven Fox News had to walk back their claims of no-go zones after finding no \nevidence for them.

You have 2 million+ radicals in the US. By \"radicals\" I don't \nnecessarily mean jihadis, but people who hold iliberal views about the \nworld, such as punishments for apostates, adulterers, homosexuals, critics \nof islam, etc... The fact that you don't see them manifesting this outright \nis because they are still a small percentage of the population and laying \nlow (for now). But when they'll grow in numbers, they'll become as \nin-your-face as they are in Europe, where just a few days before it was \nreported that in Germany they arrested muslim brigades who were roaming the \nstreets \"policing\" people into behaving according to sharia. Or as is in \nBelgium's Molenbeek municipality, which was up until recently a muslim \nno-go zone for the police, and only the terrorist attacks in Paris changed \nthat. Or like the many neighborhood in France, Sweden, UK, etc... where the \npolice dares not to enter anymore (note: these no-go zones are not myths as \nthe far-leftist media wants to portray, they are very real and they're \nemerging in the public view as we speak).\n\n\n2. I know daesh doesn't speak for all muslims (note: I don't like to refer \nto them as isis, because Isis it's a nice female name, and we should be \nclaiming it back). But daesh are very accurately following islam, and, most \nlikely, mohammed would be very proud of them.\nQuote: \" but it's a lot easier to believe in the jihad if you've got \nnothing to lose\". Ah, no: It's a lot easier to ACT according to jihad if \nyou've got nothing to lose. The belief in the validity of jihad is pretty \nmuch independent of whether you have something to lose or not. And that \nbelief by itself is dangerous because you'll never know when it will be put \nin practice.\n\n\n3. Here is a comparison between the reformation of christiany versus islam, \nand why the latter is almost impossible:\n\n- In the case of christianity, the violence and opression originated from \nthe institutions such as the church, papacy and the various kings and \nrulers who claimed divine authority and conducted the crusades and the \ninquisition based on that. These evils did NOT originated from the \nteachings of Jesus. Therefore, the reformation only had to defang these \ninstitutions (via secularization), while leaving the teachings of Jesus \nmostly intact (by the way, the new testament has been compiled gradually in \ntime from original writings dating as far back as 40-150 AD, so it wasn't \njust some new book pulled out of thin air as replacement during the \nreformation).\n\n- In the case of islam, the violence and opression originated (and still \ndoes) from the teachings and actions of mohammed himself, on top of the \nambitions of various rulers and caliphs. Islam doesn't have a central \ninstitution like the papacy to be reformed. Therefore, any reformation \nwould have to amputate and castrate the 'holy' scriptures, that is the \nreligion itself. And there is no \"new quran\" similar to the \"new testament\" \nthat could be compiled from old original writings, especially since in \nislam, ideological innovation is forbidden (haram), and only the words and \nactions of mohammed as described in the quran, the authentic hadiths and \nthe accepted biography are allowed to define islam.\n\n- Conclusion 1: The reformation of islam is a much more difficult (I say \nimpossible) task than the one for christianity, because it requires \nessentially the rejection by muslims of large portions of the quran, the \nhadiths, and the denouncement of mohammed as being an awful historical \nfigure (which he was), as opposed to christianity, where they only had to \nreject the chruch and the kings' divine nature, while leaving the teachings \nof Jesus and his historical image pretty much intact.\n\n- Conclusion 2: The reformation of christianity took a very long time \n(hundreds of years), so one for islam would be in a similar time frame \n(even assuming it's possible, which I don't think so). But we don't have as \nmuch time at our disposal: In some countries in Europe the muslim \npopulation is predicted to reach critical mass (about 30%) by the middle of \nthis century, and as it is observed, they only become more bold and \naggresive as their numbers rise. If the current trend maintains, we'll \nwitness civil wars and genocides in the western world because of this (the \nfar-right is already on the rise in Europe, like a severe allergic reaction \nto the increase in islamization, and very bad things will follow).\n\n\nPS: Look, Donald Trump is a narcissitic, megalomaniacal idiot. But just \nlike the broken clock which is right twice a day, he's right about this. \nThe tragedy is that the PC brigades have scared off all the respectable \npeople who would have taken a stand against islam, leaving only wacky ones \nlike Trump to carry the banner in this topic. This is a very important \nmatter, and we can't allow the destruction of the western world in the \nvague hope that, somehow, by some miracle, the muslim population will \nreject the current version of the quran, and the image of mohammed, and \nadopt some defanged \"'neo-quran\" in its place."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqhJPQIra1HS-DqXWQRp4Cg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Cody Davies", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135wlrw4uiqgrwtx22lgnk4ute1wxotv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T04:22:11.335Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqhJPQIra1HS-DqXWQRp4Cg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8237598, "formal_score": 11, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T04:22:11.335Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103126706726618863097", "textDisplay": "I never said we should not get people to question their beliefs, that is \nthe best thing we can do which is why its important to stick up for free \nspeech etc. Give me a chance to respond because you have some valid points \nbut I think you're underestimating the prospect of an Islamic reformation \ngiven what we've seen in history.\n\n1. You don't know the individual ideologies of all muslims - just saying \nyou're a muslim doesn't mean you ascribe to the the violent aspects, which \nI agree you'd have to interpret things differently, for example rather than \n\"fight the infidel\" it needs to be interpreted as \"fight the infidel...with \nideas and words\". If christianity and judaism can do it, so can islam, and \nrational muslims have already come to that conclusion. Just look around in \nAmerica, we don't have suicide bombings or frequent terror attacks even \nthough we have somewhere between 5 and 10 million muslims who live in the \nU.S; if the quran was as evil as you say, and muslims as weak morally as \nyou imply, we should have something like 2 million radicals within our \nborders - you would have noticed that.\n\n2. Isis doesn't speak for ALL muslims any more than the The Army of God \nspeaks for ALL christians, they use religion to hook vulnerable people in \n(which I'm not arguing is a hard thing to do since the quran obviously has \nviolent parts, I won't argue that it's a stretch to find violence in the \nbook). However It can be argued that even those within Isis aren't 'true \nbelievers' and are joining up for the earthly benefits in an impoverished \narea - food, healthcare, adventure, money, slaves, etc - and the evidence \nfor that is the increasing amount of absenteeism within the IS as their \nbenefits dwindle and their pay keeps getting cut; if they are abandoning \ntheir posts the second things get tough that means they weren't in it for \nthe jihad half as much as the benefits. If the region were more stable, \nIsis would have no draw, and it's important not to forget the role our \ngov't has had in destabilizing the area and pretty much driving people into \nIsis' arms. I'm not saying they don't believe the jihad, but it's a lot \neasier to believe in the jihad if you've got nothing to lose. \n\n3. You're right that the teachings of Jesus don't preach about violence \nlike the quran does, but the bible has the old testament as well. It took a \nREFORMATION and a whole new book of the bible to change the way people \nworshiped and believed about violence's role in spreading beliefs. When I \ntalk about reformation I'm not just talking about the protestant \nreformation - which had to be undergone EVEN THOUGH the new testament tried \nto be less violent (goes to show how people can twist scripture to mean \nanything they want) - I'm talking about the first reformation, the \ninclusion of the new testament. So much in the same way as the new \ntestament contradicts the old in christianity, we need a new testament of \nIslam to correct the intolerance of the old.\n\nLike I said I'm an atheist too so if all the religions went away I'd be \nhappy, but Islam isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and since there are so \nmany non-violent muslims who recognize that Islam has problematic aspects, \nI think the foundation exists for a massive nonviolent reformation within \nIslamist cultures and we should do what we can to facilitate that, rather \nthan strawmanning all muslims and feeding fuel to the jihadi fire."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aGz05cRyFuPLXK1exuieQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "axpetre", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135wlrw4uiqgrwtx22lgnk4ute1wxotv", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-05T23:38:17.232Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_aGz05cRyFuPLXK1exuieQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9059155999999999, "formal_score": 61, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-05T23:38:17.232Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109898196764826529243", "textDisplay": "+Cody Davies Why shouldn't we judge christians for belonging to an evil \norganization guilty of crusades and the inquisition?\n1. When I'm speaking about muslims I'm refering to them belonging to an \nideology NOT to an organization (the way you stated in your question). This \nis a big difference because an organization may twist that ideology into \nunrecognizable forms, which may contradict its original teachings.\n2. The ideology of christianity as exemplified by the actions of Jesus, \ndoesn't encourage, instruct or even condone such actions as the crusades \nand the inquisition. By contrast, islam does encourage such actions as \nviolent jihad and opression of non-muslims as exemplified by the teachings \nand actions of mohammed and his companions.\n\nAs for islamic reformation, that is not possible, because the teachings of \nmohammed are inherently violent and evil, so you would have to contradict \nislam itself in order to reform it. This was not the case with \nchristianity, because the teaching of Jesus, while bizarre and stupid, are \nnot instructing people to kill and opress non-christians (or anyone, for \nthat matter).\n\nAbout the point that muslims hold radical beliefs because of the \nauthoritarian nature of their country, that is also inaccurate, for \nexample: young muslims in the UK believe in proportion of 68% that people \nwho criticise their religion should be at least prosecuted for expressing \nsuch views. This is a radical view and it emerges from a country which is \nnot authoritarian. And such views are common in the rest of the muslim \ncommunities from europe. Therefore, it's not just authoritarian regimes \nwhich cause radicalism, it's just islam in its pure form.\n\nAnd then you go back to your point with blaming all for the actions of a \nfew, the same as your previous example with blaming all blacks for the \nactions of the few criminal ones, which I already explained in the previous \nreply that it is not what I'm doing.\n\nAnd no, it's not ok to judge christians because of the few radicals who \nkill, especially since christianty is not supporting such actions, whereas \nislam does (daesh, aka isis is commiting atrocities because islam, not in \nspite of it).\n\nIslam is very much akin to fascism: it's authoritarian, supremacistic, \noppresive, divisive, violent and genocidal. This has to be aknowledge \nbefore we move forward.

And the isolationism and hostility to integration and \nsociety is often as a result of their interpretation of that text. So I am \nnot saying it is entirely because the rest of society rejects them. I think \npeople within society should be more active in integrating them, and there \nshould be more programs in place to do so. The more people feel apart of \nsomething, the more likely they will make active attempts to integrate into \nit. This means setting aside more of their beliefs, especially if they are \nfundamentalist beliefs.\nI have seen with my own eyes how Muslims can integrate within society, I \nknow people within my own town who are Muslim and don't follow their holly \nbooks text in that way. They are not fundamentalist. They do not believe in \nfollowing it to the letter. They are friends and family with people who are \nnot Muslim. Just like Christians and other religions, people who are Muslim \ncan integrate into society without following Fundamentalist beliefs.\nAlso people may (and often do) follow only certain parts of said text. So \nthey don't go around attacking infidels, but they do follow treat women in \na poor way.\nAs I said, I disagree with all fundamentalism so all the bits that are part \nof that text can be thrown out the window as far as I am concerned. Ban \nthem, filter them out, etc.\nIt is possible to socially engineer the situation to where Sharia law is \nnot accepted and is further marginalised. We are doing it, we are \nexplaining to the future generation why it makes no sense. They are \nlistening, and in turn further abandoning their parents and families \nfundamentalism.\nSadly its still exists within society, I feel tempted to say gtfo out to \nthose who hold onto those belief's as well. But underneath that bollox they \nare just people, and people can change. And are changing.\nBesides which, I really hope religion in general will be reduced hugely in \nfuture generations. We are already seeing signs of it. Its mostly in the \nolder generation and those who are younger and hold beliefs are generally \nmore liberal about their beliefs. The writing is on the wall for \nfundamentalism in our societies. Not yet but soon it will be seen as so \nridiculous, by Muslims within our society that it will be gone entirely \nfrom here.

Of \ncourse not so the Muslim ban will be permanent and any American Muslim \ntraveling abroad won't be allowed back in. That's called making America \ngreat again. Meanwhile our drones with 90% error rate will guarantee enough \ncivilian causalities to perpetually generate more terrorists we will train \nand arm through covert CIA gun running operations. Does one of these things \nsound more stupid than the other? No, they are both equally stupid. Should \nwe fear all Muslims? No, not any more than we fear evangelical Christians \nand they scare the fuck out me with all their racism and homophobia, I \ntrust Muslims more because I know less about them and I want to keep it \nthat way.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z124ehoinvasywo0kvrczzbh1t3jihvs1": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCregjspAoF4oyXPMstqHxlg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "floriswazza", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-08T09:49:20.380Z", "videoId": "eXdpgG8szq4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCregjspAoF4oyXPMstqHxlg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.27442799999999995, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2016-05-08T09:49:20.380Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112483346915796665915", "textDisplay": "Take it from someone who has experienced living with muslims.

Of course they have the right to \nvoice their opinions and I defend their rights to do so, but trump had \nevery right to kick them out. And no, NOT all of them were peaceful \nprotesters. Again I ask, where are the trump supporters crashing Bernie \nrallies? It isn't happening. \n\nNo I don't support Ted Cruz, or his insane religious beliefs, I am an \natheist. \n\nEurope IS in the process of cultural suicide since native Europeans don't \nreally have children, while Muslim migrants have five or six children, \nsometimes more. With current immigration patterns and child bearing rates \nremaining the way they are now, Sweden will be a Muslim majority country by \n2049. That IS cultural suicide. YOU cannot see what is down the road my \nfriend. Like most leftists you bury your head in the sand and insist that \neverything is just fine. How do you explain the rise in terrorism across \nthe western world? That has nothing to do with the FACT that the Qur'an and \nhadiths both tell Muslims to kill infidels? It's all because of U.S. \nforeign policy right? \n\nAnd no, you asshole, I'm not a bigot. I live in Toledo, Ohio, which has one \nof the highest Muslim populations in America. Most of the Muslims I run \ninto on a day to day basis, seem like decent folks. However, when you see \nMuslims become the majority, whatever country that is tends to execute \ngays, subjugate women, and kill or criminalize atheists. All I am saying, \nand many like me are saying, is that we need to, especially in Europe, is \nhit the pause button on Muslim immigrants. The immigrants who are already \nhere in the west need more time to assimilate and westernize. I am more \nthan happy to have Muslim neighbours as long as they share my secular \nvalues, which really isn't much to ask. What you see in Europe are Muslim \nimmigrants ghettoizing into homogenous communities and failing to \nassimilate. It is possible today for a Muslim child to be born and raised \nin England and have NO native English friends. That is a problem. Please \ndon't pretend that the western world is in any way comparable to the Muslim \nworld. The west IS the best and we shouldn't be afraid to point that out. \nWe're not perfect, but at least we don't execute gays and atheists anymore. \nAlso, you completely failed to address my points about black crime in \nAmerica and how delusional Bernie is when he insists that we are still a \ndeeply racist country. Despite our past failures in race relations, America \nis THE BEST place in the world for black people to live. They have more \nrights here than they do in any other country. Why should white people \ntoday take all the blame for what some white people did in the past? Are \nyou not aware that the slaves that were sold to the Muslim world, which by \nthe way were far greater than what were sent to America, we're treated FAR \nworse than the slaves sent to America? The reason there are no black people \nin the middle east is because the Muslim slave masters of the day, neutered \nthe black men like dogs. But o yeah, Americans were much worse right?

Monkey's will rain \nfrom the sky before Bernie becomes president. You might say that's because \nmost Americans over the age of twenty five are retarded, I think it's the \nopposite. Most people over the age of twenty five live in reality and see \nright through all the false promises made by politicians. Government is NOT \nthe answer, less government is! I am a millennial myself (24) and realize \nhow STUPID and ENTITLED far too many people are in my generation. The \ngovernment is incredibly inefficient and incompetent and will only result \nin lesser quality services whenever they get involved. You seem to have \nfallen for the myth that Europe and Canada are better than the U.S.\n\nIn Canada recently a man was imprisoned and sued for tweeting anti feminist \nspeech. Is that \"progressive\" to you? Bernie and his supporters represent \nthe true fascists my friend. You don't see Trump supporters crashing Bernie \nrallies do you? It is Bernie supporters who crash Trump rallies, calling \neveryone there racist and instigating fights only to have the media show \n\"how violent\" Trump supporters are. If you start shit, don't be surprised \nwhen the other person throws down, this is common sense. The most anti free \nspeech people are on the left and tend to support Bernie, which is why I \nhave shifted more to the right. Bernie wants us to be more like Europe, \nwhich is a TERRIBLE idea considering Europe is in the process of cultural \nsuicide, encouraging mass Muslim immigration while demonizing the native \npeople for objecting to it. I have two daughters and am an atheist, support \ngay rights and women's rights. Most Muslims are anti me, therefore I say \nthey should stay in their own damn countries. How many terror attacks need \nto happen before you leftists realize that Islam IS a problem? 1.1 billion \nMuslims in the world support sharia law, which includes death penalties for \napostasy, adultery and severe punishments for theft and thought crimes. I'm \nnot against allowing small numbers of Muslims into our countries but what \nEurope is doing, especially Germany and Sweden, is CULTURAL SUICIDE. Oh but \nlet me guess, because I hold this rationally thought out belief, I'm a \nracist right?\n\nHow many Muslims do YOU live by? A few Muslim neighbours are just fine, but \nwhen they get into a majority or even a large minority, huge problems \narise. Look at the rape epidemic is Sweden and Germany as a prime example. \nThe fact that native Swede and German women are becoming afraid to leave \ntheir homes, is a disgrace and shows the absolute failure of \nmulticulturalism. Angela Merkel and her ilk enjoy their liberal, wealthy, \nhomogenous communities while condemning their own people who actually have \nto live with their governments suicidal immigration policy. Disgraceful. \nBernie is just like Angela Merkel and doesn't seem to think allowing tens \nof thousands of backward Muslims into America would have any problems. He's \nmore worried about \"islamophobia\" than he is about global jihad. Again, \ndisgraceful.

Believe me I used to be head \nover heels in love with Bernie when he first entered the race and still \nagree with many of his premises like wealth inequality and the lack of paid \nmaternal and paternal leave, I just think that the expanding the state is a \nhorrible idea. Look at Detroit as a prime example. Fifty years ago it was \nthe wealthiest and fastest growing city in the U.S. It has been exclusively \nrun by democrats since 1961, and was among the first cities to implement \nsocial welfare policies. Can you honestly blame Detroit's problems on \nconservative policies? The same can be said for Chicago, Baltimore, St. \nLouis and others. If you want every city to turn out like Detroit, Bernie \nand the Democrats are your people. \n\nRaising taxes on the wealthy sounds like a simple cure all, but what do you \nthink the wealthy are going to do? They WILL leave like they do in every \ncountry where socialism is implemented and take all the jobs they produce \nwith them, thus extending misery to even more Americans. The government \ndoes NOT create jobs, people do. Also, I must ask, why do YOU have so much \nfaith in the state, when they repeatedly prove how incompetent they are? \nWhy do you have faith in Bernie? He didn't even have a job until he was \nforty and has been a professional noise maker in Senate for decades. What \nlegislation was he successful in passing? I know he passed one piece of \nlegislation aimed at helping veterans, which of course is great, but other \nthan that, what has he accomplished? \n\nBernie is delusional and weak. He kowtows to black lives matter, who make \nit seem that racist white cops are the biggest problem in the black \ncommunity despite the FACT the NUMBER ONE cause of death for young black \nmales is young black males. He wouldn't dare bring up the startling fact \nthat young black males comprise around 3 to 4 percent of the population, \nyet commit 54 percent of total murders. THAT is the biggest problem in the \nblack community which stems from the breakdown of the intact, nuclear black \nfamily, which was caused by welfare programs in the 60's which made it \ndesirable for black women to marry the state rather than black men.\n\nWhy on earth do people feel ENTITLED to things. Life isn't fair and nobody \nowes you anything! As soon as people realize that, the sooner they will \nbecome successful. Bernie believes in institutional racism today in 2016, \nwhich really doesn't exist! If you feel that it does, give me ONE example \nof a law that is specifically in place to keep black people oppressed, \nbesides welfare of course. Black people are more than capable of being \nsuccessful and making excuses for the violent crimes they commit is \nshameful and cowardly. Slavery and poverty are NOT excuses. More white \npeople are in poverty than blacks yet their crime rate is drastically \nlower. There is NO EXCUSE for murder, rape, robbery, assault, arson, etc. I \ndon't care what color the perpetrators skin is. Democrats, especially \nBernie, have not ONCE told people they need to be responsible for their own \nactions and STOP COMMITTING CRIMES. There is a reason black people are \ndisproportionately represented in prisons and it isn't because of racism. \nEvery black criminal receives the same treatment that white criminals do. \nThey all get a fair and speedy trial. If the evidence finds them guilty, \nthey go to prison. If black folks want the cops to leave them alone, they \nshould STOP COMMITTING CRIMES! Get a job and make something of yourself. \nNobody every gave me anything and I'm successful now BECAUSE I have worked \nVERY HARD to get to where I am. Why should we raise the minimum wage for \npeople who don't have skills or education? That would hurt small business \nmore than anything, resulting in less jobs. If people want to make more \nmoney, they should learn a skill or get educated. Millions of people in \nthis country simply don't want to put in the effort that I have put in and \ninstead expect \"free\" handouts. I say fuck them. UPS is ALWAYS hiring. \nThere is a massive need for specialists in HVAC, electrician and plumbing \nprofessions yet people complain there are no jobs? Some people are just \nlazy and it is immoral to demand that I, under pain of imprisonment, \nsubsidize their laziness. This is why socialism fails, it disincentives \nhard work and rewards laziness. \n\n"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGSdlvypoHRTGBHyZ-4glbA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kuypers125", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134dlb4zmfpsrgbr04cdx4ibknycjowepc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-08T03:56:18.463Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGSdlvypoHRTGBHyZ-4glbA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.596374, "formal_score": 14, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-08T04:09:22.100Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106947829461852866098", "textDisplay": "+Alen Snell\n\"Bernie is an old\"\nYou do realise that Bernie is only a year or two older than Trump/Hillary?\n\"incompetent, \"\ncite your source\n\"commie.\"\nSince when?\nHe's center left at best, Communism is *way far* left.\nBernie is Pro-capitalism\nA Communist wouldn't be\n\n\"Centralized control always leads to corruption and greed\"\nThe fact that you said that as an attack against Bernie tells me that \nyou've bought into the rightwing's strawman of him & have no clue what he \nactually stands for.\n\nThe only sectors he wants centralised *that aren't already* are Education & \nHealthcare.\nHe fully supports keeping everything else just as decentralised as it is \ntoday, and is even pushing for *even more decentralisation* In the \nfinancial sector.\n\nFYI, literally every other 1st World Nation has no problem with at least \npartially-centralised healthcare so the rest of us really don't understand \nwhy so many of you Americans are violently against the idea.\n\n\".

It \nfurther states that Malik ibn Anas objected on those narratives of Hisham, \nwhich were reported through people of Iraq. Another book on the narrators \nof the traditions of the Muhammad reports that when he was old, Hisham\u2019s \nmemory suffered quite badly.\n\nWe find evidence in both Hadith books and history books that indicates \nAisha must have been older than nine when she got married:\n\nAccording to a hadith in Bukhari and Muslim, Aisha is said to have joined \nMuhammad on the raid that culminated in the Battle of Badr, in 624 CE. \nHowever, because no one below the age of fifteen was allowed to accompany \nraiding parties, Aisha should have been at least fifteen in 624 CE and thus \nat least thirteen when she was married following the Hijra in 622 CE.\n\nIbn Hisham\u2019s version of Ibn Ishaq\u2019s Sirat Rashul Allah, the earliest \nsurviving biography of Muhammad, records Aisha as having converted to Islam \nbefore Umar ibn al-Khattab, during the first few years of Islam around 610 \nCE. In order to accept Islam she must have been walking and talking, hence \nat least three years of age, which would make her at least fifteen in 622 \nCE.\n\nTabari reports that Abu Bakr wished to spare Aisha the discomforts of a \njourney to Ethiopia soon after 615 CE, and tried to bring forward her \nmarriage to Mut`am\u2019s son. Mut`am refused because Abu Bakr had converted to \nIslam, but if Aisha was already of marriageable age in 615 CE, she must \nhave been older than nine in 622 CE.\n\nTabari also reports that Abu Bakr\u2019s four children were all born during the \nJahiliyyah (Pre-Islam Period), which has ended in 610 CE, making Aisha at \nleast twelve in 622 CE.\nAccording to Ibn Hajar, Fatima was five years older than Aisha. Fatima is \nreported to have been born when Muhammad was thirty-five years old, meaning \nAisha was born when he was forty years old, and thus twelve when Muhammad \nmarried at fifty-two.\n\nAccording to the generally accepted tradition, Aisha was born about eight \nyears before Hijrah (Migration to Medina). However, according to another \nnarrative in Bukhari (Kitaab al-Tafseer) Aisha is reported to have said \nthat at the time Surah Al-Qamar, the 54th chapter of the Qur\u2019an , was \nrevealed, \u201cI was a young girl\u201d. The 54th Surah of the Qur\u2019an was revealed \nnine years before Hijrah. According to this tradition, Aisha had not only \nbeen born before the revelation of the referred Surah, but was actually a \nyoung girl, not even only an infant at that time. So if this age is assumed \nto be 7 to 14 years, then her age at the time of marriage would be 14 to 21.\n\nAccording to almost all the historians, Asma the elder sister of Aisha, was \nten years older than Aisha. It is reported in Taqreeb al-Tehzeeb as well as \nin Ibn Kathir's Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah that Asma died in the 73rd year \nafter migration of Muhammad when she was 100 years old. Now, obviously if \nAsma was 100 years old in the 73rd year after Migration to Medina, she \nshould have been 27 or 28 years old at the time of migration. If Asma was \n27 or 28 years old at the time of hijrah, Aisha should have been 17 or 18 \nyears old at that time. Thus, if Aisha got married in year 1 AH or 2 AH \n(after Migration to Medina), she must have been between 18 to 20 years old \nat the time of her marriage.\n\nAccording to many Ahadith in Bukhari, it is believed Aisha participated in \nthe both of Badr and Uhud battles. Furthermore, in Bukhari's \nKitabu\u2019l-Maghazi, Ibn `Umar states: \"The Prophet did not permit me to \nparticipate in Uhud battle, as at that time, I was 14 years old. But on the \nday of Khandaq battle, when I was 15 years old, the Prophet permitted my \nparticipation\". So, since it was not allowed for Muslims younger than 15 \nyears old to participate in Uhud battle, Aisha, who participated in Uhud, \nmust have been at least 15 years old in those battles; thus her age was at \nleast 13 to 14 at the time of her marriage.\n\nAccording to ibn Sa\u2019d's Tabaqat and Ansab al-Ashraf books, opinions are in \ndisagreement concerning her marriage with Muhammad. The marriage seems to \nhave taken place either two of five years after the Migration (Usd \nal-Ghaba, 5:501)."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA-o1oSNdivdyrBXbj9hCcw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Gran Darf", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xhzsiol3igj5q504cftzrzraxifejuys0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T00:01:38.780Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCA-o1oSNdivdyrBXbj9hCcw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.7532620000000001, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T00:01:38.780Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GDpbcdZaAHg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/oAjyzcdXC1s/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113699315896811487120", "textDisplay": "+NeverGoingTo GiveYouUp And even if we completely disregard Aisha.

You can't convert to \n\"being white\" \"White\" people do not commit mass shootings. people who \nbelieve in Islam DO commit religiously motivated attacks BECAUSE of their \nreligion. people believe X or Y or they don't. The pew reseach polls show \nwhat people in countries believe about woment as property, penalties for \napostasy, homosexuality, etc. And when X or Y is connected to performing \nviolent acts it makes sense you would want some kind of security for people \nmoving into a country. Screening based on ethnicity is stupid and wrong and \ntha is akin to racism. Screening based on religious belief which can be \nbelived by any ethnicity or race is not the same thing. That's not the same \nthing as profiling people already living here by the way which has \nadditional constitutional issues with 4th amendment. etc. But people who \nare not citizens having some kind of screening process is not a bad idea. \nBan is too strong a word because it supposes indefinite discrimination \nforever But that's the point Trump is an idiot.

I\u2019ll type it out for you. \n\nFrom 1.45 (perhaps you should listen along) he says, \u201cSo for example, you \n(Trump) keep saying \u201cI\u2019m doing common sense and I\u2019m keeping it real and I\u2019m \ndoing what\u2019s right..\u201d \u2013 No, if you take that position \u2013 you are a bigot. \nBecause what you\u2019re saying is I AM GOING TO BLAME ALL muslims for the \nactions of a few. Now, you know there are times when people accuse people \nof blaming all muslims and they\u2019re not blaming all muslims so it\u2019s not an \naccurate response. In this case you can read his fucking press release\u2026 \nwhere it said \u201cwe are going to stop muslims from coming into the US \u2013 a \ntotal and complete shutdown of muslims.. a temporary ban on all muslims \nfrom the reaching the US, until we figure out what is going on\u201d So that \nmeans Donald Trump is blaming (different types of muslims) for the actions \nof (other types of muslims)\u2026. BECAUSE YOU\u2019RE BLAMING ALL OF THEM \u2013 the \ndefinition of bigotry.\u201d End of quote. That deals with point 1. Get out the \nstraw man..!! \n\nPoint 2 \u2013 look at results of surveys taken in the muslim world. \nConservative numbers show 30% to 40% of the world\u2019s muslims support shariah \nlaw being imposed in western countries and / or violence in defence of \nmohammad (eg. Killing cartonnists for blasphemy). Thanks for noting muslims \nkill other muslims \u2013 imagine what they do with non-muslims when they find \nthem. Next you\u2019ll be telling me that ISIS don\u2019t really believe the \nteachings of the kuran \u2013 they\u2019re just freedom fights for the socially and \neconomically disadvantaged\u2026 \n\nPoint 3 \u2013 I never said I agreed with a blanket ban of muslims. And clearly \nsuch a ban could never be considered progressive. But its not surprising \nyou'd assert that given how well you've done on points 1 and 2.

I believe the reason Muslim countries have \nturned out this way IS BECAUSE of dictatorships and shitty politics. Iran \nhad a democracy- but it was overthrown in an American and British coup to \nput in the Shah. 16 years after that coup the Islamic Revolution happened- \nwhich probably wouldn't have happened if foreign imperialist powers hadn't \ninterfered in Iranian politics in the first place (to get at our oil). \nAnother myth is the Sunni-Shi'a conflict. The Americans say the conflict \nstems from sectarianism- but this is an oversimplification. In Iraq before \nthe war there was ZERO Sunni-Shi'a tension. Intermarriages were common and \nneither group ever attacked the other. In fact even now in Iraq only a \nminority of people are sectarian - the vast majority of Iraqi people don't \nhate each other because of religion - it's just money and power. The reason \nwhy SOME Sunni and Shiites attacked each other after Saddam's removal was \nbecause Saddam had given special privileges to the Sunni's. Not because he \nactually cared that they were Sunni (Saddam was never religious)- but \nbecause Saddam was afraid the Shi'a would be more loyal to Iran (his \nregional foe) rather than him. So he persecuted the Shi'a and boosted the \nSunni's to gain their loyalty. Then when Democracy came to Iraq and the \nShi'a took control (because they are the majority), the Sunni's lost their \nprivileges and felt marginalized (since they had lost their power and now \nhad to play fair). Thus a minority in the Sunni community formed ISIS and \ntook up arms to fight the Iraqi government. If Iraq had been a democracy \nfrom the start and not had a brutal dictator- then the balance of power \nwould never have been shifting back and forth so much to pit groups against \none another.

Our politicians and \ncorporations from our countries fuck up poor countries constantly, and then \npeople from those countries flee to our countries. It become even more \ndifficult to unify the working class in first world countries when the \nworkers are divided into different cultures, and third world people are not \nas likely to fight back against imperialism when they have the opportunity \nto become first world people themselves. Thus, immigration is a part of a \nbigger pattern, that protect the power of the capitalist class.\n\nAs for those policies that make it appealing to immigrate to western \nnations though, we need the welfare state. Without the welfare state, \npeople will be dependent of their families for their socio-economic \nsecurity. One reason why we have so modern values here in Sweden, is that \nwe have a long tradition of a strong welfare state. Since we did not have \nto rely on our relatives for our socio-economic security, we became \nindividualistic towards the family. Most Muslim immigrants however, come \nfrom countries with little to no welfare systems. Thus, they tend to be \ncollectivistic towards the family, since they are used to having to rely on \nit more.\n\nThe fact that we still have welfare systems (even if the politicians has \nbeen pulling them down slowly since the 80\u00b4s) means that children of \nimmigrants who wants to revolt aginst the culture of their parents can do \nso, without having to worry about starving or freezing to death. If we cut \nmore in our welfare systems, it will become easier for immigrants to \npressure their children, for example into staying in their religion or \naccepting arranged marriages.

Anyway, for not following is to have them \nkilled by stoning. Don't try to justify as \"the punishment for sin blah \nblah blah\". It's a command to murder non-jews/christians. Simple as that. \nIt's death for difference of belief. It doesn't say kill only those who \ncommit incest or whatever. It says \"any\", so yeah, this is a command to \nkill ANY of those are following any other religious practice.\n\nLuke 19:27\n\n\"Jesus mentions his ultimate victory over the unbelieving and rebellious.\" \n.. \"it has to do with their ultimate fate.\"\n\nWhich this ultimate fate isn't described as to \"slay\" them ? What does it \nmean to \"slay\"? Kill. Why are they being killed? Rejection. You and I both \nagree this verse is talking about non-Christians, yes?\n\nMatthew 10:34\n\n\"He came separate people into those who would follow him and those who \nwould reject him.\"\n\"If you are not with Christ, then you are against him.\"\n\nAnd we learned above how Jesus handles rejection like a psycho \nex-girlfriend. He has them killed. In other words without sugar-coating it, \nhe plans to have non-believers, non-Christians, non-followers. etc \n*murdered. Whether or not you think this killing is justified is irrelevant.\n\nLeviticus 24:16\n\n\"Israelites revered the name of God so highly that they refused to \npronounce it and removed some of the letters when they wrote it, leaving \nonly the unpronounceable YHWH.

I'm sure you're aware of verses that \ndoes specifically command the people mentioned to killed by law for those \nfollowers, yes? Clearly in that verse it depicts people that have no \ninterest in following this religion. Why would a non-Christian value \nChristian law over societal law? For example, you and I likely won't agree \non what our nation's laws and policies should be at times. Many of your \nreasons would come from primarily from your religious beliefs, right? You \nlikely believe in objective morality. I don't. I think it's up to us. I'm \nsure you see abortion as murder. I don't. I see these death penalty laws \nyour book commands to be murder.

In \nthis respect, the United States has 4.7 deaths per 100,000.

We were sending out \nmissionaries to the Native Americans and overseas even before we were \nactually a nation.\nOur public school system was originally founded to teach kids to read the \nBible.\nMany of our first colleges and universities (Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, \netc.) were founded to train church leaders.\nYou can even look at the fourth verse of our national anthem.\n\n\"O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand\nBetween their loved homes and the war's desolation.\nBlest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land\nPraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\nAnd this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.'\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\"\n\n\n\"You are NOT morally superior and you NEVER will be.\"\n\nBy what standard do you determine what is morally superior or inferior?\n\n\n\"White xtians commit the most crimes in America.\"\n\nProbably because we are the largest part of the population.\n\n\n\"Deny it all you want, for you only prove your inferiority.\"\n\nI think it's cute that you believe yourself to be superior to anyone.\nI believe everyone is created equally in the image of God and his likeness. \nSkin color, nationality, or anything else is irrelevant.\nI don't see myself or anyone else as superior or inferior.\n\n\n\"As for skin color, it is monumental dumbfucks like you that are obsessed \nwith that subject.

The hand of the witnesses \nshall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of \nall the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.\"\n\nThis is the same sort of law we have today in our judicial system. If \nsomeone does wrong, then you need to inquire diligently and have witnesses.\n\nIn this case, the wickedness was being committed by pagans who served other \ngods. They engaged in such acts as bestiality, incest, and child sacrifice.\n\nThis has little to do with their religions and everything to do with what \nthey practiced.\n\n. . . .\n\nLuke 19:27\n\nWell, you give the last verse of the parable of the ten minas.\n\"from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. But as for \nthese enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them \nhere and slaughter them before me. And when he had said these things, he \nwent on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.\"\n\nNotice how no one was actually killed here.\nJesus mentions his ultimate victory over the unbelieving and rebellious. \nThey who will not have Him to reign over them will learn that He does \nreign, and having shut Love out, will themselves be shut out from Love.\n\nThis has nothing to do with any murder or subjugation of unbelieves. \nRather, it has to do with their ultimate fate.\n\n. . . .\n\nMatthew 10:34\n\nI love how you completely ignore the very next things Jesus says.\n\n\"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come \nto bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his \nfather, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against \nher mother-in-law. And a person\u2019s enemies will be those of his own \nhousehold. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, \nand whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And \nwhoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever \nfinds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will \nfind it.\"\n\nWhat does a sword do? It cuts or divides.\nJesus didn't come to bring all people's together. He came separate people \ninto those who would follow him and those who would reject him.\nIf you are not with Christ, then you are against him.\n\nAlso, this again, has nothing to do with murdering or subjugating \nnonbelievers.\n\n\n. . . .\n\nLeviticus 24:16\n\n\"Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death. All \nthe congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when \nhe blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.\"\n\nYes, blasphemy was a capital offense. This is for both natives and \nsojourners alike in Israel.\n\nIt was law, just like we have laws today.\nBelievers and nonbelievers were treated equally under this law.\n\nThis has nothing to do with any murder or subjugation of nonbelievers. You \ncan disagree with the law is you like, but it doesn't help your case that \nthe Bible teaches to murder or subjugate nonbelievers.\n\nNow, why was blasphemy such a high crime?\nTo the Hebrews, a name wasn't just a convenient label. It was a symbolic \nrepresentation of a person's character. Israelites revered the name of God \nso highly that they refused to pronounce it and removed some of the letters \nwhen they wrote it, leaving only the unpronounceable YHWH. The man in \nLeviticus who blasphemed God's name was stoned to death.\n\n. . . .\n\nRomans 1:24-32\n\n\n\"Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to \nthe dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged \nthe truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather \nthan the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.\"\n\nBoy, does that should familiar. I see so much impurity and people \ndishonoring their own bodies and going after lies instead of God's truth. \nOne specific instance is worshipping the creature over the Creator.\n\nSo, where does this have anything to do with murdering or subjugating \nnonbelievers.\n\nThe closest thing I could see from your perspective would be \"Though they \nknow God\u2019s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to \ndie, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.\"\n\nHowever, this has no command to murder anyone. All have sinned and fallen \nshort of God. The wages (something we earn) of sin is eternal death.\nWe deserve eternal death (hell), but the free gift of God is eternal life \nthrough Christ.\n\nGod won't force you to follow him. You know the penalty of sin. You make \nyour own choice.\nTurn away from your sins and to Christ for the forgiveness of sins. Or, \nremain a slave to your sin and pay the penalty of your sins yourself.\nIt's your choice.\n\n. . . .\n\nIsaiah 14:21\n\n\nThe command may be addressed to the Medes of Isaiah 13:17, or to any \nminister of the Divine vengeance. In the judgment of God, as seen in \nhistory, that judgment falls necessarily on the last members of an evil and \ncruel dynasty. In this sense the sins of the fathers are visited on the \nchildren, while, in the eternal judgment which lies behind the veil, each \nsingle soul stands, as in Ezekiel 18:4, on its own personal responsibility, \nand may win pardon for itself. Penitent or impenitent (and the latter seems \nhere implied), the children of the evil-doers should cease to be conquerors \nand rulers.\n\nNow, I'm sure how this helps your case that the Bible commands murder or \nsubjugation of nonbelievers. It says nothing of nonbelievers, but of \nevil-doers.\n\n. . . .\n\nIsaiah 13:15-18\n\n\nYah, that's what the Medes were going to do and what they did.\n\nThere is no command for any believer to murder or subjugate nonbelievers.\n\n. . . .\n\n\nNumbers 25:1-9\n\n\"When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose \nand left the congregation and took a spear in his hand and went after the \nman of Israel into the chamber and pierced both of them, the man of Israel \nand the woman through her belly. Thus the plague on the people of Israel \nwas stopped. Nevertheless, those who died by the plague were twenty-four \nthousand.\"\n\nOk, so one pagan woman was killed along with a man of Israel. And the \nplague from pagan wickedness caused the deaths of 24,000 Israelis.\n\nSo, yes, a single nonbelieving woman was killed (though, not murdered as \nshe was not innocent).\nBy the way, this has no command to kill anyone. It records what Phinehas \ndid.\n\n. . . .\n\n\"would you like more? There's definitely more.\"\n\nVery few of what you did give me had any real relevance to your case. If \nyou want to give me more, great. But, please do your due diligence and \nactually give me something that is relevant to your claims.\nYou gave me nothing that really said anything  bad about the Bible.\nIf that's the best you have then you should really rethink your opinion of \nJudaism and Christianity."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDonLNKf6_KA9Qlal3Qu3zQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jacob Frye", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ei3zxoyq3h1q4e04cffmikrupwzzpesk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T10:09:18.950Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDonLNKf6_KA9Qlal3Qu3zQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8026118000000001, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T10:09:18.950Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6cRXHszUfRU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAERg/oDROkcWW4AA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107813004010360275557", "textDisplay": "+Explosive Sasquatch\nI've dealt with them all and they all crumble when presented with facts.

Here \nyou go;\n\nDeuteronomy 17\nIf there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God \ngiveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the \nLORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant; 17:3 And hath gone and served \nother gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the \nhost of heaven, which I have not commanded; 17:4 And it be told thee, and \nthou hast heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, \nand the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel; 17:5 \nThen shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed \nthat wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt \nstone them with stones, till they die.\n\nLuke 19:27:\nBut those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, \nbring hither, and slay them before me.\n\nMatthew 10:34:\nThink not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, \nbut a sword.\n\nLeviticus 24:10-16\nOne day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father got into a \nfight with one of the Israelite men. During the fight, this son of an \nIsraelite woman blasphemed the LORD\u2019s name. So the man was brought to Moses \nfor judgment. His mother\u2019s name was Shelomith. She was the daughter of \nDibri of the tribe of Dan. They put the man in custody until the LORD\u2019s \nwill in the matter should become clear. Then the LORD said to Moses, \u201cTake \nthe blasphemer outside the camp, and tell all those who heard him to lay \ntheir hands on his head. Then let the entire community stone him to death. \nSay to the people of Israel: Those who blaspheme God will suffer the \nconsequences of their guilt and be punished. Anyone who blasphemes the \nLORD\u2019s name must be stoned to death by the whole community of Israel. Any \nIsraelite or foreigner among you who blasphemes the LORD\u2019s name will surely \ndie. \n\nRomans 1:24-32\nSo God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts \ndesired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other\u2019s \nbodies. Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they \ndeliberately chose to believe lies. So they worshiped the things God made \nbut not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever. Amen. That is \nwhy God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned \nagainst the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each \nother. And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with \nwomen, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other \nmen and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly \ndeserved. When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their \nevil minds and let them do things that should never be done. Their lives \nbecame full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, \nfighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. They are backstabbers, \nhaters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They are forever inventing \nnew ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents. They refuse to \nunderstand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving. They \nare fully aware of God\u2019s death penalty for those who do these things, yet \nthey go right ahead and do them anyway. And, worse yet, they encourage \nothers to do them, too. \n\nIsaiah 14:21\nMake ready to slaughter his sons for the guilt of their fathers; Lest they \nrise and posses the earth, and fill the breadth of the world with tyrants. \n\nIsaiah 13:15-18\nAnyone who is captured will be run through with a sword. Their little \nchildren will be dashed to death right before their eyes. Their homes will \nbe sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes. For I will stir up \nthe Medes against Babylon, and no amount of silver or gold will buy them \noff. The attacking armies will shoot down the young people with arrows. \nThey will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for \nthe children.\n\nNumbers 25:1-9\nWhile the Israelites were camped at Acacia, some of the men defiled \nthemselves by sleeping with the local Moabite women. These women invited \nthem to attend sacrifices to their gods, and soon the Israelites were \nfeasting with them and worshiping the gods of Moab. Before long Israel was \njoining in the worship of Baal of Peor, causing the LORD\u2019s anger to blaze \nagainst his people. The LORD issued the following command to Moses: \u201cSeize \nall the ringleaders and execute them before the LORD in broad daylight, so \nhis fierce anger will turn away from the people of Israel.\u201d So Moses \nordered Israel\u2019s judges to execute everyone who had joined in worshiping \nBaal of Peor. Just then one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman \ninto the camp, right before the eyes of Moses and all the people, as they \nwere weeping at the entrance of the Tabernacle. When Phinehas son of \nEleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest saw this, he jumped up and left \nthe assembly. Then he took a spear and rushed after the man into his tent. \nPhinehas thrust the spear all the way through the man\u2019s body and into the \nwoman\u2019s stomach. So the plague against the Israelites was stopped, but not \nbefore 24,000 people had died.\n\n\n... would you like more?

You would also be able to tell if \nsaid person is on the run from a fanatical regime because of \nliberal/secular beliefs.\nHow about Malala Yousafzai?

In short you \ncan't guarantee anything when it comes to security. If that's what you're \nafter then you'll never have it and you'll live in paranoia forever more.\nOf course if you want to restrict migrations from certain regions because \nof religious they are... Okay, how about you start with the most radical of \nall Middle-Eastern nations, Saudi-Arabia, which is responsible for \nspreading Wahhabism. Once the US cuts its ties with that nation then you'll \nhave a non hypocritical leg to stand on.\nHow to solve terrorism... Hmm... How you, the US, stop supporting those \nwhom spread radical Islam. Arm Syrian rebels aka. ISIS and Al-Nusra. Stop \ntoppling democratically elected leaders e.g. Iran '53.\nStop invading nations and creating chaos which acts as perfect breeding \nground for radicalism.\nIf you think that the US has issues with integration then you're clearly \nmistaken. The US does a rather impressive job when it comes to producing \nsecular muslims. The EU on the other hand doesn't as it won't take \nresponsibility for the people it has foolishly allowed to stream in. If you \nallow people from highly religious regions into your country then you have \nto make sure they understand that they have to leave incompatible parts of \ntheir culture behind and adapt to their new home instead of simply throwing \nthem into ghetto areas and allowing radical imams to roam free.\nIn short you can take your regressive ad hominem and stick it right up as \nit is nothing but a pathetic attempt to weasel out of supporting Trump \nbecause you have an irrational fear of muslims in general and want to \nrationalise your support of his ideas via projection.\n\nAgain, how do you rationalise banning every single muslim in the world from \nmoving to the US. It's clearly not because they're radical as the Saudis \nare the most radical sunnis in the world and they're allowed in.\nIt's not because they hold highly religious views as that's par for the \ncourse in the conservative parts of the US. Heck, it's sometimes hard to \ntell the difference between them and Islamists.\nIt's not because they're violent as there are plenty of mass shootings to \ngo around originating from all walks of life and not just muslims.\nIt's not because they're not secular as you have Christians that only think \nthe constitution applies when it's useful to them and literally don't want \na separation of church and state.\nIt's not because homosexuals are generally despised in Islamic nations, as \nthere are parts of the us where they are also despised. Heck there are \nconservatives out there actively trying to remove their rights.\nSo give me an argument that isn't dripping with hypocrisy as you why every \nsingle muslim in the world should be barred from moving to the US...

Insulting and attacking Islam and bombing \nit's followers will not work to defang the religion in the long term, only \nmake it worse."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQewyCk8Kz7LKOT9XXLjRNQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Pete Gabrys", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mf3oablmcwnhzb04cgh1rcrftvrkxvxs0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T23:20:17.986Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQewyCk8Kz7LKOT9XXLjRNQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9426656, "formal_score": 15, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T23:20:17.986Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rmyflYxCi28/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEA/e_sVjBpObYU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106272044897680533740", "textDisplay": "+samiamrg7 Religion is the problem and Islam is the worst of ALL religions! \nso deal with it cause i think people are getting quite sick of Muslims and \ntheir garbage!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrk71WEyqg0UzA2g8hXt11w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "samiamrg7", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mf3oablmcwnhzb04cgh1rcrftvrkxvxs0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2016-05-06T04:41:38.244Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrk71WEyqg0UzA2g8hXt11w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8556499, "formal_score": 95, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2016-05-06T04:41:38.244Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MHHm5EQT4Y8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADA/6qgKri39kA0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104647994541383213273", "textDisplay": "Islam isn't the problem, Salafi Jihadism is.

Versus the Christians who were \nabolitionists.\n\n2. Location, socioeconomics, and education are more important than \nreligion. So you can have a modern, educated, and rich country like the US \nrely more on democracy and openess. Whereas you can have the poorer and \nless educated countries in Africa rely more on superstition and fear.\n\nI brought up Iran as an extreme example, but you must know that life in \nIran was very different before the revolution in 1979 and the CIA's \nmeddling in Iran's politics.... http://all-that-is-interesting.com/shah-iran\n\nBut obviously I could have brought up many other countries like Tunisia, \nTurkey, Indonesia, Morroco, Bahrain, Qatar, etc. There are many other \npredominantly Muslim countries in the world besides the ones that you hear \nabout in the news every day that are in constant conflict.\n\nYeah all christian majority countries don't all have draconian laws because \nthey are mostly all rich stable countries... duh...\n\nWhen Ireland was in constant conflict you had extreme christian groups. \nSo.... why would it be surprising to see extremist coming out of the \ncountries in the middle-east that have been in constant war and conflict \n(Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, etc.)? \n\nIn the US after the civil war we had the KKK which was a christian group \nwho killed thousands of blacks and jews.
