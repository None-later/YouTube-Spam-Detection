Must be hard for you. That is correct that she's still convicted \nfor that \"lie\". But there is still plenty of good reasons for not to blame \nAmanda for her mental breakdown during the relentless and cunningly \nexecuted interrogation, due to the psychological stress and manipulation \nthat she was exposed to. It is quite obvious that the result of this lead \nto a commonly known phenomenon during such circumstances which is called \n\"brain overload\", and; that she was responding to the interrogators \nrelentless pressure and their repeated request for her to \"start \nimaginationing\" then becomes quite understandable. Just a few hours later \nwhen she had got time to reflect and get her thoughts together she wrote a \nletter to the prosecution explaining that she was confused - out of mental \nbalance and control, and that she could not stand for or even believe what \nshe had said. However; this letter was not taken under account by the \nprosecution because now they had squeezed her for what they so much wanted, \nand now they had got it: a prime suspect. Thus they continued to keep \nLumumba under arrest until Rudy Guede was arrested a couple of weeks later, \nand they had no other choice than to admit that they had been all wrong.\nA rational conclusion should be that the blame for those so called \"lies\" \nmust be directed towards the prosecution which were the ones who carried \nout the improper and illegal interrogation, and not against Amanda Knox - a \nyoung naive and relatively defenceless woman in a foreign country, \ninterrogated without a lawyer and a proper interpreter. However, when that \nis said, I think there is some more coherence in that verdict than in the \nutterly absurd murder accusation and the previous guilty verdict. Anyway; \nit is a trifle compared to being accused and convicted for murder, and \nafter all inequities Amanda has been put through by the Italian juridical \nsystem I don't think they will get any way with it, especially now when \nshe's acquitted for the murder charge. I don't know, but maybe it is time \nfor Amanda to let her American lawyers consider suing the Italian juridical \nsystem.

So, to answer your \nquestion - Yes, I am happy if she is free now even if she were guilty \n(which i simply don't believe she is).  She is one of our own and I am \nhappy she is home now, back among her own people, where she belongs.   :)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XuHXBzKvfMcnmv_KWsK9w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Maria Birchwood", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ksxgz3wb0g13jk04chlcrxwn2ivrqzyw0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-16T09:59:24.082Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7XuHXBzKvfMcnmv_KWsK9w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.23912599999999995, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-16T09:59:24.082Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105455791657065140104", "textDisplay": "+Nick Bauer The judge said on page 49 that Knox presence at the crime scene \nwas CERTAIN and that Rudy DIDN'T ACT ALONE and he was in fact accused of \nbeing AN ACCOMPLICE to murder NOT the only murderer.

He was one of the leading character assassins against Amanda, \nhe is the one who first published \"Foxy Knoxy\". He later admitted on TV \nthat there is not enough evidence against Amanda or Rafaelle to bring them \nto trial in England. He believed Mignini's lies originally, like millions \nof others, but once the truth came out, he admitted it and moved forward.\n\nThe Italian police have a record showing they interrogated Amanda and \nRafaelle for 50 hours, BEFORE arresting them and interrogating them even \nmore. There is no denying this.\n\nNo. The police got her phone records and saw she texted Patrick the night \nof the murder. Here text was the Italian translation of \"See you later\", \nhowever, she meant it like the English \"See you later\" which is vague and \ncould mean see you in hours, days, weeks, or months. In Italian, \"See you \nlater\" literally means see you later that day. So the police, not \nunderstanding the English nuance, assumed not only Amanda and Rafaelle did \nit, but also Patrick.\n\nThey lied to Amanda and convinced her that her brain had changed her memory \nbecause she couldn't stand the scene of the crime.

Only Rudy, Amanda \nand Raffaele know what happened and they are all unreliable witnesses \nconstantly changing their stories and lying even when not under duress. \nHere's what I think happened on that night - it was a prank that spiralled \ntragically out of control. Although initially friends, there was a lot of \nfriction and conflict which had developed between Meredith and Amanda. On \nthe fateful night, Amanda decides to teach her flatmate a lesson by scaring \nand humiliating her. She and Raphael go to the cottage with Rudy with the \nintention of 'punking' Meredith who is alone in the cottage. Although \nAmanda denied knowing Rudy, she later admitted she did know him  (in fact \nRudy probably supplied them with drugs). The intention is that Rudy and \nRaphael, possibly wearing masks, pretend to be intruders in order to give \nMeredith a fright. and enter her room and threaten her with a knife or \nknives. (Raffaele allegedly was a knife fetishist and Rudy often carried \none during his robberies). Amanda, who has orchestrated all this, is \nlistening from outside the room or elsewhere in the cottage. Things get out \nof hand and Rudy loses control and stabs Meredith fatally. Panic ensues and \nRudy leaves shortly afterwards to go to a disco hoping it will provide an \nalibi. Amanda and Raphael stage a very unconvincingly burglary by \nransacking one of the other rooms and breaking a window. They clean up the \ncottage that night or possibly early the following morning. Luminol will \nlater reveal three sets of bloody footprints which correspond to Rudy, \nAmanda and Raphael. They lock Merediths' door, concoct a story about being \nat Raphael's flat all night and sleeping until 10.30am and hope they have \ngotten away with it. So in conclusion, I don't think Amanda is quite the \ncold blooded killer some portray her as - but she is certainly a liar and I \nbelieve she set in motion events which spiralled out of control. Amanda \nand Raffaele have been lying about their involvement ever since. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqj_PcEdkXOJ05lGje6yu1Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "nogoodwolf", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12uczfjzuuagbt2n23rffm5isvcxla1g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-02T02:38:59.172Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqj_PcEdkXOJ05lGje6yu1Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.70734000000000008, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-07-02T02:38:59.172Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112521234043247472362", "textDisplay": "You forgot the part about the excrement in the toilet.

This tactic was \nparticularly effective since jurors in Italy are not sequestered or \nforbidden from reading and discussing the case while the trial is ongoing. \nIt is a common tactic in Italy, although it is strictly forbidden by the \nItalian law of segreto istruttorio.\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/04/knox-acquittal-only-possible-verdict"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqugWyqJxCLEjaV0_BkWPWQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Scott Currier", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12hglroaoa0fvqyu04chjyprtfnjpli2ec", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-11T14:31:27.818Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqugWyqJxCLEjaV0_BkWPWQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.91026169999999995, "formal_score": 42, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-11T14:31:27.818Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107810654693564729309", "textDisplay": "Ok, thank you for the clarification.

The \nburden of proof is on the person who asserts contamination, not the person \nwho denies it. In other words, if the defence lawyers claim the DNA \nevidence was contaminated, they must describe the specific place and time \nwhere it could have plausibly occurred. Nobody has ever proved that the bra \nclasp and knife evidence were contaminated.\n\nDr Stefanoni analysed the traces on the knife six days after last handling \nMeredith\u2019s DNA. This mean laboratory contamination can be ruled out. \n\n\u201cLaboratory contamination was also excluded by these experts [Conti and \nVecchiotti].\u201d (The Supreme Court report, page 92).\n\nJudge Micheli ruled out contamination during the collection phase because \nthe knife was sequestered from Sollecito\u2019s apartment on Corso Garibaldi by \na different police team to the one that collected evidence from the cottage \non Via della Pergola on the same day.\n\nMeredith had never been to Sollecito\u2019s apartment, so contamination away \nfrom the laboratory was impossible.\n\nProfessor Torricelli testified at the Massei trial that it was unlikely the \nclasp was contaminated because there was a significant amount of \nSollecito's DNA on it. \n\nAlberto Intini, the head of the Italian police forensic science unit, \nexcluded environmental contamination at the Massei trial because \u201cDNA \ndoesn\u2019t fly.\u201d\n\nProfessor Novelli also ruled out environmental contamination:\n\n\u201cThe hook contaminated by dust? It\u2019s more likely for a meteorite to fall \nand bring this court down to the ground.\u201d\n\nDavid Balding, a Professor of Statistical Genetics at University College \nLondon, analysed the DNA evidence against Sollecito and concluded it was \nstrong: \n\n\"But because Sollecito is fully represented in the stain at 15 loci (we \nstill only use 10 in the UK, so 15 is a lot), the evidence against him is \nstrong.\"\n\nCrime scenes are not clean, sterilised environments like laboratories. If a \nforensic technician picks up a dusty object off the floor, they will get \ndust on their gloves. It's irrelevant anyway because it's impossible to get \na full DNA profile from dust. In other words, Solicitors DNA couldn't have \ncome from the small amount of dust on the glove. He claimed that he had \nnever been in Meredith's room. What was the source of Sollecito's DNA? The \nSupreme Court pointed out that Sollecito\u2019s DNA was never found alone at the \ncottage. The only trace of his DNA was mixed with Knox\u2019s DNA on the \ncigarette butt in the kitchen. This means the mixed DNA sample could not \nhave been the source of the DNA on the clasp because Knox\u2019s DNA would also \nhave been found on it. It's impossible that a forensic technician \ncontaminated the bra clasp because tertiary transfer of touch DNA has never \nbeen demonstrated in a reliable, peer-reviewed scientific study.\n\nThe case against Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito has never hinged on the \nDNA evidence. \n\nFour witnesses, including two police officers, said there were shards of \nglass on top of the clothes on Filomena's floor. This proves the window was \nbroken after the room had been ransacked and that the break-in was staged. \nIt couldn't have been Rudy Guede because his bloody footprints led straight \nout of Meredith's room and out of the cottage. There was not one \nfingerprint, palm print, footprint, shoeprint, hair follicle, speck of DNA \netc belonging to Guede in this room. Who staged the break-in? Here's a \nclue: Amanda Knox's DNA was found mixed with Meredith's blood on the floor \nof Filomena's room.\n\nThe bloody footprint on the blue bathmat in the bathroom matched the \nprecise characteristics of Sollecito\u2019s foot, but couldn\u2019t possibly belong \nto Guede. Knox's and Sollecito's bare bloody footprints were revealed by \nLuminol in the hallway.\n\nThe computer and telephone records provide irrefutable proof that Knox and \nSollecito lied repeatedly to the police. They gave completely different \naccounts of where they were, who they were with and what they were doing on \nthe night of the murder. Neither Knox nor Sollecito have credible alibis \ndespite three attempts each. All the other people who were questioned had \none credible alibi that could be verified. Innocent people don't give \nmultiple conflicting alibis and lie repeatedly to the police.\n\nAfter Amanda Knox was informed that Sollecito was no longer providing her \nwith an alibi, she repeatedly admitted that she was at the cottage when \nMeredith was killed. At the trial, Sollecito refused to corroborate Knox's \nalibi that she was at his apartment.\n\nJudge Nencini pointed out in his report that Knox made statements to the \npolice that contained specific references to events that the investigation \nascertained actually happened on 1 and 2 November 2007 and that nobody \nother than a participant in those tragic events could have known about. She \nknew that Meredith had been sexually assaulted and had screamed loudly and \nshe placed herself near the basketball ball in Piazza Grimana which was \ncorroborated by another witness. \n\nKnox accused an innocent man, Diya Lumumba, of murdering Meredith despite \nthe fact she knew he was completely innocent. She didn't recant her false \nand malicious allegation against Lumumba the whole time he was in prison. \nShe acknowledged that it was her fault that Lumumba was in prison in an \nintercepted conversation with her mother on 10 November 2007.\n\nIf anybody wants to understand the reasons why Amanda Knox was convicted of \nmurder, I recommend reading the translations of the official court \ndocuments and court testimony.

Knox had never met nor seen Guede before \nGuede appeared in her trial as a witness to lie about her involvement in \nhis crime. No, again, the police accused THREE INNOCENT people of a crime \nthey did not commit.\n\nWhat are you talking about, the key didn't work? Does the prosecution just \nmake this stuff up as they go?? This is exactly why we have the Double \nJeapordy law in America. Guede broke through the window exactly the same \nway he had broken through every other window of every other apartment he \nhad robbed in that neighborhood. And every time he carried a knife with him \nand EVERY TIME he went alone. Again, please stop and ask yourself these \nsimple questions....like, why would they bother to stage a break-in whose \nmethod pointed directly at Guede? Why would they clean up Rafaelle and \nAmanda's DNA but leave Guede\"s DNA if all three did the crime together?\n\nBtw, the police admitted they only checked a couple of surfaces for DNA in \nthe roommates room, which does not prove that Guede's DNA was there or was \nnot there. Moreover, they found fragments of the glass from that broken \nwindow UNDER Meredith's torn-off and blood-stained clothing in her room.\n\nAgain, $300 was stolen! That was Meredith's rent money which she was set to \npay to the landlord, in cash, just like all the other girls. That's why the \ndrug-addict Guede chose their apartment on the day he chose it. The norm in \nItaly is to pay rent in cash on the same day every month. Guede knew from \nvisiting the guys downstairs that four girls lived upstairs and each one \npaid $300 every month in cash. He also had plenty of opportunity to figure \nout which room or windows would be the easiest to break in to. Oddly \nenough, after raping and brutally murdering Meredith, he didn't stick \naround long enough to see how many computers or other difficult to carry \nitems he could find...he just took Meredith's cash and left. In fact, like \na guilty person would do, he fled the country. What did Amanda do, despite \nhaving opportunities to flee or escape if she was actually guilty? She \nstayed in Italy to try to help the police find the rapist who murdered her \nroommate.\n\nAgain, if you really believe that Amanda had done a \"prank\" like that, then \nit's no wonder you cannot see through all the mountain of fallacies \ninvolved in the prosecution's theory."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XuHXBzKvfMcnmv_KWsK9w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Maria Birchwood", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12uxdyaavqlwfb3c23oshjzdvemidrde", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-21T18:04:30.130Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7XuHXBzKvfMcnmv_KWsK9w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.476796, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-21T18:07:18.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105455791657065140104", "textDisplay": "Guedes was friends with the boys who lived downstairs, Knox knew Guedes and \nshe LIED to protect him but instead, she accused an unconnected INNOCENT \nman of the murder.\n\n Guedes knew full well that the latch of the front door didn't work, this \nmeans he could get access through the front door.\n\n NOTHING was stolen so it was NOT a burglary and no Guedes DNA was found in \nthis room where the \"burglary\" was staged, this was Filomena's room, so he \nwas found NOT guilty of burglary but he was charged for participating in \nthe murder of Meredith Kercher.\n\nThe \"burglary\" was staged as Knox is known to have done this \nsame \"prank\" before to her room mates as a sick  \"joke\" and the experienced \ninvestigators could see that the glass was OVER the items rather than \nunderneath them which means the articles were disturbed FIRST and the glass \nwas broken AFTER.

DNA is not the epicentre of a murder investigation owing to \nthe fact it only enables us to know who was where, who came into heavy \ncontact with what etcetera. It cannot tell us what happened with any \ncredible detail. It cannot re create a crime on it's own. It cannot \ndetermine a motive. It cannot tell us about the behaviour and state of mind \nof a suspect. It cannot even begin to help to explain complex interpersonal \nadolescent relationships, unless we only ever use 'semen' as our centre \npoint. Something that ticks me off about the US stance on all of this is \nthat by focusing strictly on DNA they have turned a blind eye to the wealth \nof all the other physical and testimonial evidence. I don't know how they \ndo things in the US but in Europe, particularly France and Italy, they \nstill use their instinct. Instinct is a detectives greatest asset. And DNA \nis useful in proving that the suspect was at the scene of the crime. That \nthe suspect came into contact with the murder weapon. That the suspect came \ninto contact with the victim. Lets look at the three primary suspects: \n1)Guede - contact with victim? Check. At the scene? Check. Contact with \nweapon? Check. 2)Knox - contact with victim? Neg. At the scene? Check. \nContact with weapon? Check. 3)Sollecitto - Check Check Check. So where does \nthat leave us? cherry picking one from three possibilities and discounting \ntwo? or does it mean we can determine that the three suspects were present \nwhen the crime was committed; therefore, utilizing the other physical and \ntestimonial evidence we can determine that yes, all three are guilty. It is \nworthy to note that the evidence is rather compelling and in the US would \nbe enough to deny an appeal. FOA forget how lucky Amanda was to have \nmurdered someone in Italy and not back home in Seattle where the state \nstill uses the death penalty.

He had no \nalibi (unlike Rafaele and Amanda, as their phone calls and nightly \nactivities showed). Moreover, all of the DNA (and nobody else's DNA) at the \ncrime scene came from Guede, including the DNA in her body and underneath \nher.\n\nIt is physically impossible for three people to commit such a violent crime \nand for two of them (with no equipment and no training) to somehow find \ntheir own DNA and only clean up their own DNA while leaving their \naccomplice's DNA. On top of that, why on God's earth would such criminal \n\"geniuses\" go to the incredible trouble of leaving the DNA of their \naccomplice even if it were possible to clean up two out of three people's \nDNA? It's ludicrous, on top of being impossible.\n\nGuede was the only one who raped and murdered Meredith, and he was the only \none with a criminal history. He also was the only one who used that exact \nbreak-in method before, and who was known to carry a knife.\n\nAmanda didn't blame an innocent person, that was the police. They found a \ntext to the bar owner from Amanda that evening that said, 'See you later', \nin Italian. Amanda was using the American/English meaning of, \"see you \nsometime in the near future\", whereas the police suspected she meant the \nItalian meaning of, \"see you later today/tonight\". That's why the police \nblamed the innocent guy and using 50 hours of interrogation may have (!) \nconvinced her that her own memory was wrong.\n\nThink about it for a minute. Why would Amanda try to cover up for Guede, \nafter Amanda and Rafaele worked so hard to leave Guede's DNA at the crime \nscene (even though they cleaned up their own -- if you believe that fantasy \nto begin with)? It doesn't make sense because it's not true.\n\nMoreover, that whole \"confession\" would have been thrown out in America or \nBritain because Amanda was denied her right to an attorney and the \npolice/prosecutors ILLEGALLY turned off the recording of the whole 50 hours \nplus of interrogation. That's Italian law.\n\nMoreover, the Mignini trial established what the Italians call judicial \nprecedent, which is basically, that if a 'truth' is found in one case, any \ncase related to that first case's 'truth' must accept that truth in its \nruling. Therefore, when Mignini fast tracked Guede for trial and gave him \nthe 16 year-off deal, Amanda and Rafaele were not allowed to defend \nthemselves. Their lawyers were not even allowed to enter any evidence or \narguments. Guede admitted guilt and lied about Amanda and Rafaelle helping \nhim (he told the truth to his friends on Skype while a fugitive in Germany, \nhe told five Italian convicts in jail the truth, and he told Mignini the \ntruth until Mignini offered the deal of a lifetime).\n\nMoreover, the illegal interrogation was ruled inadmissible in the criminal \ntrial, but Mignini arranged it so that the civil and criminal trials were \nconducted at the same time, the two juries were in the same room and the \ncriminal jury not only heard of all the illegal interrogation and coerced \n'confession', but they also were never sequestered. So the heard and read \nall of the biased Italian media, the mingled with the other jury, and they \nwere frequently seen having lunch with the prosecution team during the year \nlong trial.\n\nOn top of all of that, Guede stole Meredith's rent money which he needed \nfor his drug habit. He had done the same thing numerous times before, and \nevery time he carried a knife and he went solo.\n\nIf you actually believe that Amanda and Rafaele were accomplices, this \ncrime would be unprecedented in the history of mankind. Rafaele and Amanda \nhad only met one week before, and neither had ever met Guede before. Yet, \nhere they were raping and murdering Amanda's roommate despite the fact that \nAmanda was in Heaven, living in Italy and had just met a handsome Italian \nboyfriend. Not exactly the setting for hate or violence. Plus, these two, \nwithout any equipment or training, would have to have been able to complete \na task that no experienced CSI team with unlimited equipment could dream of \ndoing; remove their DNA while leaving someone else's. Plus, Guede \nimmediately fled after the murder while Amanda and Rafaele stayed and tried \nto help the police. Amanda's parents tried very hard to get her to fly home \nimmediately but she insisted on staying to help the police. The guilty \nflee. Even crazier, you would have to believe that these two new lovers, \nwould not only be rapists and murderers after having fallen in love just \none week prior, but that they basically agreed to be cannibals too since \nthe prosecution insisted that they took the murder weapon, the knife, home \nfrom the murder and used it/ were going to use it to prepare their meals. \nGuede threw away his knife after the murder, but they brought their knife \nhome?

I don't share your optimism about the \nItalian court system. I think they're in too deep and need to save face. I \nthink that they will convict her and if they do, most likely they are \nsending an innocent person to jail. Someone brought up the sociopath theory \nand I am in the middle of thinking that one through. I appreciate her input \nbut I don't think that I am going to be convinced of that theory. However, \nI'm keeping it in mind. The question is whether or not the Italians can \nconvince the US Secretary of State that it is proper to extradite Knox. \nIt's possible that Kerry will not find their case convincing and will turn \ndown the request on those grounds. It's also possible that the reason for \nKnox all of a sudden getting engaged is to throw pregnancy into the issue \nwhich from what I have read will affect extradition in her favor. I don't \nhave the details. In another message I posted a link to the extradition \nprocess and it looks to be anything except straightforward.  I think that \nthe best possible likely outcome is that the Italians will say \"guilty\" but \neither not press for extradition or possible have the extradition turned \ndown on grounds that a compelling case doesn't exist. If that happens, \nshe'll never be able to go to Italy again or even the EU and will have to \nbe very careful when traveling abroad. But, the US is a darn big country so \nit's easy to live an entire life without leaving the country. It's 5000 \nmiles from here to Hawaii. I could have gone to Moscow or just about \nanywhere in Europe and would have been closer to home. My trip to the 50th \nstate was equivalent to traveling to the other side of the world, one way. \nWe have Islands in the Pacific, the lower 48 states, Alaska, territories in \nthe Caribbean, you can travel a long way and still be on US territory. Guam \nis about 9000 miles from me. Local call on the phone because it's a US \nterritory.

In their public statements they do not \ncall her anything worse than \"the accused.\" I'll have to re-read Kercher's \nfather's book. I bought it to hear their family's side of the story. I \nskimmed it the other day because someone had suggested that he was trashing \nKnox. I didn't see it in the book. What the family did say when Knox was \nacquitted was that the family was back to square one and didn't know what \nto believe. I think that most of the Anti-Knox people are probably more \ncertain of Knox's guilt than the Kercher's are. At any rate, being \npro-Kercher does not mean that you think Knox is guilty. It is possible to \nbelieve that Knox is innocent and that the Kerchers are good people. My \ninstinct tells me that she is not guilty.

Maybe they are when their Dad is not waiting for them, but they \nstill can't be smelling that great while they are doing it. \nThe guilters are right the American media has not told enough of the story \n-- if they had, it would not have been possible to have the latest trial, \nthe laughter from across the Atlantic would be too loud."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmDRIlfmnn_lFw_HL01PaqA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "corpus vile", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nxrmbqyjqjthfi22ox3zqhm25jpert04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-19T21:05:07.485Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmDRIlfmnn_lFw_HL01PaqA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.62407799999999991, "formal_score": 7, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-19T21:06:51.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EUSCL9Suyfk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/PltkKcVjPuM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115878520697539207443", "textDisplay": "+ho2cultcha\nI didn't say they were now, but they will be once the court of Cassation \nfinalizes their conviction.

Mignini indicted 20 people and \ncharged them with the concealment of Narducci's murder. The charges were \neventually dismissed.[20] Narducci's family and colleagues believe that his \ndeath was a suicide.[18]\n\nIn April 2006, Mignini had Italian journalist Mario Spezi arrested for \ncomplicity in the homicides of the Monster of Florence case and interfering \nwith an investigation. Spezi was held for 23 days, 5 without a lawyer.[21]\n\nOn 22 March 2013, the Third Circuit Court of Cassation (Supreme Court of \nItaly) ruled that the main case related to criminal conduct \"did not \nexist\", and that Francesco Narducci died by suicide.[22] In sustaining the \nlower court acquittals, the Court of Cassation also sent back for re-trial \nsome of the parallel slander charges.\n\nAllegations of abuse of office:\n\nIn 2006, Mignini was charged with abuse of office for allegedly ordering \nthe illegal wiretapping of the phones of various police officers and \njournalists involved in the Monster of Florence case.[21] In January 2010, \na Florence court found him guilty of exceeding the powers of his office but \nacquitted of the remaining charges.[6] He was given a 16-month suspended \nsentence. Mignini appealed the conviction, saying \"My conscience is clear, \nI know I did nothing wrong.\" [23] He remained in office through the appeal \nprocess, as Italian law does not consider convictions final until all \nappeals are exhausted.[24][25] In November 2011, the Court of Appeal in \nFlorence overturned Mignini's conviction for LACK OF JURISDICTION [a \ntechnicality] and referred the case to the prosecutor in Turin to decide \nwhether to re-file the charges.[26] According to Rome-based journalist and \nauthor Barbie Latza Nadeau, even if Mignini were convicted, offenses such \nas this are rarely grounds for removing a prosecutor from office.[IN \nITALY][27]\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Mignini#Notable_cases"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl":

They were just young kids experimenting with life away \nfrom home. You might judge girls who experiment with sex as 'promiscuous', \nbut if you're going to judge Amanda, then you have to put Meredith in the \nSAME basket. But what does any of this have to do with murder? There is no \ncorrelation between a person's sex life and murder. If Amanda was a 'slut', \nthen so was Meredith. I don't think of either of them as 'sluts', and I am \nsure that you are a LONG way from the image of your own AVATAR, which says \na lot about how you WANT to be perceived, and NOTHING about who you really \nare. I suspect that you are actually extremely unattractive!!"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe8Fs2HEcP1ZNsfkU8aEf5A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Eloise Sinclair", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12czzz5tpbds1fg004cidci5ynbz1mpk5w", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-07T14:44:18.351Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCe8Fs2HEcP1ZNsfkU8aEf5A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.6434439999999999, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-07T14:44:18.351Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117897568018210654796", "textDisplay": "+luzern1982 None of your comments make any sense.
