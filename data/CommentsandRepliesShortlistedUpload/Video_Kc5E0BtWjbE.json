Most soldiers who survived \ncombat will be scarred for life even if they won't show or admit it but \npeople seem to be more concerned with that \"creepy\" kid who doesn't seem to \nmake friends, doesn't go to church, doesn't like Justin Bieber and reads \nsome controversial stuff like Hitler's Mein Kampf. This in my opinion is a \nsign of a messed up society when a kid with good musical  taste, an \ninterest in history and smart enough not to believe in an invisible friend \nis feared. No wonder that such a person is a lonely outcast because he is \nsurrounded by sheep. This society is very likely to produce unstable \nindividuals, the movie \"God bless America\" is an interesting take on such a \ntransformation.\n\nThe civilian population has this insatiable appetite for \"pretend\" and \n\"lite\" gore which is reflected in the murder news and pretty much half of \nthe documentaries on Discovery or the movies of Hollywood. The people have \nno clue what violence or death looks like because it is dumbed down to a \nconsumer product for them to enjoy. This is an extremely detrimental \nconditioning that we have and it does not guarantee the safety of any group \nbut it helps create conflict between groups thus propagating the violence. \nIt creates this herd mentality and people will blindly follow their leaders \nnever questioning their intentions.\n\nIt's in our nature to protect children and women, it's just an ancient \nanimal instinct but this makes us look subjectively at victims. The \nsoldiers (mostly men) who are sent to die thus become just a commodity, \ntheir loss becomes more an inconvenience than a tragedy when they are every \nbit as valuable human beings as the rest of us who they think they are \nprotecting.\n\nAnyway, school shootings are a very disturbing phenomenon but they seem to \nbe out of control in the USA. The wikipedia entry on \"school shooting\" will \ngive you lots of data and you will see that while that page holds all the \nshootings for the world, USA has a separate much larger article and list. I \njust looked at Europe as a whole which has more than twice of USA's \npopulation but the number of shootings doesn't even come close. There \nclearly is something different there. I think we can safely presume that \nthe general population is equally stupid, violent, racist etc. around the \nglobe or there is little variation form place to place. The first big \ndifference between the US and EU is that we have no guns! Guns do NOT \nbelong in civilian hands and in my opinion not even in the hands of most \nlaw enforcement or army personnel. Some European countries don't even arm \ntheir police officers. Other differences I see are for example less \nreligious and way less patriotic people. Religious zealousness + over the \ntop patriotism + a shitload of guns can't result in anything good and we \ncan clearly see this in both the USA and the Middle East. Both places \npretty much correspond to that description and both places seem to be \nabundant with domestic civilian violence as well as the place or source for \nmost recent or ongoing wars. In my view this is a turf war between two \nequally badly conditioned tribes of chimps because civilized human beings \nwould not endorse these horrific acts of violence."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2o6v_ANfJTcS91SVBgAGrw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "loverainthunder", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z130dtnxqzz4vvn1x231z5gyute2hn0zv04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-17T15:01:57.255Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC2o6v_ANfJTcS91SVBgAGrw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.23585400000000001, "formal_score": 15, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-17T15:01:57.255Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1rQGIMoXl-k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB4/hQXVtJE-290/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101453006494281420870", "textDisplay": "+Botond Kis Kovacs Very interesting idea that people will direct their \ncreative or destructive energies into a game instead of pursuing it in real \nlife.\n\nI too was surprised that they found his statements about chimps and \nconditioning shocking.

I can't \nstand the idea of any one especially children being killed in war, but \nthose actions are considered \"casualties\", yet a comment that we would be \nchimps if not for our conditioning is somehow a disturbing sentiment. \n\nI think we are conditioned by our social groups to ignore certain horrible \nelements of violence, (minorities being executed, imprisoned, drone bombing \nchildren etc) because our group tells us it represents safety of our \npersonal group.

I tend to agree that civilization is sustained by \nconditioning children to behave in a certain way, living proof are the \ndifferent customs in different countries which sometimes totally clash with \neach other. We are taught how to behave otherwise we wouldn't be any \ndifferent than chimps. Just look at disaster situations when the first \nthing to happen is looting and when things escalate people start to use any \nmeans necessary to survive and civilization turns into chaos and anarchy.\n\nAnyway it's easy to nitpick after he proved to be a psychopath and \"find \nclues\" in everything he ever said. This particular interview in my opinion \nis as normal as it gets at least for people who have an at least marginally \ncritical or philosophic thinking.\n\nAs for people taking interest in acts of violence... isn't that 90% of the \nnews in any country of the world? I stopped watching news because all you \ncan see is rape, murder, accidents more rape and more murder and yeah maybe \nthey sometimes mention in passing some uninteresting things like a rover \nlanding on Mars or some huge scientific breakthrough. Even this very video \nwe are commenting on is \"taking interest in violence\" but that doesn't mean \nthat the hosts of the show are psychos nor does it mean that the audience \nis.\n\nSome of the things he posted are indeed disturbing, like praising other \nshooters, that is clearly the sign of something dark going on in his mind \nbut this particular \"interview\" is nothing that would warrant that muffled \n\"Jesus!\" from Ben when Ana finished reading the quote. If the TYT hosts \nconsider this deranged thinking instead of a valid philosophical point it \nmeans I have just lost a fair bit of respect for them.\n\nAnother interesting point is games based on acts of violence. Well I don't \nreally have numbers at my disposal but I am fairly certain that a \nsignificant market share belongs to games based on actual wars that have \nbeen fought and another significant share belongs to games based on fantasy \nconflicts or there are even games based on random violence like the Postal \nseries. Is basing a game on a war that had over a dozen million casualties \n(most of them civilians) more ethical than basing a game on a shooting that \nhad a dozen casualties? Does war make innocents' deaths any more \njustifiable or acceptable? Any death is tragic, especially if we are \ntalking about children but why isn't there outrage because of the Arab \nchildren killed by American soldiers and drones/bombs in any of the middle \neastern conflicts? How about ethnic cleansing like let's say the killing of \nNative Americans, Armenians, Jews or Tutsis?\n\nGames are games, those have nothing to do with reality, a sadistic genocide \ngame is no more dangerous than a rock erosion simulator unless it gets in \nthe hands of a susceptible idiot (imagine someone having a rock erosion \nfetish and masturbating on roadside smooth surfaced rocks). Games are most \noften a tool to blow off steam and a way for everyone to live out that \nbottled up anger and violence that you can not do in real life because you \nare \"civilized\". Same is true for racing games or city building games, you \nlive out things that you are not able to do in real life. To be honest I \nthink violent games are very useful because a lot of violence gets \nchanneled into them instead of real life fights or murders while creative \ngames might be detrimental because people live out their creative fantasies \ningame instead making them happen in real life. Who knows how many great \narchitects we have lost because they play Minecraft instead going to school \nand pursuing a relevant career and how many school shootings have been \ncancelled due to the shooter being satisfied with a round or two of \nBattlefield?"}}]}, "z12fefb4twvuc51cy233t1op4q2agt3ri04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFAU5Vwk51n-BIMP3uWxmjA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cluCSWfxHDI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE0/xJZmo16V5Z8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Fat Autistic Nlgger", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-28T05:33:57.794Z", "videoId": "Kc5E0BtWjbE", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCFAU5Vwk51n-BIMP3uWxmjA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.98242151999999994, "formal_score": 38, "updatedAt": "2015-07-28T05:33:57.794Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113734856587733546022", "textDisplay": "no such thing as sandy hoax\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13gfnl55n2wgxib104cfhohmrbjsddje3o": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGPjXW1tEflFbf17GDGPeAQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Just_Bri", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-17T19:59:53.484Z", "videoId": "Kc5E0BtWjbE", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGPjXW1tEflFbf17GDGPeAQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.76367999999999991, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-01-17T19:59:53.484Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111223174159364062646", "textDisplay": "You guys did a terrible job at dissecting his interview...

DNA is found belonging to another \ncriminal in the New York state database, but the Police don\u2019t feel the need \nto follow up on it.\nNancy Lanza, of which there are three photographs in existence of, is \ncharacterized by the media as a \u201cprepper\u201d.  In not one single crime scene \nphoto of the interior of her house is there any food, water, or medical \nsupplies stored.\nThen, the 112 pound, six foot tall, Asperger\u2019s syndrome suspect, who hates \nbright lights and crowds and who sleeps in a room that is blacked out with \nplastic, drives past a high school that he did attend, goes to an \nelementary school that he has absolutely no connection to, and parks his \ncar out front, leaving all four doors open and two black sweatshirts on the \nground according to eyewitnesses on the day of the shooting.  He leaves his \nshotgun in the trunk.  No DNA or fingerprints belonging to Lanza are found \nin or on the car.\nLanza who is also diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and always \nwears khaki pants and white socks, dresses in black, wearing a mask, and \nbody armor (how did he acquire that?) and enters the school by shooting a \nhole in the front window glass, leaving residue from a shotgun breaching \nround on the bookcase by the broken window.\nLoaded with two handguns, several magazines for each hand gun, and a \nBushmaster AR-15 rifle (which is, at the time, already illegal to own in \nCT) Lanza enters the school and begins to shoot. Lt. Vance stated it was \nregistered in Nancy Lanza\u2019s name, how can that be when it\u2019s illegal?. \nAlong with the AR-15 rifle there are enough rounds in magazines to fire \nmore than 200 rounds during the time of the incident.  This equates to \napproximately two shots per second during the elapsed time of the \nincident.  In the 911 tapes available online, not one gunshot is heard in \nthe background of any call.  The witnesses inside, both adult and child, \nstated they heard a \u201ccouple of bangs\u201d like the \u201cjanitor was knocking \nsomething over\u201d, or \u201c someone was kicking the door\u201d.  They then said that \nthey heard the shots over the intercom, which the Principal, thoughtfully \nleft turned on.\n112 pound Lanza goes on a shooting rampage, carrying an estimated 65 pound \nof equipment, firing at least 8, 30 round magazines and a matter of minutes \nwith a 96.1% kill to wound ratio, which is higher than any school shooting \nin the history of the world.\nDr. Carver, states that Lanza shot himself in the mouth with the 10 mm \nGlock but the police report states that he shot himself in the back of the \nhead with tissue and hair stuck to the front sight of the Glock 10mm.  A \ncrime scene photo of the boonie hat is published with visible blonde hairs \nstuck to it.  Lanza has dark brown hair.\nNo Lanza DNA was found on any of the unfired cartridges, but DNA from \nLauren Rousseau and Dawn Hochsprung was found on unfired rounds inside of \nthe magazines.  How did that get there?  148 fired bullets and fragments \nwere sent for testing but no one of them could be positively matched to the \nAR-15 or the GLock 10 mm, the only guns fired in the school.\nA Garmin Nuvi GPS unit is recorded as being seized, but the report says \nthat it came from both the Lanza House and the Honda Civic parked at the \nfront of the school.  Which is it?\nNewtown Board of education records are searched and it is found that there \nis no operating or maintenance budget for fiscal year 2012-2013 and the \nminutes of the other school board meetings are scrubbed from the website \nwithin days of the event.\nThe town and families have, to date, shared in over $33 million with an M \nin federal and private donations.  Why do these affluent people need this \namount of money?  A CT State Trooper is assigned to the remaining families \nin CT and no one may talk to them without the trooper being present.  This \nhas NEVER been done before.\nNot one single crime scene photo of an identifiable dead adult or child has \nbeen released where the body is placed at the scene or having an autopsy \nperformed.  No crime scene photos showing any amount of blood have been \nreleased from classroom 8,9,or 10, where all the killings took  place.  All \nfunerals were closed casket, with the exception of one, Pozner, who had a \ncloth covering the lower portion of his face.\nLt. Vance\u2019s, (the CT State Police spokesman) son  just happened to be \nappointed to the CT Board of Control a short time after the incident, and \nis the sole person in the state who decides if a lawsuit can be brought \nagainst the state.  CT is the only state in the country with such a \nposition.

While it is a bit disturbing, \nnone of what Lanza said here is outside the realm of curiosity and thought. \nWe obviously know that there was something deeper going on with Lanza, but \notherwise, it simply sounds like contemplation on modern society, something \nI don't think there's enough of. Now, all the other stuff, and the fact \nthat he called an Anarchist radio show to speak this is disturbing. But \nLanza made a good point about society.\n\nThe chimp is an interesting parallel because it's an animal, something we \ngenerally think of as wild, but it was also a domesticated pet and one that \npeople often thought of as nice and friendly. Until this incident happened. \nLikewise, people can do certain things for which we have no real \nexplanation. We can't know what Lanza was thinking when he did what he did, \nbut he certainly did make real exactly what he was talking about  in that \ninterview: no one would have suspected that he would carry out such an act. \nWho could have? Even with red flags and all the help in the world, without \nknowing the cause of why Lanza did what he did, how could this have been \nprevented? Like the chimp, he committed a random act of violence that no \none saw coming.\n\nI don't think it's crazy or a red flag to ponder this aspect of humanity. \nIn fact, I'd say it's insightful to view humans as animals with the \npotential to defy expectations and act randomly. I also think that, what he \nmeans in his remarks about civilization make sense in a certain way of \nseeing society. We, as humanity, are wild creatures who are taught to be \ncivilized. It's not something we know, it's not something ingrained in us, \nit's something we're taught. Which is why civilization, from place to \nplace, differs. There are similarities and there are differences. It sounds \nlike, maybe, Lanza was frustrated with something, or fascinated by the \nidea. The fact that he mentions children in his interview is a parallel to \nwhat he did as well. I think that, for as crazy as we want to make Lanza \nout to be, and he very likely was, he also seems like he was perceptive and \nhad a lot going on in his head in terms of thinking about society. It seems \nto me that you guys are simply dismissing this because he was a crazy dude \nwho shot up kids.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmGwIm4vNWUgzPVvGazKjqA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "genericname1", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12kvjb5vrf0ybnmz23ojxmisxqqudyo504", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-17T18:28:51.285Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmGwIm4vNWUgzPVvGazKjqA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.98723985999999997, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-17T18:28:51.285Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3P5M0Bme9Xc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/y3nHqG6YCLo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111759757908497413767", "textDisplay": "Well said."}}]}, "z12dtr2xnmymjdqcb232e3jaitfcehnot04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCURJhA5JKvZDy5dRdlqC6iQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "fordhouse8b", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-17T13:51:30.644Z", "videoId": "Kc5E0BtWjbE", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCURJhA5JKvZDy5dRdlqC6iQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.66241599999999989, "formal_score": 98, "updatedAt": "2014-01-17T13:51:30.644Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101219675477865191302", "textDisplay": "Since when did being diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome (a very broad and \nnebulously defined diagnosis) become equated with being mentally ill?

A lot of things like subtext, tone, emotional imagery, body \nlanguage and even sarcasm, which most people grasp intuitively, Aspies \nhave to get intellectually. Kind of a mute point with Lanza, who did turn \nviolent, but it is perfectly possible that he wasn't using the chimp event \nor shootings for dramatic effect or anything other than to support his \nviewpoint.

We all have that capability and the \nonly thing really stopping us from going ape-shit on each other is that we \nhave been conditioned from birth to be civilized. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12bybuzcwfxfn3oe04chdvikoemxrfqy2o": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-wGZ4AMr_Qx1JCq0NZV2A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HorYC8ZFiIk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/nAALkI6Ugds/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 5.4054054054054053, "authorDisplayName": "Hammerhead547", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-17T05:12:13.023Z", "videoId": "Kc5E0BtWjbE", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCG-wGZ4AMr_Qx1JCq0NZV2A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.030456000000000039, "formal_score": 87, "updatedAt": "2014-01-17T05:12:13.023Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107078877246343740148", "textDisplay": "Hows this for a \"reason\" why that piece of shit doing what he did:\n\nHE WAS A FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsEZvxp8YoGXH49D98Sptug", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "emerald3331", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12bybuzcwfxfn3oe04chdvikoemxrfqy2o", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-17T05:47:12.516Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCsEZvxp8YoGXH49D98Sptug"}, "sentiment_score": -0.03625600000000001, "formal_score": 44, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-17T05:47:12.516Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107258281618106115845", "textDisplay": "A lot of Wall Street bankers have the same syndrome.

And thats for \na reason. Who is going to say what is hate speech and what is not? A judge. \nSo its in the hands of a single person to determine what people can speak \nabout and what they cannot. Precisely what the bill of rights was trying to \navoid. If someone says that the sunnis are behind 911 that can qualify as \nhate speech, because it is arising hate against sunnis. If someone \ncriticizes Obama, that can be characterized as hate speech, because it \ncould promote hate against the president. And regarding guns, if someone \nthinks that he is afraid of getting robbed and thats why he wants to buy a \ngun, some shrinks can label that  person a mentally ill anxious paranoid \nand thus make that person unqualified to buy a gun. Also criticizing or not \nliking the government can also be labelled as a mental illness by some \nshrinks thus not only abridging freedom of speech but also abridging the \nright to bear arms. The problem with government regulation is that \ngovernment is not always the good guy, as you can see with the case of new \nyork detectives who were moonlighting for criminal groups and executing \npeople in traffic stops. So I understand the need for measures against \ndivisional hate that can create even civil wars but I also understand the \nneed to protect speech from possible corrupt and despotic leaning \ngovernment officials.

The \"chimp like state\" he \nreferred to is the uncivilized state.

A human baby and a monkey are equally capable \nof responding to the world up to a certain age, where the child surpasses \nthe chimp and continues to advance.\n\nThis being said, some people are born \"crazy\" and never become civilized. \nWe don't know how to clearly define what is wrong with them in all cases, \nbut they sometimes act in a violent way. Can't those people be compared to \nwild animals, compelled to act violently toward an end that we do not \nshare? If a guy shoots up a school, can't we, to some degree, consider him \nto be like a boa who eats a man or a dog who attacks a child, only pausing \nto add in that there are \"civilized\" people who hunt and trap animals for \nfun? A person who can kill for fun, like a hunter, and does not have strong \nties to humanity, like a nonhuman animal, can act upon his nature and kill \na large group of people for fun (unlike the snake who kills out of hunger \nor the dog who attacks out of territory or self defense).This is not a \nfeeling I hold personally, but one I can perceive in others. A crazy, \nsocio/psychopathic, delusional, unstable animal can harm a group of like \nanimals with no regard for the consequences. Humans are just animals, after \nall.\n\nSo, back to Lanza's point, why is it that the violent acts of the human \nanimal deserve more publicity than the violent acts of a nonhuman animal? \n\nI think it's because we are humans and get more emotionally invested in \nhumans, killers or otherwise, than we get in an animal.

Their rage and anger is projected inward \nto themselves. In lone nuts it is projected outward so they attack family \nmembers and then attack strangers until they kill themselves or they are \nare taken out by police marksmen.

the \nrisks. And the lazy, the impulse acts etc would be minimized too. We would \nalso make it easier to spot the things that are the telltale signs, for \nexample, in Sweden guns are so scarce that if you see someone with a gun \nthere will pretty much be a ripple effect through the entire town, and cops \nwill be called, which makes it harder to do gun crime in general if it's \nnot in the confines of your home or very well planned.\n\nAn example:\nAs a network technician I must think like a hacker to stop them, and I know \nfor a fact that you can't stop a hacker that REALLY REALLY wants to get \ninto any system.

The author of the original comment \nsuggested that this video published by TYT is propaganda specifically \nbecause it is furthering a false description of the political philosophy \nand here we are seen with an example of an individual, yourself, speaking \nabout anarchism in an extremely idiosyncratic manner. Throughout your \ncomment, the insinuation is made that anarchism is synonymous with \nright-wing radical libertariansim in which capitalism is left totally alone \nwithout statist intervention. This is, of course, another example of the \neffect of propaganda and Orwellian double-speak. \n\nTo clarify the points made by anarchism, it is not the belief that without \ngovernment, there would exist no social hierarchy. It is a common \nmisconception that anarchists oppose governance, but that is completely \nridiculous since anarchism itself is a method of organization, a method of \ngovernance. It is not government that anarchists reject, but the idea of a \nstate, which every anarchist holds to be synonymous with the idea of \ncapitalism. In essence, it is the concept that someone ought to have \ncontrol over matters which are none of his/her concern through the \ndomination of property. A capitalist's domination of capital, justified by \nnothing more substantive than the employment of armed thugs, is as equally \nwrong as a state's domination of a land, justified by nothing more \nsubstantive than the employment of armed thugs. \n\nYou claim that without government, power would ultimately fall in the hands \nof the very wealthy, and that's why anarchism fails as a political \nideology. This is quite a funny statement since practically every single \nanarchist would agree with you here. The rich and powerful do not have some \ninnate power, rather, their power is derived from a statist control of \nresources. Anarchists do not just seek to collapse the state and still \nretain capitalism, as though they are separate entities. Rather, anarchism \nwas literally founded as an anti-statist method of achieving socialism, \nworker's self-management. It is merely the belief that socialism is \npossible and desirable but cannot be achieved through statist appropriation \nof capital and property. To see what anarchists actually want and not what \nthe great propagandists tell you we want, I recommend the book \"The \nAnarchist Collectives\" by Murray Bookchin since it documents how two \nmillion anarchists syndicated and organized society in Spain during the \nSpanish Civil War. They retained an anarchist method of governance without \na state or capitalism.

Simple research, just little itty-bitty details \nand inconsistencies go a LONG way regarding the Sandy Hook shooting. Fun \nfact: in Connecticut's Death Index, Adam Lanza's death is recorded as \nhaving been entered a day before the shooting occurred (looked it up myself \nto see if it was bunk, it wasn't). Why would that be? What a lazy mistake \nto make. Why were no children being medically evacuated? You remember \nColumbine don't you? High-schoolers were being medivaced but they didn't do \nthat for little kindergartners? Really?\n\n\nLook I could berate you with facts and inconsistencies, but like so many \ndon't know, the 'truth' is not perpetuated by the media. You're yet to have \nthe paradigm shift that changes the way you look at things. The U.S \ngovernment bombs countless countries, they restrict our rights as \nindividuals, the politicians are corrupt as can be, they cover up scandals \nand sell weapons to terrorist organizations (that's a historical fact, it's \nin the books), hell the CIA has been caught MULTIPLE times in the past \nselling drugs to the cartels and even dealing within the U.S. So why \nwouldn't the government stage one little shooting after doing all these \ndeceptive things? It just makes perfect sense considering how at the time \nof the shooting, the government was looking for every reason to BAN Ar-15's \nand then suddenly, this perfect shooting, these kids are killed by a \nderanged gunman who somehow has 98% accuracy (someone actually calculated \nLanza's accuracy) despite the fact that NAVY SEALS don't even have that \nsort of skill when it comes to shooting.

Simply agreeing with anything he says is grounds off-limits in \nthis PC era.\n\nHowever, Lanza's radio interview is creepy. His voice comes across as \nindistinct at times and he continuously rambles on and on. Lanza's poor \nsocial skills are on display throughout the interview. Most shocking to me \nthough is his allusion to his future self, a mass shooter. Yet, hindsight \nis 20-20 and it's near impossible to determine that this guy was criminally \ninsane just by listening to him speak for several minutes. What Lanza said \nduring the interview (i.e. being born in a chimp like state) is like you \nsaid, pretty accurate."}}]}, "z12jixwxgo3bfhlza04ccnzplpuxjvjjagc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJ_p9TWanbuTFb3jTrP27w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uUkBkzyGT_Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/faIdzUR6D2M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "chilly rooster", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-17T10:31:05.896Z", "videoId": "Kc5E0BtWjbE", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQJ_p9TWanbuTFb3jTrP27w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.44157599999999997, "formal_score": 91, "updatedAt": "2014-01-17T10:31:05.896Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110893896763209277937", "textDisplay": "Show me proof he existed\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12bj5zz3xjqf3bxq04cftgysqnxud3zbg4": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr1K3gsCw6NhuBHTKLPiI3Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wd4N1eL4bH0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADRc/G_v_GDYd-Ro/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Nancy Catherine Groom", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-12T19:39:04.772Z", "videoId": "Kc5E0BtWjbE", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCr1K3gsCw6NhuBHTKLPiI3Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.90323960000000003, "formal_score": 9, "updatedAt": "2014-02-12T19:39:04.772Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113203722999932728083", "textDisplay": "Asspergers doesn't make you a terrible person,it's not a mental illness.i \nwould know I have it and I don't go around be violent because my \ndisability.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12nwrv5bkuttv01i22ge3ppbm3itv1kc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgVYNe9fMRZ3D6kw5bSGzgA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8lgNK4lnXtI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApc/S7AuDSKZHH0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ronnie Bishop", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-23T00:15:51.739Z", "videoId": "Kc5E0BtWjbE", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgVYNe9fMRZ3D6kw5bSGzgA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.096943999999999975, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-12-23T00:15:51.739Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110359378595324931186", "textDisplay": "Radio show?
