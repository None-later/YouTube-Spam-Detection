People need to understand that violence always follows violence \nand if you threaten anyone life or safety you should expect retaliation \nespecially when its from someone with a LICENSE and BADGE to KILL. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z122jpp4lqa5cfc2g22hi3vbkxu3zxhgu04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDM7zdh87ZUItyXS4qeG8ng", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ku24-zZlvqE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJA/JMts61CjlKE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "brian hoover", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-22T13:47:46.579Z", "videoId": "6-3DYmmjVMI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDM7zdh87ZUItyXS4qeG8ng"}, "sentiment_score": 0.66919200000000001, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2015-01-22T13:47:46.579Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104812480429659509070", "textDisplay": "when you us a car or a truck as a  deadly weapon unarmed or not it still a \ndeadly  weapon no mater the size of it the cops have the right to define \nthemes self's to . \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12rg5rz4obtvzbyn04cj3baluu0z5xq4yk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IDkxpM5Uokh6XDyfui7zg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "DarkCode", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-02T01:17:48.971Z", "videoId": "6-3DYmmjVMI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0IDkxpM5Uokh6XDyfui7zg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.36074999999999996, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2015-01-02T01:17:48.971Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110910599695692550020", "textDisplay": "This isn't police brutality man come on you are sounding stupid.

If you endanger a town, or college campus with a vehicle \nthe way he did, then attempt to injure or kill an officer with a \nVEHICLE(which is considered a weapon when used in this manner), the \nofficers have the legal grounds to return fire, so to speak.

A vehicle IS a weapon. Especially when used in this manner. Simple, \nfactual information.\n\n2. You are flat out WRONG with your interpretation of the law. No such law \nexists that police should not chase a \"stolen vehicle suspect\" that started \nFLYING through traffic before the officers even flashed him because the \nfather told them so... Or because they don't think he's dangerous. When you \nendanger the public, you are dangerous, obviously. What don't you \nunderstand about that? You have to understand that you are completely \nwrong. I would completely agree with you IF officers had trapped him in the \nintersection, guns drawn as if he had robbed the vehicle at gunpoint like a \nREAL criminal, and freaked him out to the point of fleeing in fear. But \nthat simply didn't happen. They hadn't even pulled him over when he fled. \nAny rationally thinking adult understands what should have happened here. \nYou flash your lights, kid pulls over, officer questions him and likely \nreprimands him for completely disrespecting his parents, officers take him \ninto custody , parents pick up vehicle. The adolescent's choice to flee and \nendanger countless lives, was his own. I think this is pretty cut and dry. \nThe choice to open fire on the boy is questionable at best, but you have to \ndefend yourself at some point. Opening fire on the tires of the truck is \nlikely the proper recourse here, but how do you determine that in the \nmoment? He already ran through a red light in moderate traffic going ~70mph \nwith zero regards for anyone else's safety. Do the officers not open fire \nand allow him to attempt the same stunt again, but this time he strikes a \nvehicle with a young mother, and two children in the back seat, killing all \n4 of them? The decision must be made in an instant to attempt to defend the \nthe safety of many, or risk more lives other than just the life of the \nperpetrator of a criminal act. The officers will now have to deal with \ntheir choice, but that is what they signed up for. Your oath is to protect \nthe public. I would have attempted shots on the vehicle's tires, but if I \nmiss, and he continues fleeing and kills a family and himself because I \nchose not to end his rampage when I had the chance, I would probably cry. \nAs a man, I can admit that it would possibly break me to know that I could \nhave changed the course of that incident by making a different decision in \nthat moment. You'll argue; \"This is why they should not have chased him, \nyou retard.\" They were given no choice. They attempted to pull him over in \na reasonable, and professional manner... and he chose to run and endanger \nthe public. I see your point, but they CAN NOT just allow him to run amuck \nthrough the town and endanger everyone else because he wanted to joyride. \nShooting HIM is a different debate, stopping him was necessary."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIM-chrPC97QPSMBdijtY6g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "eddieisfiction", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13fudppdra2ybqq104ciz1hvrzxyruwcwo0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-30T14:31:07.922Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCIM-chrPC97QPSMBdijtY6g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.43681600000000004, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-30T14:31:07.922Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113005673654293069818", "textDisplay": "+Brandon Bell If you are going to debate like an adult, then act like one. \n Don't sit there and go.  \"O he didn't have a weapon?

So why is it the cops were justified in \nusing weapons to stop the kid, but the kid was not justified in using a car \nas a weapon to stop them?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12lupc4uoyxhbgqt04cezqaxlepgvjxl1o": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeWtJeJRc12lw5AKhHNxrnA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "cshgeo", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-29T04:26:54.670Z", "videoId": "6-3DYmmjVMI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeWtJeJRc12lw5AKhHNxrnA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.86696010000000001, "formal_score": 97, "updatedAt": "2015-09-29T04:26:54.670Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111894438154349866086", "textDisplay": "Kid was not a victim.

Yes, there is ONE \"non-violent\" solution \nto this situation...(and let the record show now, it is NOT a solution I  \nagree with)...and the solution is abortion. Sad to say, this \"child\" as you \npeople keep referring to him as, is old enough to drive, old enough to make \nthe decision to become a criminal in the first place.  (I can only assume) \nThat his parents didn't teach him to be a criminal, they did not persuade \nhim to steal the truck, they didn't allow him to steal it, it was the \ndecision of this young man to take something that did not belong to him \nwithout permission.  Frankly, I have never seen a thief, murderer, rapist, \nor any criminal arbitrarily just give up (not saying it doesn't happen, \nbut...).  Maybe the guy had a death-wish, maybe he wanted to die. Maybe, \njust maybe, he feels about things just as you do, that \"I have the right to \ndo what I want, when I want, and if you tell me NOT to do it, I'm going to \ndo it anyway\".  Life is about choices, and we make choices.  For most of \nus, we don't make the choice to put ourselves into dangerous situations \nthat will end our lives, as this guy did.  Most every decision we make, \nthere is always a \"good and a bad choice\", or in some cases, \"a bad choice \nand a not as bad choice\", and the majority of the population will choose \n\"the lesser of two evils\".  Once you start down a criminal path, the latter \nis usually the case. With age comes wisdom, and with wisdom, comes more \nthan two choices in most cases, barring the fact that we haven't completely \nslipped past the point of no return. In which case, you have two choices, \nface the music and pay for your transgressions, or die because of them.  \nThis guy, old enough to make his choices, wasn't wise enough to see the \npath that he had chosen was the wrong path, and it led to his demise.  Was \nthe police in the wrong in this case?  As far as I can tell from just this \nvideo, no.
