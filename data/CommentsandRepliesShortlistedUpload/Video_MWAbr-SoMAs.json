He raised the \ndead yet allowed himself to be captured, beaten, spit upon, crucified, and \neventually gave up His own life in the brutal death on a cross. Most \nimportantly, that blood, His blood, will be our atoning sacrifice when we \nstand before God's judgment.\n\nOn the third day after the crucifixion, Christ's dead body was taken from \nthat cross and placed inside a tomb where he lay for 3 days. But on the \nthird day, he Came back to life, was seen by over a hundred people after \nrising from the dead in the weeks before he ascended back into heaven to \nprepare a place for us when we die.\n\nThen we ,as Christians, ask the unsaved to believe the history of our \nfaith, and not to worry about Genesis 1-11. This has been a difficult issue \nfor me in my 46 year history. I have learned that God can do whatever He \nwants, it doesn't have to make sense to me, check out Job 38.\n\nAm I really suppose to tell the unbelievers that the same God that \nbrought His Son to the earth to suffer the punishment of sin for me, so I \nhave the opportunity to believe in Him and accept Him as my Lord \nand Savior, isn't the same God that created this universe in 6 literal \ndays. \n\nAm I to tell them that the same God that judged the world in a global \nflood, with global earthquakes and tsunamis, splitting the earths crust \nof Pangaea and dividing the continents, that made mountains rise, and \nvalleys fall, and destroyed every living thing on this planet, due to their \nevil, \"don't worry about believing that\"? \"It's o.k. to believe instead \nin uniformitarianism, because the way things are today, is the way \nthey have always been.\"  \n\nAm I to tell them to just be concerned that they believe in Jesus and make \na decision to put their faith in Him before they die, or before Christ \nreturns to the earth for His people, \"Christians\"? Yes, that is what I \nbelieve we are to do, and we are motivated by the Holy Spirit, and the \nbrevity of life to do so, as well as the fact that we shall all stand \nbefore God's judgment. We share our faith based upon the Bible, and backed \nup by there by 2nd Timothy 3:16, with everyone? By the way, that same Bible \ntell us not only what is going to happen in the future, but what happened \nin the beginning as well.\n\nSince we know what the Bible tells us, aren't we allowing the lines that we \ndraw, confuse us, as well as the non-Christians?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13quzlravrssnitf23sy5040v3shpdsp": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq2lcLdVz-pLx5W4FQcL1GQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Alex Ferus", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T09:02:01.108Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCq2lcLdVz-pLx5W4FQcL1GQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.92349590000000004, "formal_score": 70, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T09:02:01.108Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111261887229532643243", "textDisplay": "well I believe In creationist conclusion evolution is a lie, because \ntheres  proof for creation not evolution .believe what you want but that's \na fact \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ntxzytrivhdxe423vd3hiytv2dnkxl04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeM3LgOlSwnzWHtvQp71tug", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "XMetalMatter", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-06T07:58:11.170Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeM3LgOlSwnzWHtvQp71tug"}, "sentiment_score": -0.317666, "formal_score": 74, "updatedAt": "2014-02-06T07:58:11.170Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113069739521350328587", "textDisplay": "At least Pat comes to terms about the age of the Earth and saying that Ken \nHam is a clown.

Many of my college professors have presented the evidence to back \nthis up, and it's quite obvious to me that our planet is truly ancient. But \njust because of it's alleged age, does that mean there's no way that a \nsupreme being could have created Earth billions of years ago? Absolutely \nnot--too many Creationists take everything the Bible says literally. Yes, \nit's a bloodline that adds up to 6,000 years, but how do we know the Bible \nis telling us everything that happened? It says the world was created in \nseven days, not seven CONSECUTIVE days. We can see the proof if dinosaurs \nfrom millions of years ago. We know it happened, because the fossil \nevidence proves it. But who's to say that God didn't create the dinosaurs \none day and then millions of years later create man? Now I'm no \npaleontologist, and I may not be precise with the timeline of dinosaur life \non Earth, but it seems plausible to me to think that God created the \ndifferent aspects of our planet on different days through--as far as we \nknow--billions of years. Now you may say the Bible isn't relevant because \nso much is unexplained. But of course the Bible isn't gonna tell us EVERY \nSINGLE THING that was created and when it was so. God made man with the \nability to think and discover. Wouldn't he want us to find out these things \nourselves? And He was in no hurry to create light, the stars and planets, \nand all life on Earth. So why MUST it always be seven consecutive days?

So from the right perspectives you can see how \ntime is many things to many people, from one angle is nothing more then a \nspin that repeats, and yet from another angle does not even exist at all.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ey5kh4smtsljjo04cflwb4sqrdpxol1c": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvTZZ5vlzerDFUGb7nCvVGg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bill C.", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-06T16:57:36.793Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCvTZZ5vlzerDFUGb7nCvVGg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.87913240000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-02-06T16:57:36.793Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102965921280019276422", "textDisplay": "I'm an Old Earth Creationist!!!

Gee sounds like you believe you're here on probation..What \nis faith? Faith is openness to truth to reality what ever it may turn out \nto be. Isn't faith letting go and not clinging on to things? To use ideas \nabout the universe and about god as something to hang on to. In the spirit \nof rock of ages cleft for me, And there's something very rigid about a \nrock. And we are finding our rock getting rather worn out in age where it \nbecomes more and more obvious that our world is a floating world. Its a \nworld floating in space. Where all positions are relative and any point may \nbe regarded as the center. A world which doesn't float on anything and \ntherefore the religious attitude appropriate to our time is not one of \nclinging to rocks but of learning to swim. And you know if you get into the \nwater and you have nothing to hold on to and you try to behave as you would \non dry land you will drown. But if on the other hand if you trust yourself \nto the water and let go you will float. And this is exactly the situation \nof faith. Imagine the idea that when you were born you were kicked off the \nedge of a precipice and you're falling. As you fell a lump of rock came \nwith you and was traveling along side you. And you're clinging to it for \ndear life. And thinking gee I gotta hold on to this, Well it doesn't do a \nthing for you. And its only making you anxious and its when you understand \nthat it doesn't do a thing for you to let go and relax. So everybody's in \nthis situation were all completely insecure were all heading straight for \ndeath as if we've been condemned by a judge. And yet here we are all \nclinging onto things. And we have all sorts of alibis for doing this, well \nI have responsibilities for my dependence and I have got to cling on but \nall your doing is teaching your dependence to cling on the same way as you \nare. And making them miserable by learning to go on surviving compulsively. \nWe're all in this great stream of change which we call life. We are the \nstream. If you imagine you're separate from it and you're being carried \nalong by it as if you  were a cork that's an illusion. You are the wave of \nthe stream its self.

Regardless of what you say, Ham is not the official spokesman for \nall religious people in the same way that Dawkins is not the official \nspokesman for all atheists. As I said before, I accept evolution, but I \nalso believe in God, and I take issue when anti-religious people promote \nbigotry against religious people, even good spirited religious people who \nwant nothing more than to just love and get along with everybody in the \nspirit of Jesus, and I know plenty of atheists who feel the same way, and \nwhile they might not believe in God or in the divinity of Jesus, they also \nbelieve in living and let live and to just get along with everyone, and I \nrealize that religious discrimination has been an issue that the scientific \ncommunity and the atheist community has dealt with, but don't pretend that \nit's a one way street, I see just as many anti-religious bigotry even \nagainst people like me who accept Evolution simply because they're offended \nthat I believe in a greater power, and that's not right, as I'm a \nprogressive and side with Democrats on most issues, but for some militants \nI've met that's just not enough for them.

And sure, the description of the \"big bang\" or other \nsimilar notions could possibly hint at a more descriptive picture in which \nGod did it. As far as how LONG it took Him to create the heavens and the \nearth requires little time and interpretation of His Word.\n\n\"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

I'm well aware of \nthe countless false doctrines and teachers within/without the church, and \nit is this factor that I make sure I leave no stone un-turned. The reality \nis, we do know that in this context, when God refers to a day(yowm) it is \ndefined by \"evening and morning\". Literally, ONE DAY. In Genesis 1:14 it \nreads,\n\n\"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide \nthe day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for \ndays, and years:\"\n\nDays, and years\u2026 \n\nYear(shaneh) in this passage, is the same root word to define a person's \nage. Ex. Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years. \n\nIt is clear that none of this is metaphorical. I believe this was an \nintentional choice of words on Yahweh's part to prevent confusion, and \nanswer the very question we are discussing. That being said, this still \ndoes not conclude the precise age of the earth. \n\nYes, this subject has very little importance to our salvation. And I agree \nwe should spend our time glorifying The Lord.

Going further, they were tortured in the most vile \nmethods, including crucifixion, and worse...\n\nAnyone stepping out of line would suffer a terrible death.\n\nThe doctrines that Christians and other religions follow were *imposed* by \nthis punishment. I know this threat persists today in many countries.\n\nWe need to understand how these faiths survived. Institutions (initially \nsmall groups of men) that purported myths and propagated fear in a time \nwhen you could find a \"messiah\" every square mile... in an oppressed and \nimpoverished society where people WANTED a savior. People wanted to \nbelieve. The concept of heaven would seem pretty tempting if I were living \nin \"hell on earth,\" I'll admit.\n\nI know I'm only coming from one angle. The conundrum that we find ourselves \nin now, is how we (Atheists, nontheists, secularists, etc), having moved \naway from ancient dogma, can actually talk to people of faith without \ncreating animosity...\n\nAnd I see a LOT of \"atheists\" giving each other a bad rep. Some atheists \njust want to insult and belittle believers. We're just having trouble \ncommunicating. . I would like to think most of us really just want to try \nand reverse the *real* damage that's been done; to get a tourniquet on \nreason and move forward.\n\nLook, I don't think it's irrational to want to believe in an afterlife, \nthat's fine by me. But we don't need to be reverent of a higher power- \nYou're free to think. We aren't being tested. No original sin, no divine \njudgement.

Quite \nfrankly I wouldn't nor does any man, nor will we for a LONG time, \ncomprehend the universe. Want to fry your brain? Look up quantum mechanics. \nI believe in God because besides the fact I know for a fact he exists, I \nhold to the idea that I will have a place to go to after death.

Also the mere fact that Heaven must \nbe pure, and sinners are not allowed, unless Jesus has forgiven all of \ntheir sins, which they must accept Him for. Evolution (big E) is completely \nirrelevant in this analogy, this is talking about what the Bible says and \nwhat Christians believe Jesus was. The God character Created the Earth and \nhas no reason to let us live, but has shown grace by giving us the choice \nto do right or wrong. Then He has died to forgive those who ask to be \nforgiven of their sins. That way they can be with Him (100% pure) in heaven \n(100% pure) after their life on earth. (not 100% pure unless forgiven by \nJesus) It is you who have made a TERRIBLE analogy, and who obviously knows \nlittle to nothing of the subject."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb94cEHbtAKKJ8NAyhy0x5A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bocephus Blue", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12jd5bbyxeytfva204ccrhiouf0d554dis", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-17T20:37:54.010Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCb94cEHbtAKKJ8NAyhy0x5A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.80287839999999999, "formal_score": 67, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-17T20:37:54.010Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vTcQgV1KSj8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADo/FsTUQKXfZg0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110777517417115842102", "textDisplay": "+Pecola1FromScratch Your analogy is terrible;\nThe god character is a robber with a gun shouting \"Give me your money, \ndon't make me shoot you!\"\n\nFurthermore, you don't actually know what the Theory of Evolution \ndescribes, do you?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ6i04DaByghg886sLKlIyA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Pecola1FromScratch", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12jd5bbyxeytfva204ccrhiouf0d554dis", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-17T20:11:54.404Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZ6i04DaByghg886sLKlIyA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.018356000000000039, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-17T20:11:54.404Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pA5YseTdyYk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/p-svbrOhKSI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115948020485747371234", "textDisplay": "+yoo toob Knock Knock\n--Who's there?\n\"Jesus.

Was \nthe field decaying before that? Fortunately, there is a scientific way to \nanswer that question.\n\n\"Archaeomagnetism\" is the study of the magnetization of bricks, pottery, \ncampfire stones, and other man-related objects studied by archaeologists. \nIron oxides in those objects retain a record of the strength and direction \nof the earth's magnetic field at the time they last cooled to normal \ntemperatures. Archaeomagnetic data taken worldwide show that the intensity \nof the earth's magnetic field was about 40% greater in 1000 A.D. than it is \ntoday, and that it has declined steadily since then.[7]\n\nSuch a rapid decay could not have been going on continuously for millions \nof years, because the field would have to have been impossibly strong in \nthe past in order for it to still exist today. Creationists of the 1970s \nextrapolated today's decay back into the past, showing that the field could \nnot be more than about 10,000 years old, assuming a constant decay of \nintensity.\n\nUnfortunately, the archaeomagnetic data do not support that assumption.[7] \nInstead, the data show that the field intensity at the earth's surface \nfluctuated wildly up and down during the third millennium before Christ \n(see figure 1). A final fluctuation slowly increased the intensity until it \nreached a peak (50% higher than today) at about the time of Christ. Then it \nbegan a slowly accelerating decrease. By about 1000 A.D., the decrease was \nnearly as fast as it is today."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYwpPPyBkIFuBm7fMXBHctQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "rodlurks66", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z122yhwarw2qtrlsa23txfzamqidelx4b04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-09T22:19:27.060Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYwpPPyBkIFuBm7fMXBHctQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.84887809999999997, "formal_score": 97, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-09T22:19:27.060Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-F5sxbgO36tU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/FdJgisKWz-g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103315043036957996154", "textDisplay": "+Bruco Alidas Try the wayback machine if it \"had been there\" for any length \nof time.

In Tamil culture \nthis star cluster is attributed to Lord Murugan (Lord Murugan raised by the \nsix sisters known as the K\u0101rththikai Pengal and thus came to be known as \nK\u0101rtikeyan).

The cluster of dots in the upper \nright portion of the disk is believed to be the Pleiades.\nThe Babylonian star catalogues name the Pleiades MUL.MUL or \"star of \nstars\", and they head the list of stars along the ecliptic, reflecting the \nfact that they were close to the point of vernal equinox around the 23rd \ncentury BC. The earliest known depiction of the Pleiades is likely a bronze \nage artifact known as the Nebra sky disk, dated to approximately 1600 BC. \nSome Greek astronomers considered them to be a distinct constellation, and \nthey are mentioned by Hesiod, and in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. They are \nalso mentioned three times in the Bible (Job 9:9 and 38:31, as well as Amos \n5:8).

A mineral-rich solution springs up from the bottom and fills \nthe 15 m lake with steaming hot acidic water. This mineral-rich water then \nruns over the edge as a waterfall.\nDuring Noah\u2019s Flood, conditions would have been highly favourable for rapid \npetrification.\n\nThey discovered that the naturally fallen wood in the overflow had been \npetrified with silica. What surprised the scientists was the fact that the \nwood was less than 36 years old. As a result, the scientists conducted an \nexperiment in which they fastened pieces of fresh wood in the lake with \nwire.

Yashua (Jesus) did not have an \nearthly father and did not have the nature to sin.\n\nAs for ignoring science, well, so far, when scientists have disagreed with \nthe Bible, time and again, they have had to revise what they believe \nbecause their ideas keep getting disproved. This is why evolution keeps \nevolving.\n\nThe Bible told us about the hydrocycle long before \"science\" understood it. \nThe Bible told us about the earth revolving long before science figured it \nout. The Bible told us about the shape of the earth back when \"scientists\" \nstill thought the earth was flat.\n\nTo be sure, there were many in the church that did not trust the Bible and \nthought the earth was flat, but that was not because of what the Bible \nsaid. It was because they were listening to the thoughts of man rather than \ntrusting what God has revealed.\n\nGod has also revealed to us that we have sinned. We need to repent.

Chester's explanation does not apply in these cases. However, \nthe flood model does not explain them either. The trees are still rooted in \nplace, which would not happen if they were buried in a flood that \ncompletely reorganized the earth's surface into many layers of sediment. \nThe trees are found in this condition where there was a local disaster of \nsome sort. In these beautifully preserved forests, we can even find \ndinosaur footprints on top of the peat, beneath the coal, which should give \npause to anyone who believes that both layers were formed by a global flood \n(http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/coalprints.html).\nFor me, one of the most convincing items on this earth that discredits a \nyoung age is the volcanic island chains, such as the Hawaiian islands. \nThese islands were formed by hotspots in the earth's mantle (such as the \nHawaii hotspot), that spew out magma that dries into volcanic islands. \nHowever, the earth's plates move, causing a chain of smaller extinct \nvolcanos to form, rather than a single large active volcano. \nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Hawaii_hotspot_cross-sectional_diagram.jpg \n.

First off I came \nacross this video on accident and facepalmed after watching it then I went \nto the comment section to see what hate the atheist are saying about the \nChristian community because after this video they have a lot of fuel. Then \nI came across your argument with a couple of people. It took me like 20 min \nto read it all and study everything that you said to see that it's fact and \nwhat I've come across is mind boggling.\n\nI'd like to add that I'm a 17 year old open minded Christian who sees the \nflaws and ignorance in the church but never have I ever come across a \nChristian who is arguing that the Bible doesn't teach that homosexuality is \nwrong rather homosexuality mixed idolatry. This was a new interesting topic \nof debate and I wanted to see how you backed it up. \n\nLet me applaud you first for being so aggressive and standing firm in your \nargument. I learned a lot and your argument was almost flawless aside from \na few time where you said you shouldn't judge anyone and then you went on \nto judge him for his looks. That was probably apart of your argument about \nLeviticus and you were probably trying to use his same logic and it \nignorance to point his stupidity. Please clarify for me on that \n\nAnyway back on topic reading the entire argument and I myself being brought \nup in the Christian church all my life and being taught that homosexuality \nis wrong I never once did pick up the bible and read for myself. I read the \nwhole chapter now and see where you're coming from. My only question and \nI'm not trying to spark up a debate rather just a conversation and a \nlearning experience for me because I don't get taught anything to do with \nreal controversial topic at church or in school. \n\n1. You yourself said that the children of Israel were told not to be like \nthe people that they left and to not be like the people they're going to \n(please excuse my lack of citing I'm on my phone and I'm too lazy lol) if \nthe ones that they left are having gay sex in the name of an idol then \nisn't that the same of having gay sex in against the name of the Lord. You \nsee what I'm saying just because they don't have an idol doesn't mean they \naren't sinning right? Homosexual people are typically not Christian (sorry \nfor the logical fallacy) and have God in their hearts so is that the same \nif not worse than worshipping a lifeless thing in the name of sin. Is this \njust some message from God saying these people who have sex and get married \nto the same sex are OK because they're equal to the nonbelievers. But we as \nChristians shouldn't be like the nonbelievers as you know. Idk I'm just \nasking right now since you're pretty smart\n\n2 Why is it that God put Adam and eve on this earth and not Adam and Adam \nor vice versa. Do you think that he is trying to convey the message that \naddresses the argument that being gay is a sin even without idolatry? \nSurely he would've stated that homosexuality is a sin clearly somewhere in \nthe bible. Could this be it? \n\nLastly I'd like to say thanks for filling me in that we don't live under \nLevitical law anymore. I never new that but when you said we were saved it \nbecame clear to me. I'm looking forward to this conversation.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9YLQGop2EJh6EF2oclZSOA", "inappropriate_score": 0.049140049140049137, "authorDisplayName": "xSlappykinkaidx", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qh3eilxapvvgyi04cg1gp1ni5jx1zmbs", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-04T03:01:12.630Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9YLQGop2EJh6EF2oclZSOA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.40907399999999999, "formal_score": 38, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-03-04T03:01:12.630Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107997364393084699991", "textDisplay": "Thank you for your comments & questions. I would be more than happy to \nclarify these issues for you.\n\nAs for your 1st question, I can understand how my argument can be a bit \ndificult to really wrap you head around, especially if you have been taught \nfor a long time that homosexuality is wrong.\n\nIf I am understanding what you are asking, You are wondering if, even in \nthe absence of the idolatry in modern homosexuality, if it is still a sin. \n\nI know that the idea that Homosexuality might not be a sin can be a real \ndifficult thing to wrap your head around, especially if you have grown up \nin an atmosphere where homosexuality is deemed a sin no ifs &s or buts. So \nit can be kid of difficult to not just jump to the assumption that \nhomosexuality is a sin by default even when the very scripture that we \nthough establishes that rhetoric is in question as to what it really says.\n\nIn answer to your question, No. I don't believe that homosexuality in & of \nitself is a sin. The reason why we as Christians thought it was a sin to \nbegin with is because we mistranslated the scriptures regarding \nhomosexuality. So when we really study the scripture & find that it does \nnot match our original perceived rhetoric, it then forces us to re-evaluate \nthe entirety of that rhetoric.\n\nSo with that in mind, lets review the details. There are actually 2 reasons \nwhy homosexuality was considered to be a sin in Biblical culture. The one \nthat I already addressed, (the idolatry part) is the one that we can \nconclude, based on scripture, is God's official word on it, the other was a \ncultural presumption based on ignorance of how reproduction works.\n\nSo recapping on the idolatry part, the Caananites, Amorites, Hittites & \nPhilistines worshiped Pagan God's including Moloch, Baal, Ishtar & Astarte. \nPart of that worship included sexual fertility rites with male temple \nprostitutes.\n\n& since homosexual / same sex relationships did not exist in those times, \nFertility rites & other forms of sexual pagan worship with temple priests & \nprostitutes was the exclusive application of homosexuality, (with the \nexception of orgies where some homosexuality occurred later on in Roman & \nGreek culture). \n\nSo that means, in that time, if 2 men were having sex, one of them was a \nAssinu temple priest. & the purpose for the sexual intercourse was not for \npleasure or expression of love to the other, but for fertility rites & \npagan idolatry. So if anyone caught those 2 men, they wouldn't be saying \n\"HEY! YOU! STOP MAKING LOVE AS A FORM OF EXPRESSION OF YOUR LOVE FOR EACH \nOTHER! THAT IS A SIN FOR REASONS THAT CANNOT REALLY BE QUANTIFIED!\" They \nwould instead react with \"HEY! YOU! STOP ENGAGING IN WORSHIP OF FALSE GODS \nWITH THAT IDOLATROUS PAGAN PRIEST! THAT IS A SIN BECAUSE YOU ARE BREAKING \nTHE COMMANDMENT NOT TO WORSHIP FALSE GODS!\"\n\nSo as you can see, the only reason why homosexuality was deemed a sin to \nbegin with, was because it was in those times a tool for idolatry. Idolatry \nwas the actual sin, & therefore homosexuality was an extension of idolatry \nin how it was practiced. That means that if you remove the idolatry \nelement, which is the case in a monogamous & committed long term same sex \nrelationship, The sin that made homosexuality a sin by extension is no \nlonger attached to it, therefor meaning that homosexuality is not a sin.\n\nNow that other factor that I mentioned earlier about reproductive ignorance \nwas that globally, back in those times it was believed that the Male \ncarried the seed or \"essence\" of life in his semen, This amplified the \n degree of opposition to homosexuality because they believed that if a \nman's \"seed\" went anywhere other than into a woman's vajay jay, where it \ncould grow into a fetus, That man was committing murder by letting that \n\"seed\" die.\n\nSo when the people of Caanan engaged in fertility rites with Assinu Temple \npriests, they believed that by giving a sacrifice of their life essence to \nthe priest, the gods would bless them with fertile crops, livestock, etc...\n\nSo the Hebrew people saw homosexuality as especially heinous because not \nonly was it worship of false God's, but it was also in their minds, human \nsacrifice & murder. So we can see why they had such a harsh & oppositional \nstance towards homosexuality.\n\nNow obviously, with what we know now in modern times thanks to modern \nscience, is that the male does not actually carry the seed of life. We know \nthat women actually carry that seed, (the ovarian egg), & all that semen \ndoes is fertilize the egg, thereby negating the myth that with males, \n\"spilling your seed\" is relatively harmless. Not only that, but we actually \nnow know that periodically spilling your seed is not only good for the \nquality of the seed, (sperm count & such), but also helps prevent prostate \ncancer.\n\nAs for your comment that most homosexuals are not Christians, statistically \nyou are correct. However the bad news is that fundamentalist & bigoted \npseudo Christians are to blame for that. I mean when so many people who \nclaim to be Christians spend so much time abusing, oppressing, judging & \nover all showing nothing but abject hatred & condemnation towards them, can \nyou blame them for wanting nothing to do with Christianity? & that is the \nREAL sin in my opinion, That all these bigoted, gay bashers who think they \nare somehow holy & righteous in their bigotry, not only completely violate \nChrist's greatest commandment to love as he loved, but they push all those \npeople away from Christ with their bigoted blasphemy & false witness. So \nnot only are they robbing all those people from knowing God's love, but \nthey are in for a severely rude awakening when they stand before God's \njudgement & they realize that what they thought was doing God's will was \nnot only vile & bigoted oppression & abuse, but also essentially anti \nChristian works to push people away from Christ.\n\nI hope this clarifies things for you."}}]}, "z12wjlfqxoalwtrof04cgxrgwmvcfvuqgt00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 15, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG4Pw6X8Kx8vK9xMUSoj9AQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-G9B-96N1sn4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAU8/U_Z4QT2i2TU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Patricia Mitchell", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-04T22:35:42.780Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCG4Pw6X8Kx8vK9xMUSoj9AQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.31290400000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-07-04T22:35:42.780Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110910775500809012861", "textDisplay": "God created men and women and told them to replenish the earth.

And the act of causing Adam and Eve to sin \nhas caused death among numerous other things that has literally caused \nnations to be weakened and to fall.\n\nOne cool thing that I find is that this verse has the first referencing in \nthe Bible to Jesus. The \"her Seed\" and \"His heel\" both have capitals in \nthem which would indicate a higher importance in them that is normally only \nused for when talking about God. And since Jesus was born from Mary he \ncould be called the Seed of Eve. As for the seed of the serpent I think it \nwould be meaning sin but that is just a guess on my part.\n\nNow if you want to read about what some think to be a sauropod dinosaur in \nthe Bible look up Job 40:15, while some translations say its a hippo or \nelephant it couldn't have been because they don't fit the description of \nwhat is being described by God to Job.

If old earthers are \nright then the bible must be wrong about this because we find evidence of \ndeath, disease and thorns in fossils which are claimed to predate humans. \nPat seems to think that rock layers and dino bones prove an old earth, a \nfew google searches would help him to understand the YEC position \nconcerning rock layers and dino bones. Young earthers don't just ignore \nthese evidences as Pat here seems to claim, if they just ignored them and \nonly appealed to the bible as argument for creationism then yes, young \nearth creationism would be a joke, but in fact young earth creationists \nwrite extensively about these exact subjects in a rational and logical way. \nBut clearly he's already convinced that the YEC position is untrue, and he \nisn't even open minded enough to do a little digging and learn why young \nearthers are not convinced by these realities, instead he just assumes that \nyoung earthers must just be stupid or willfully ignorant to not be \nconvinced by rock layers and dino bones. Pat appeals to these objections as \nif he believes that young earthers simply have no answers for rock layers \nand dino bones. If young earth creationists really just ignore these \nrealities and have no answers for them, then tell me why young earthers \nhave published countless books, articles and videos on these exact \nsubjects? Why doesn't Pat argue with the *actual answers* which the \nscientists at places like AIG and ICR give to those objections? Probably \nbecause he didn't bother enough to actually look and see if young earthers \ngive any answers to these objections. Is he unwilling to even search for \nanswers because he simply has no faith that good answers to these \nobjections could even exist? If young earthers only have bad answers to \nthese objections then by all means, bring up their bad answers and show us \nwhy they are wrong, but lets be honest, they DO give answers to those exact \nobjections. Hey Pat, watch a few episodes of Origins TV on flood geology \nand dinosaurs and read the relevant articles on these subjects at ICR, then \ntell me why you think Young Earth Creationism is a joke. I didn't see Ken \nappeal to Bishop Ussher or any of his calculations even once in his debate \nwith Bill Nye, where did he come up with that? Did you even watch the \ndebate at all Pat?

Genesis 1 clearly states that plants came first, then \nanimals, then man and woman together. Genesis 2 puts the order differently, \nfirst man, then plants, then animals, then woman. The stories are \nchronologically irreconcilable, but that's not a problem if you understand \nthat their meaning is not a literal history, but a theological explanation \nof God's supremacy and humanity's place in creation. \n\nI didn't intend to set up a straw man with my question about needing a \nliteral take on Genesis in order to be saved. It was an honest question \nbased on numerous comments wherein people condemn Robertson and others to \nhell for their interpretation of Genesis 1. I'm not an evangelical, so I \nwas honestly wondering why so many evangelicals believe that one's soul is \nput in jeopardy if they believe what science has discovered to be true. \n\nFinally in John 6 is not metaphorical. Jesus claims to be the bread come \ndown from heaven and insists that his flesh and blood must be consumed by \nanyone who desires eternal life. He reiterates the point three times \nwithout backing off the supposed metaphor or even altering it to sound less \ninsane. And yes, He gave us his body and blood at the Last Supper, thereby \nestablishing the Sacrament of Holy Eucharist. He wasn't saying in John 6, \n\"Come over here ant eat me now.\" Indeed, he continually speaks in the \nfuture tense, (ie. \"the bread that I will give\").\n\nIn addition to reiterating his point about being the bread come down from \nheaven and the need to consume Him for eternal life, he also uses a choice \nword for eating. In verse 56 Jesus goes from using the traditional word for \n\"eat\" to a word that better translates as \"gnaw\" the way an animal would \neat. (Perhaps the way a sheep would eat from a manger?). Finally Jesus \nmaintains, if not strengthens his adamance that He is the bread come down \nfrom heaven and we must consume His flesh and blood for eternal life, \ndespite the fact that this causes many of his disciples to leave. I don't \nbelieve their is a literary interpretation requirement to enter into \neternal life. Jesus was speaking plainly, without metaphor, and those who \ncouldn't accept it were allowed to leave. I imagine if it were simply a \nmetaphor He would have stopped them and explained the metaphor (as He did \nwith the parable of the sower). \n\nAnd yes, the flesh and blood he promised to give in John 6 were given as a \nsacrament at the last supper and on the cross the next day. And that \nSacarament, the source and summit of Christian life, is being celebrated at \nall times, all over the world by millions upon millions of believers who \nache with a supernatural hunger for the Bread of Life.

But then, \n*thinking* and seeking *truth* don't seem to be your strong suits.\n\nHere's what you're good at: Blind denial of scientific and historical \nresearch, cursing, outbursts of anger, slander, hypocrisy, hate-mongering, \ndodging, ad hominem, inhibiting your own integrity, pessimism, closed \nmindedness, lack of respect, believing your own press, believing unproven \nand biased assumptions without checking sources and then regurgitating them \nad nauseam, allowing fear of the unknown to permanently stunt your \nintellectual and spiritual development.\n\nDeny God and remain in ignorance at your own peril. This is the information \nage. Everything you need to know is literally right at your tips of your \nfingers and all that's stopping you is FEAR of the TRUTH because once you \nhave it, you'll be ridiculed just as you ridicule others now. You fear man \nbut, 'It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living \nGod.'

The Levitical and \nceremonial laws were for Israel not the church, Christ fulfilled all the \nrequirements of the Law, we are not under the Law anymore, the Law was \ngiven to show our sinfulness not as something that we could do ourselves. \nWe cannot keep the Law, hence the reason Christ came, to die as a \nsubstitution in our place. Isaiah 53:10 says that it pleased the Father to \ncrush him, for us, that means all of us. But if you'd prefer to accept \nGod's wrath on your own, so be it. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13udljpeymesns2h22psjoanoaxsfvny": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXOtRAxgNvT_4cKmG0cxUgg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OEM8sM5wLII/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIU/_ZZL65eMRW0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Robin Thomas", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T23:58:02.835Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXOtRAxgNvT_4cKmG0cxUgg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.27788999999999997, "formal_score": 28, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T23:58:02.835Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112469359307799554876", "textDisplay": "Science is the study of creation, science will however never prove GOD.

I'd love to hear your take on it, along with anyone \nelse's.\n \nOnce again, for clarity's sake: if believing the Bible is the perfect word \nof God is a requirement for the Christian faith, how can you justify \ncalling it a \"metaphor\" instead of taking it literally, as the term \n\"perfect\" would suggest?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc1BD_J6kAtP4_JVbVBVISw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "GordonofSeattle", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13evx2xktvre5i0k234gvbrhmu2jd1cl", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-11T06:20:28.047Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc1BD_J6kAtP4_JVbVBVISw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.083282000000000023, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-11T06:20:28.047Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0V57cMUhXbs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADY/T5IJGt7ojgg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109758993361289727087", "textDisplay": "What reasons?\nOur obsession with wealth?\nOur neglect of the poor and vulnerable?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh4T_kep0_vmZM609rYUwug", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "mabblers", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13evx2xktvre5i0k234gvbrhmu2jd1cl", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-11T06:16:39.339Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCh4T_kep0_vmZM609rYUwug"}, "sentiment_score": 0.31497599999999998, "formal_score": 98, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-11T06:16:39.339Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112043578415785464810", "textDisplay": "The coming judgement on the USA for so many reasons."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc1BD_J6kAtP4_JVbVBVISw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "GordonofSeattle", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13evx2xktvre5i0k234gvbrhmu2jd1cl", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-11T05:54:00.300Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc1BD_J6kAtP4_JVbVBVISw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.51479000000000008, "formal_score": 9, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-11T05:54:00.300Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0V57cMUhXbs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADY/T5IJGt7ojgg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109758993361289727087", "textDisplay": "+mabblers\nOh good!\n Than may I ask, as a Christian, what are you most concerned about in this \ncountry?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh4T_kep0_vmZM609rYUwug", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "mabblers", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13evx2xktvre5i0k234gvbrhmu2jd1cl", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-11T05:51:53.445Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCh4T_kep0_vmZM609rYUwug"}, "sentiment_score": -0.88930360000000008, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-11T05:51:53.445Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112043578415785464810", "textDisplay": "Of course three times by myself, and two or three by tapes."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc1BD_J6kAtP4_JVbVBVISw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "GordonofSeattle", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13evx2xktvre5i0k234gvbrhmu2jd1cl", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-11T05:49:47.976Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCc1BD_J6kAtP4_JVbVBVISw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.30391999999999997, "formal_score": 19, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-11T05:49:47.976Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0V57cMUhXbs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADY/T5IJGt7ojgg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109758993361289727087", "textDisplay": "+mabblers I know where you are getting your \"facts\" from\n\nps Have you actually read the whole bible?

You have explained nothing.\n\n\"I checked out your link and it says \"everything that has a beginning has a \ncause except God, who has no beginning thus doesn't need a cause.\" Here's \nthe obvious hole in that theory - man was created IN GOD'S IMAGE therefore \nman also must have no cause, thus needs no beginning. Snap son!\"\n\nSorry. My 'evolved from a common ape ancestor' brain doesn\u2019t follow the \nchemical outputs from your 'evolved from a common ape ancestor\u2019s' brain.  \nBeing made in God\u2019s image means man has no cause?  What?!!  What logic do \nyou use to arrive at that?  But God made us!  What does God\u2019s image have to \ndo with anything? Your monkey logic doesn\u2019t seem to add up!\n\n\"1.) Science doesn't know what happened before the Big Bang. It's okay to \nsay \"I don't know\" if you truly don't. It's better then making shit up like \nthe entirety of organized religion.\"\n\nTrue. Saying \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d is a great answer.  We don\u2019t know for sure \neither, but we have our beliefs just like you have yours.\n\n\"2.) Dinosaur DNA lasts for 65+ million years because of a thing called \nbone. Bones are made up of cells. Cells have DNA. Some cells disappear \nbecause of their structure, others remain, much like skyscrapers during \nhurricanes.\"\n\nIf you think you have just answered this problem by claiming that bones \nanswer this, better think a bit harder. Bones fossilize and everything in \nthem hardens to stone. DNA disintegrates, red blood cells dry out. \nLigaments harden. This is what happens normally, and this is what \nscientists assumed would be true of dinosaur bones as well since they \nthought they were so old. Now they find they were wrong!  Does that change \ntheir view on the age of the bones?  Nope. It makes them believe in \nscientific impossibilities. \u201cWell I\u2019ll be a monkey\u2019s uncle! Wha\u2019dya know!  \nDNA can last for 65 million years!\u201d  Their paradigm gives them faith to \nbelieve in any necessary miracle needed to prop it up and keep it from \nsinking.\n\n\"3.) Miller\u2013Urey experiment has proven that you can make organic matter \nfrom inorganic matter.\"\n\nBetter go back to science class here or at least check your facts. If that \nis what you were taught, they pulled a fast one on you, dude!\n\nIf you can answer these 15 loopholes in the evolutionary theory of \nabiogenesis, go for it: \nhttp://creation.com/loopholes-in-the-evolutionary-theory-of-the-origin-of-life-summary\n\n\"4.) Yes because if they(laws of nature that make earth habitable) weren't \nmiraculous, we wouldn't be here.\"\n\nPoint is, your worldview cannot explain these.  You just chalk it all up to \nchance. Real scientific!\n\n5.) The software that controls our body wrote itself over millions of years \nby random mistakes in the genome(Is that even possible? How would you know \nor test it?)\n\n\"Yes, it is possible. This is the same reason why you require a flu shot \nevery year - mutations.\"\n\nMeaningless statement of faith and nothing more! You are no different than \nus!\n\nTake a Microsoft Word program. You want to add a new feature to the \nprogram. Do you think random mistakes added to the program over time would \nget you a new function?  Really?\n\nDo you really think you could take a computer program that controls the \nprocess of asexual reproduction and introduce random mistakes into it and \nsomehow come up with a program that enables sexual reproduction over \nmillions of year?  You cannot show this to be true. Bacteria evolve and \nvirus\u2019 evolve, but viruses aren\u2019t even living things.  The normally go from \ngood to bad! That\u2019s not the kind of change you need to show evolution to be \npossible. No one is arguing that changes don\u2019t take place. They do. Almost \nall are negative changes, loss of function, or slightly negative or neutral \nchanges that in and of themselves have no measurable effect, but which \npiled up over time will overrun the genome and cause massive failure. So \nyou admit that you think the software that controls your body is the \nproduct of chance!  Amazing faith!\n\n\"6.) See #3.\"\n\nNo explanation. The origin of life is a huge unsolved piece of the puzzle, \ndespite your great faith and wishful thinking.\n\n\"7.) It has to be.\"\n\nWell there you go then. That's settled isn't it?!  NOT!\n\nWonderful scientific statement!  Now I\u2019m even convinced!\n\nBut seriously, can you tell us how sex evolved? Imagine evolving \nsimultaneously and in the same area of the globe, a complementary male and \nfemale sexual reproductive system. What good would a half formed system do? \nWhat if the male system worked by the female system was not yet completed?  \nKey word here being SYSTEM!  We\u2019re not talking individual parts. And you \ncan\u2019t take a bunch of individually evolved parts and all of a sudden put \nthem together to get a completed system. They have to grow together from \nthe start! New genes are necessary to code for new functions and organs. \nAnd all this happened little by little? Male system matching the female \nsystem? The male and female system just happened to match each other, just \nhappened to evolve together and be finished together in the same location \nof the world!  Sorry, but dude, you are A MAN OF FAITH!\n\n\"8.) Because I wasn't brainwashed and forced to read the bible at an early \nage?\"\n\nNo, but you have been brainwashed by the secular faith story of naturalism \nand evolution.\n\nYou know, I don\u2019t think you even know the philosophical implications of \nsaying \u201cTruth evolved.\u201d\n\n\"9.) Again, it wasn't an accident. The right chemicals were at the right \nplace at the right time.\"\n \nRight!  How do you know this?  This is simply what you believe?  Can\u2019t you \nunderstand that man? This is your faith!  Get used to it. I know it\u2019s tough \nto admit, but say it with me \u201cI have faith!\u201d  There you go. You\u2019ll get used \nto it after a while! Take an aspirin and you\u2019ll feel better tomorrow!\n\n\"10.) And this is so much harder to believe as opposed to \"yah so a random \nguy was ALWAYS sitting there, got bored, and created man in his image, \nwhich doesn't really follow his image at all and he has never ever shown \nhimself, just required blind faith and obedience.\" Hell, outside of the \nbible, there's actually no proof of God. There's no proof of Jesus either. \nHell Christianity plagiarized some less popular religion from the nearby \narea. It was invented to control people by the Romans - stupid low IQ \npeople. It got out of hand. Here we are today.\"\n \ufeff\nWhich makes more sense? An almighty all wise supernatural person used His \nwisdom and power to create the universe, establish and uphold the physical \nlaws that allow life to exist, and create all of life and man in His own \nimage?\nOr, everything came from nothing. Brainless purposeless inorganic chemicals \nsomehow came together to form life in spite of all the impossibilities \ninvolved in this process, and then all of life evolved through random \ncopying errors!\nBoth are positions of faith, but one gives sufficient cause and the other \nis just wishful thinking! \n \nOh, and God has shown himself. He shows Himself in nature, through His \nrevealed Word, and most clearly in Jesus Himself, but also in the lives of \nChristians who have had their lives impacted by their relationship with \nHim. I know that is hard for you to understand since you have never \nexperienced a relationship with God, but whatever.

That is different than real science that uses the \nexperimental method?  Have you done an experiment to show that, contrary to \nexperience, life can evolve from non-life? Have you repeated this over and \nover again and shown it to be a true scientific theory as opposed to a \nhypothesis? Show us the experimental evidence if this is science as you \nclaim!

Even an atheist with an evolved monkey brain should be able \nto grasp it - which actually is evidence that your brain is not a product \nof random forces of mutations and natural selection.\n\nBut if you've got enough faith to believe that the most complex, \nsophisticated, computer program(complete with trillions of synapses, nerve \ncells, communication system, etc.) that controls the most complicated and \namazing robot on the planet could be a product of random mutations - each \none providing just a small benefit to the organism - hey, be my guest. \nBelieve whatever you want to!\n\nRandom evolutionary forces can produce whatever is needed whenever it is \nneeded one little random mutation at a time.  Makes for a great bedtime \nstory.

I would look closely to verses 24 and 25. I copied them \nbelow in context.\n\n2Ti 2:22  Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, \ncharity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. \n2Ti 2:23  But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do \ngender strifes. \n2Ti 2:24  And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto \nall men, apt to teach, patient, \n2Ti 2:25  In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God \nperadventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; \n2Ti 2:26  And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the \ndevil, who are taken captive by him at his will. \n\nGod was able to use Jonah's approach, but it was not the approach that God \nwanted Jonah to take.  People are lost and doomed for Hell if they do not \nrepent. We do not need to be angry with them. We need to lovingly share the \ngood news that someone shared with us when we are heading to Hell before \ndeclaring Jesus as Lord and believing in His resurrection.\n\nRuss Collins, truth does not depend on our belief. What is true is true \nwithout regard to our belief. I pray your anger will someday turn to an \nhonest desire to know the truth even if the truth does not fit our current \nworld view. The Bible says that without faith it is impossible to please \nGod. He rewards those that believe that he is and diligently seek Him.  The \nhostility and anger that you show lead me to believe that down deep, you \nknow that there is a God but do not want to be accountable to Him.

There has to be an assumption that the rock came into \nexistence containing parent elements, but no daughter elements.

It must \nalso be assumed that the rate of decay has always remained constant. Since \nno one was sitting around 500 million years ago to test rocks around the \nglobe to verify that they always form without daughter elements, (something \nthat is not necessarily true today,) nor was there someone collecting \nrocks, inserting them into super-duper hermetically sealed bags to prevent \nleaching out of or infiltration in of elements, nor anyone to keep \nconstantly monitoring the decay rates of radioactive material it seems \nquite obvious that these tests have only one beneficial use - they can be \nused by \"Old Earth\" believers and teachers of evolution to try to persuade \nothers that the world IS billions of years old and therefore plenty of time \nhas passed to allow for evolution to have occurred.

Potassium 40 has a half life of 1.25 billion years in a \nclosed system. Assuming there was no argon 40 in the rocks when they \nformed, radiometric dating would still yield unreliable results. There \nwould not be enough of the daughter element in the rock to accurately \nmeasure the ratio between the parent and daughter elements. This would be \nlike using carbon-14 (which has a half-life of 5.730 years) to date \nsomething that was formed just 2 hours ago.\nNot to mention, with fairly quick research, I've already found other errors \neither resulting from negligence or deliberate deception in this article \nand the sources of this article.\nThe samples from Mount Ngauruhoe were sent to Geochron Laboratories in \nCambridge, MA. I can't find who sent them or when because every search \nengine is so polluted with creationist propaganda that consistently fail to \nprovide that information. If you can figure it out, free feel to present it \nhere. Nevertheless, I have found articles of a similar nature by Steven \nAustin, a creation \"scientist\" that collected and sent samples of a known \nage from Mt Saint Helens to the same laboratory and received similarly \nerroneous results. However, not only did the researchers at this laboratory \nlack the proper, more precise equipment to accurately measure the ratio \nbetween potassium 40 and argon 40 for relatively young samples, but they \nspecifically noted that they could not accurately date any samples with an \nage of less than 2 million years.

Yet nobody \never can cite anything hateful he's said because such accusations are lies! \n Truem he does oppose homosexual behavior, but he's NEVER actually \ndemonstrated or encouraged hate. (If anything, he encourages treating \nhomosexuals decently as all other humans).  Finally, Mr. Robertson also \naccepts the evidence of global warming, as well as supporting the \nde-criminalization of marijuana.

You say I am wrong, so provide evidence refuting my argument.\n4.

I have asked you 3 times now, & you havent \npresented even 1 single solitary Bible verse.\n\nI mean, are my simple instructions too confusing for you?  Ok fine, I'll do \nyour work for you.\n\nYou are attempting the same repeatedly debunked 7 day creation argument \nfrom Genesis 1. Not only that, but a very bizare one. You appear to be \nclaiming that Jesus was part of the Genesis 1 account, which I have not \nseen in any Biblical translation, & I have seen MANY.\n\nOne thing to remember is that as always when you read the Bible, you have \nto consider whether what you are reading is a literal accounting of events, \nan allegory, or or metaphor. Because there are many segments that are \nspecifically metaphor & allegory but are read as literal. The Genesis 1 \naccount is actually allegory.\n\nSo the 1st area to tackle is the language part. As we all know, Genesis was \nwritten, like all the Torah books in Hebrew. The Hebrew language has less \nthan 9000 words & most are multi purpose words. The word for all \nmeasurements of time is YOM. That means second, minute, hour, day, week, \nmonths, year, decade, century, millenia, age, all are YOM. In fact, time \nit'self is YOM. Therefore based on the language alone, we cannot logically \nassume that YOM meant Day in Genesis 1 any more than we could any other \nmeasurement of time. in fact given current scientific knowledge, it is more \nlogical to assume it meant AGE of indeterminate length, not day.\n\nin fact, there are even Biblical scriptures that contradict the notion of a \nyoung earth. Just a small example:\n\nHear O mountains\u2026you everlasting foundations of the earth (Micah 6:2). The \nancient mountains crumbled, and the age-old hills collapsed (Habakkuk 3:6).\n\nHow ancient could those mountains be viewed as ancient if the earth was \nstill only a few thousand years old?\n\nSo, then moving on to the next young earthers trick in their tool box. they \nargue that they know they were 24 hour days because at the end of each day \nthere was evening, then morning. Well if that is the case, then tell me, \nsince there was no evening & morning after the 7th day, does that mean that \nthe earth is in fact not even 6000 years old but only 7 days old? That time \nitself suddenly screeched to a halt & we are all still in the 7th 24 hour \nday? Well we must be since it never ended. So as we can see here, that \nargument does not hold weight either because the 7th day defies the evening \n/ morning theory.\n\nSo, with the argument you provided, (well I provided for you, due to your \nlack of ability), The Genesis 1 Young earth theory falls flat.\n\nAlso, You might want to ask yourself why you cling so tenaciously to this \nyoung earth nonsense. It's like you believe that by letting go of a MAN \nMADE notion, you are somehow being anti-Christian or anti-Biblical, which \nis just insane. The Scripture isn't changing,  nor is there anything saying \nthat scripture is wrong. As our understanding of not only Science, but also \nof ancient cultures grows & evolves, we have to re-evaluate how we \ntranslate the Bible to better understand it. & by acknowledging that the \nuse of the word day in Genesis 1 may have been a miss-translation, it then \nallows for The Bible to withhold it's integrity without butting heads with \nscientific fact.\n\nSo you can sit there all you want in your self righteousness & think to \nyourself how wise you are for your steadfastness in remaining latched to \nyour own man made interpretation of the Bible against both scientific & \nBiblical fact, & how foolish we are for foolishly seeking knowledge & using \nnonsense like facts & logic, & nonsense like actually factoring in time, \nlanguage, culture & context into how we interpret the Bible, But you should \nalso know, that that mindset is also commonly called psychosis & delusion."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg_QjmXXvdoyVM_5WyJYuJw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "paul treick", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12rsryzroudcjiwy04cinqbnx3zxxkyitk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-13T23:09:23.379Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCg_QjmXXvdoyVM_5WyJYuJw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.42829, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-13T23:09:23.379Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115177852594469487181", "textDisplay": "The oldest trick in the Book(Did God really say???)is growing very very \ntired!!Please do you have anything that is a little more current than the \noldest trick in the book??"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGt_DUN8Jnkmaoea7yYTRPg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Matt Bates", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12rsryzroudcjiwy04cinqbnx3zxxkyitk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-13T23:02:59.551Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGt_DUN8Jnkmaoea7yYTRPg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.42521399999999998, "formal_score": 67, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-13T23:02:59.551Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4XZxwea9Vrc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA24/hsBjvr55FYM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108607072625304307882", "textDisplay": "+paul treick Versus the calculations of a collection of independent \nwritings, written a few thousand years ago, collected from various \nlocations by a host of people, bundled together by the Catholic church, \ntranslated into Latin, altered by the protestants, retranslated into \nEnglish, and then viewed as the unaltered and full word of God."}}]}, "z12dixer3rixzfysr23khlqjpkmtj1yig04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwt2uHhIhTw71vJUW3coJnA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "aprattvt", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-03-01T11:02:54.432Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwt2uHhIhTw71vJUW3coJnA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.50854599999999994, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-03-01T11:02:54.432Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108140435068740499032", "textDisplay": "U religious people are freaks.

That is... life just \n\"popped into existence\" from nowhere, from nothing, from no-\"when\".  That \nsounds a lot like \"The Big Bang\"!  \n\nDid you ever stop and realize, these scientific theories depict basically \nwhat is in the Bible as to the origin of everything?  Gen 1:1 \"In the \n[beginning] God created the [heavens] and the [earth].

You can't have Space or Matter without Time.  You can't have \nMatter without Space., So they are created In the correct order \nscientifically, as they are all co-dependent to exist, one built on the \nother.\n\nThen, as much as millions or even billions of years after the creation of \nthe universe & the earth, THEN mankind as we know it was created.  The \nBible gives an unlimited birth before life was created; NOT 6K Years.  FYI- \nThe Bible does not say the universe is 6K years old. The 6K years was \narrived at by adding up the linage of man recorded in the Bible from Adam. \n However, the Bible only records the blood line of Jesus Clearly, according \nto the Bible Christ, Adam & Eve were not the first creations of life God \nmade (take a look at what is described to live in heaven), according to the \nBible (not me).  Life other than mankind as we know it today inhabited the \nearth.  Gen 1:28 (KJV)  And God blessed them (mankind), and God said unto \nthem, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.  \"REPLENISH\" \nH4390 \u05de\u05dc\u05d0 \u05de\u05dc\u05d0  We may well have not been the first human like figure on the \nearth according to the Bible; explaining perfectly all the fossils being \nfound that are currently being incorrectly ties to evolution as supposed \nevidence of kind to kind progression..  The time between the creation of \nthe universe and the creation of man is not recorded ANYWHERE in the Bible. \n The universe could be Trillions, or more years old as far as the Bible is \nconcerned.  I'm so glad to see a public person such as Pat Robertson \nspeaking out as such.\n\nGen 1:1 In the beginning (TIME) God created the heaven (SPACE) and the \nearth (MATTER).

You're wrong on so many \npoints, but I'll try to make it short, if possible. You don't know me, but \nbecause you disagree, and because you hate a god who doesn't even exist, \nyou call me an idiot - illogical! As a retired Electrical Engineer, I know \nscience, physics, and math, but I also walk and believe by faith; they're \nNOT mutually exclusive. You can't know that I follow faith blindly, I \nquestion everything, yet you blindly and illogically follow your unbelief, \nbecause you have no evidence that there is no God, but act like it's \nproven, and that you know better. But your \"belief\" is necessarily \"by \nfaith\" - you have no evidence!When it comes to Creation of the Universe, \narriving at what we have today is impossible via chance alone; it requires \na Designer. Chance, or Evolution, cannot produce even one cell (not simple \nas once thought, but with 100,000 chemical reactions going on), let alone \nmillions of unique living things, with complex organs, and incredible \nmolecular machines, without which we couldn't even exist for more than \nseconds.Re childishness, God requires becoming as a little child. Man \ndidn't create God, but God created man as His crowning achievement, and \nyou're worth so much more than you think. God thinks so, and he gave his \nonly begotten Son, on your behalf. You need only believe, and you'll be \nsaved for all Eternity!I'm not blind, I've gathered and weighed the \nevidence, and I've come to rational conclusions based on both evidence and \nfaith. You can do the same, and God will welcome you.

They were often in the witness of large \ncrowds of people (some who walked for days just to listen) as first hand \nexperience with anything is the best way a fact can be replicated forward \nto others.  \"True\" story telling was the only detailed method of 2K+ years \nago to educate the globe of the revelations He reviled for current & future \ngenerations.\n\nHAVE YOU CONSIDERED THIS?\nHow could it have realistically; that is with the limitations of the time, \nbeen done any better?  In other words, if \"you\" were God of everything, how \nwould you prove yourself to mankind and offer a solution to mankind's \nissues with your relationship with them and then step away to allow them to \nsee if and how they would intact your plan of a desire for their happiness \nto be fulfilled; for the inhabitants of Earth to enact your plan? \n\nWHERE IS THIS IN THE BIBLE?\nMankind has this false, almost need like, of a belief that God has limited \nHis creation of life to man & planet Earth.  Wake Up!  Look as the life \nthat was created in Heaven, all apparently with free will\n\nWe forget that this Earth was, \"according to the Bible\" inhabited by other \ncreations of God before man was made \"in the image of God\".  You said you \nread the Bible, do you know where it says that?  Most people don't so don't \nfeel intimidated by it. My point is, once again  I believe Science will \ncontinue to ultimately harmonize with the Bible as man perfects our \nknowledge bank.  That's what has happened so far, but most people refuse to \nconsider it because they see God and Science as two opposing realities. \n This took place back in 15-1600 with the early discoveries of the planets; \nwhere the church should have opened the door to this type of investigative \nunderstanding, they feared the would lose their power over the people. \n They were and still are corrupted in many instances, not God.\n\nAt one time having a bic lighter to start a fire would have been considered \na miracle because science did not yet understand it.  Now it does.  If God \ncreated the universe, don't you think He also created the mechanisms of the \nscience we are continually discovering?\n\nOur understanding of proving a fact forward, is part of the reason I think \nit's ignorant to come out blazing with the whole \"There is No God\" \nideology.  Not only is it a claim that has no scientific backing; in my \nexperiences it \"always\" comes from a person with some type of grudge; who \nhas never \"honestly' considered the evidence supporting God.

Let's hear it you hypocrite. You fool. You putrid \ndisplay of the iniquities of sinful abomination. You charlatan. You fraud, \nparading around as a false Christian so as to make a mockery of Christians \nas bigoted, brain dead hypocrites, you who serve your true master Satan as \nyou make a mockery of Christians, pushing those who seek truth away from \nfrom the truth of Jesus.\n\nNow, If I can get real here for a moment, Obviously I am hamming it up with \nhow I am addressing you, but you do need to stop & seriously take a good \nlook at yourself & seriously consider a few things.\n\n1. As Christians, we are saved by grace & no longer under Levitical law. So \nyou going around & judging people based on Levitical law is actually \nblasphemy. Not only that, but you have no authority to judge. Only God does.\n\n2. If you insist on trying to force Christians back under the yoke of \nLevitical law, not only are you undermining the sacrifice Jesus made for \nall humanity, which is actually a slap in the face against Jesus, (meaning \nsomething that Christians ought not do), but in judging others by the law \nyou put yourself under the judgement of the Law too. This is bad for you, \nbecause even if the issue of homosexuality wasn't under debate, in your \nprofile pic alone, you violate 2 Levitical laws. You are wearing mixed \nfabrics & you cut your hair & shave your face. These are equally forbidden \nunder Levitical law as idolatry, (what you misrepresent as homosexuality), \nis. & if you eat pork, or shellfish, or rare meat, or have multiple crops \nin the same field, These are all additional violations. Therefore you not \nonly place yourself under VERY severe judgement, but you also commit the \nadded sin of hypocrisy.\n\n3. I & others here have used Biblical scripture to argue that Homosexuality \nitself is not a sin. I have already laid out a very detailed case, backed \nby facts & Biblical scripture stating that All instances of homosexuality \nin the Bible are deemed as sin due to homosexuality being used in idolatry. \n& since idolatry is the sin, which is not part of modern day homosexuality, \nthere is no justification for homosexuality being a sin. If you want to \nkeep arguing that it is, you 1st need to prove The Bible says that \nhomosexuality is wrong in & of itself, even if idolatry is not involved.\n\nSo The question I want to ask you is how do you justify judging homosexuals \nunder Levitical law, which is a form of blasphemy, heresy & false witness \nby the way, How do you justify judging them for breaking ONE law, when in \nyour profile pic alone you break TWO, & you likely break as many as FOUR \nmore in your normal day to day life?\n\nNow I would be very interested to see your answer, however I doubt that you \nwill man up enough to answer it. No offense, but typically in my \nexperience, homophobic hillbilly type rednecks who make the kind of \ncomments you do don't have the conviction of character, nor the honestly \nwith themselves or others to actually rise to the task of facing such \nhypocrisy & ignorance. When forced to face their inequities, & their \nignorance & let's face it, their lies, they run away so they don't have to \nface it & go spread their blasphemy & false witness elsewhere until someone \nelse calls them out. To be honest, I'm pretty certain you aren't even \nbothering to read this right now, because if it can't be wrapped up in a \nnice neat Fox News like sound bite, your type usually gets bored & stops \npaying attention, which is incredibly sad.\n\nSo, care to prove me wrong? or will your silence & evasion of the issue \nprove me right about your kind once again?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9YLQGop2EJh6EF2oclZSOA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "xSlappykinkaidx", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13bjjqxklm5jfh3k22zxt1gckbuefeea", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-20T07:29:41.233Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9YLQGop2EJh6EF2oclZSOA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.074546000000000001, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-20T07:29:41.233Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107997364393084699991", "textDisplay": "+Kelly Medley Tell you what, I'll make it super short & simple for you, \nbecause I know that too many words makes your head hurt. I know your used \nto your Fox News 2 word culture sound bite delivery.\n\nThe Bible does not say homosexuality is wrong. The Bible says the idolotry \nof homosexuality is wrong because in Biblical times, homosexuality was only \npracticed in idol worship. If you want proof, I included it in the other \nresponse to you I posted. You know, the long one with all the words.\n\n& like I pointed out a ton already, but you keep failing to answer for is \nyour picture. That hat you're wearing is either Wool or Beaver skin, & that \nt-shirt is cotton. & that jacket I am certain is a blend of other fabrics. \nSo how do you justify wearing mixed fabrics when you KNOW that is a \nviolation of Levitical law & equally as bad as homosexuality it? I also bet \nyou eat pork products like ham, bacon, pepperoni, pork chops, sausage, \netc.. Course you do. You're a cowboy after all, that is a staple in the \ncowboy diet. THAT is an abomination in Levitical law. Do you eat Shellfish \nlike Lobster? Crab? Shrimp? Crawfish? Oysters? clams? guess what, THAT ALSO \nis an abomination. Got a field you're farmin out there cowboy? How many \ncrops you have in that field? If its more than 2, ONCE AGAIN you have \ncommitted an abomination. I can tell from your pic you cut your hair & \nshave your face. Those too are abominations.\n\nThat means you already are guilty of the sins of wearing mixed fabrics & \ncutting your hair & shaving your face, which means, based on Levitical Law, \nyou are twice the sinful abomination that homosexuals are. & I bet you eat \nthose unclean animals. making your sin even worse, Do you eat your steak \nrare? Guess what? it is a sin to consume the life blood of the meat you eat.\n\nSo tell me, what is your justification for being such a sinful abomination \nin the eyes of Levitical law, while showing such hypocrisy in judging those \nwho are homosexual? Or do you in your foolishness think that the only part \nof the law is the part that doesn't apply to you?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYiC8VhwKt-1oCx7lRKKPcw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kelly Medley", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13bjjqxklm5jfh3k22zxt1gckbuefeea", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-20T06:44:09.128Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYiC8VhwKt-1oCx7lRKKPcw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.92282380000000008, "formal_score": 90, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-20T06:44:09.128Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LF_jZfOn6fk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAfA/pFY8vXRJNfs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103598041623270581674", "textDisplay": "+xSlappykinkaidx You can try to justify your sins but it won't stand up in \nGods court, God has judged you an abomination."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9YLQGop2EJh6EF2oclZSOA", "inappropriate_score": 0.093896713615023469, "authorDisplayName": "xSlappykinkaidx", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13bjjqxklm5jfh3k22zxt1gckbuefeea", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-19T08:06:00.609Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9YLQGop2EJh6EF2oclZSOA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.35968, "formal_score": 34, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-19T08:06:00.609Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107997364393084699991", "textDisplay": "+Corey Richard Well I suppose that is what you get for doing your own \nthinking Corey. Actually I have about 16 Bibles, all different versions \ngoing from King James version to New American standard, to NIV, \nContemporary English version, etc... I also have numerous books by John \nShelby Spong, The cost of Discipleship By Dietrich Bonhoeffer & numerous \nother books. & I think most here would agree that in challenging you to \npresent your evidence, it actually shows that I was seeing how well YOU \nknew the Bible, because you are the one making the claim that the Bible \nsays homosexuality is wrong, so the burden of proof is on YOUR shoulders. \nEspecially since most gay bashers go by what their pastor tells them. Not \nwhat the Bible says.\n\n& as for informing you of what Romans 1 says, well bad news for you on that \none, because I already did. If you look at my responses to you, my \nexplanation is 2 responses back. Now I don't know if you just decided not \nto read it thinking, (like most people who ignore the facts), that if you \npretend hard enough that it really isn't there, then your delusion will \nbecome reality. Sorry to say, but you are wrong there.\n\nBut to give you the short answer, Paul is addressing idolatry there. Just \nlike all Bible verses about homosexuality are in reality addressing \nidolatry. Because back in those times, the only actual application for \nhomosexuality was in the form of sexual indulgences to fertility gods or in \nfertility rights to pagan gods. That was the exclusive reason for \nhomosexual activity, thereby making homosexuality in its very practice a \nform of idolatry, & Idolatry was the actual sin. In fact, if you go through \nevery single Biblical scripture, Idolatry is always addressed in those same \nscriptures as well.\n\nAlthough I don't know why I am wasting my time repeating myself. We both \nknow that you're just going to lie to yourself & convince yourself that I \nnever answered the question or that I said something else. Maybe you just \nare too invested in your narrative that being forced to face the fact that \nit may in reality not be Biblically sound is just too much for you to \nhandle. Maybe you just are so engrained in your narrative that you simply \ncannot mentally fathom the facts being presented to you, DESPITE the fact \nthat they are all Biblically sound. Maybe your real master is Satan & your \ngoal is to continue with your iniquities & false witness of bigotry so as \nto perpetuate a false image of Christianity & turn people away from God. Or \nmaybe you are just a kid who has been taught so much that the Bible says \none thing about homosexuality & when presented with conflicting evidence, \nyour indoctrination is throwing up mental roadblocks. I mean when you go on \nfor so long believing something, even with presented with facts to the \ncontrary, it is understandable that you would struggle with accepting them, \n(much like a husband who believes for decades that his wife is faithful & \nthen is presented with proof that she has been cheating on him for a long \ntime for example)."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9YLQGop2EJh6EF2oclZSOA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "xSlappykinkaidx", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13bjjqxklm5jfh3k22zxt1gckbuefeea", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-19T07:38:22.732Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9YLQGop2EJh6EF2oclZSOA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.74890400000000001, "formal_score": 54, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-19T07:38:22.732Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107997364393084699991", "textDisplay": "+YG0L0IC0S No I do not.

I \nhave to say, I find myself wondering why you chose such a paper thind straw \nman argument for your position. Do you just not know the Bible as well as \nyou claim?  I mean there are a lot of other verses that you could have \npicked that would have made a slightly stronger argument. I mean \"the first \nchapter of Romans\" has to be by far the most soft ball argument I have seen \nyet. You couldn't even specify the verses in that chapter. Just the chapter \nitself. This should give you pause to spend more time studying on what the \nBible actually says, rather than what you think it says.\n\nHaving said that, obviously you were referring to the 26th & 27th verses. & \njust like with Leviticus 18 & 22 as well as every other reference to \nhomosexuality in the Bible, you fail to observe that the focus of the \nentire chapter, (or in this case, verses 18 through the end of the chapter, \nas the 1st part is Paul talking about his wishes to visit Rome), is against \nidolotry & idol worship.\n\nConsider, Whom was the book of Romans written to? also consider what role \nhomosexuality played in culture. Were there committed monogamous same sex \nrelationships in that time? Biblical & cultural history actually tells us \nno, there wasn't. That means that if 2 men or 2 women were having sex, they \nwere doing so in worship of Aphrodite. So your argument is still unfounded.\n\nCare to pose a counter argument disputing mine? or perhaps try again with a \ndifferent bible verse?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB5e4SLp836YNK_GaKu4DjA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Top Gallant", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13bjjqxklm5jfh3k22zxt1gckbuefeea", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-15T18:07:54.726Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCB5e4SLp836YNK_GaKu4DjA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.088570000000000038, "formal_score": 85, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-15T18:07:54.726Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102519726614257765492", "textDisplay": "+Goober Fries  the curriculum is totally anti-God, anti-nationalism, \nanti-individualism, anti U.S sovereignty.

This is a non-issue and has no bearing on \nChristian doctrine. There are excellent Christian teachers who believe that \nthe earth is older than 6,000 years (10 million, 10 billion, and such.), \nbut don't refute that God created it all. My question to people who believe \nin evolution is; If you think what Christians believe about Creationism is \na joke and fantasy then why are you even wasting your time debating and \ntrying to disprove it? You might as well debate people who believe in space \naliens or feng shui! Just wave it off with your hand and go about your day. \nThe real reason you debate creationism is because your conscience is \npricked. God created every single person that walked on this planet, and \njust because you choose not to believe in God does not make Him not real. \nThe God-given created conscience that everyone of us has cries out to Him. \nIt's why human beings don't behave like crocodiles or sharks, and when one \nof us does act so, we have police, laws, courts, and a justice system - and \nhopefully a moral conscience!. It's also why we have charities, celebrate \nbirth, mourn death, go to plays, go to school, go to work, have pets, have \nlibraries, fly to the moon, split atoms, and feed and take care of our \nfamilies and look out for neighbors we don't even know - we are different \nthan an amoeba, a fish or a chimpanzee.

I might even talk with my \npastor about this because this topic in general has been on my mind for \nmonths. \n\nRecently as you probably know Arizona tried passing a law that gave \nChristian businesses the right not to serve homosexual people. And two days \nago I checked out a gay couple where I work at a clothing store. In fact \nthey were the nicest people and we're very happy to see that I didn't look \nat them any differently than any other couple in fact we shared laughs and \nI complimented one of them. I asked myself why would God make a law against \npeople like the ones I checked out. Who were so so nice. Maybe if we didn't \npush those people away they would come to know God and accept him in their \nhearts but nooooo instead Some Christians spill hate and continue to give \nChristianity the villain role. It's time we accept everyone for who they're \nand stop leading people away. I\n\nI hopefully will find out for sure what God's true policy regarding \nhomosexyality is. Thanks for everything again.

Probably a combination of all 3. I will go over this one last time.\n\nYOU started this whole discussion with your ignorant comments saying that \nChristians are obviously stupid & wrong because their interpretation of the \nBible changes. I corrected you in pointing out that your bullshit was the \nEXACT same bullshit that Creationists say when they claim that Science is \nwrong & stupid because it always changes.\n\n& then you went off on some moronic \"DA Guvment passin laws that iz killin \nhumanity cuz of Bible falshoods & blah blah blah\"\n\nSo, just like I did in previous posts, Let's break down your idiotic \nnonsense & address it. \n\nYou said:\n\"God, you are such a troll slappy. The funny part about that, is your 2nd \nreply to me started off saying something about feeding trolls, as if I was \none.\" \n\nYour right. I should have known better than to get into a conversation with \na obvious troll / imbecile like yourself. I guess that was my bad.\n\nYou said:\n\"All I was doing was asking a question. You then get on this strawman, \nright/left-wing thing to somehow separate yourself from the nutjobs in your \nreligion that just help expose its hypocrisy,\"\n\nIncorrect. You made a bullshit, ignorant & incredibly douchebaggy straw man \nstatement, that statement being your Creationist straw man \"Science is \nwrong cuz it always changes\". Retrofitted to argue against Biblical \ninterpretation instead of science. I simply pointed out how your comment \nwas ignorant bullshit, & that you were an ignorant asshole for making it. \nIt was, in fact YOU who went off on some \"Da guvment passin laws killin \npeople cuz dey git dem frum da Bible, an Christians be teachin der kids dat \nGod cares more bout which team wins da super bowl an who dey crushin on den \npeople suffrin\" & all this other bullshit. Hence why I said that YOU went \noff into left filed, because it was YOU cramming all that bullshit in the \nargument. Not me.\n\nYou then say:\n\"all while trying to figure out new ways to stay relevant (the same point \nin my original post).\"\n\nLike I have already pointed out numerous times, YOU are shoehorning \nirrelevant shit into the discussion. Whether or not you believe the Bible \nis relevant to ANYTHING is totally irrelevant. Even if you believe that the \nBible is total bullshit does not change the fact that your original comment \nwas ignorant bullshit. & THAT is the ONLY relevant thing to this \nconversation. You acted like an asshole & said asshole bullshit. I pointed \nout how ignorant & douchebaggy your comments were.\n\nThen you said:\n\" Just accept your mortality already, it is liberating, trust me. Also, not \nonly is there absolutely zero non-biblical confirmation to the existence of \nGod, but also Jesus. None.\"\n\nAs for your mortality comment, When did I ever say I haven't accepted my \nmortality? Obviously you just assume that I haven't because in your \nminiscule brain, you assume that all Christians are the same, just like all \nbigots, (which yes, by the way, you are a anti-Christian bigot, which makes \nyou no better than homophobes, racists, etc...)  If God doesn't exist & \nthere is nothing after I die, then so what? It's not like I'm gonna be \naround to regret it or anything. Maybe you should stop assuming shit based \non your own narrow minded bigotry .\n\nAs for your claim that there is zero non Biblical confirmation of God's \nexistence, so? Whats your point? Who cares? That has nothing to do with the \nconversation. I find it funny that you keep claiming that I am the one \nchanging the topic & making all these arguments when YOUR OWN WORDS which \nare here for ALL to see, actually prove that YOU are the one throwing out \nall the idiotic bullshit. As I have already repeatedly said, Whether or not \nthere is proof that God exists has absolutely nothing to do with the fact \nthat your original statements, (& for the most part all your subsequent \nones), are complete idiotic bullshit.\n\nThen you said this which I have to admit, made me laugh & laugh:\n\"You should really inform yourself on world religions before you go \nclaiming that Christianity is some kind of original story (oh, and if you \ntry to go off on some tangent that I am bringing things out of left field, \nevery post on this video is about the (non)existence of God<- your implicit \nargument).\"\n\nFirst of all I actually have educated myself quite a bit about other world \nreligions. This is yet another example of how you just make bigoted \nassumptions of others based on your cookie cutter view of all Christians.\n\nAs for your comment about me claiming that Christianity is an original \nstory, 1st of all, I never made any claims for or against Christianity \nbeing original, primarily because IT IS IRRELEVANT TO THE CONVERSATION! The \nconversation is about how you made a bullshit ignorant Creationist straw \nman claim that you retrofitted with science & religion switching places. \nAnything aside from that is not only irrelevant, but was brought up by YOU.\n\n& this part: \"every post on this video is about the (non)existence of God<- \nyour implicit argument).\" NO IT ISN'T YOU FUCKING MORON! If you actually \nread what I typed, you would know that. Either A, you didn't even read, or \nB, your so fucking ignorant that you completely changed in your warped mind \nmy actual words to whatever you wished I was saying. Regardless, NO my \nargument is NOT about the existence of God. It's about how your bullshit \nremarks are bullshit. Maybe you should stop making assumptions based on \nyour clearly deranged imagination & stick to the details that are ACTUALLY \nrelevant to the discussion.\n\nThe bottom line, is your original post was ignorant, the same straw man \nbullshit creationists pull & was straight up bullshit, & everything you \nhave posted since is even more bullshit, & you are clearly a troll, an \nignorant asshole, or just fucking delusional & insane. Regardless of which \nit is, clearly having any kind of logic based conversation with you is an \nexercise in futility, because you cannot have a logical conversation with \nsomeone who has no grasp of logic to begin with. So I am ending this \nconversation now because I refuse to engage in a battle of wits with an \nun-armed opponent."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0GqsufQjJA5-p9Ukjlxqw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "YG0L0IC0S", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xfpqqcmjbdjkrd04cf1lrazf4izy4zv00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-21T22:41:48.935Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCN0GqsufQjJA5-p9Ukjlxqw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.45837599999999995, "formal_score": 30, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-21T22:41:48.935Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105437058017803949582", "textDisplay": "+xSlappykinkaidx God, you are such a troll slappy.

You went way off into left field in a lot of \nareas there. For one thing, I never took any college classes on how to \nargue. The fact that you make that assumption begs why you are attempting \nto turn this into an attack on me, (which by the way is a classic tactic of \nthose with a weak argument. Especially those who have so much of their \nmindset rooted in their argument that, when it is questioned, they lash out \nattack the opposition rather than have civil & respectful discourse about \nthe topic being discussed), & also what my educational pedigree has to do \nwith anything we are discussing? \n\nIn fact, most of your post has little to no relevance to what is being \ndiscussed. You made the claim that Christians who oppose young earth \ncreationism are stupid because their interpretation of the Bible changes. I \npointed out how your comment was ignorant & to put it bluntly, douchebaggy \nbecause, for 1 thing, it's rude & disrespectful, I mean just because you \ndisagree with Christianity does not make it acceptable to insult & attack \nChristians, just like it isn't acceptable for anyone to attack anyone else \njust because they disagree on something. & that's not \"Christian nonsense,\" \nThat's just basic common courtesy. I then also pointed out that it was \nhypocritical on your part because you were posing the exact same ignorant \nstraw man argument that Creationists pose when they say Science is stupid \nbecause it always changes. I then pointed out how for both science & \nBiblical interpretation, new info leads to re-evaluation & re-adjustment of \ntheories & beliefs. \n\nThat means this discussion was completely based on your rude, \ndisrespectful, ignorant & hypocritical behavior. \n\nThen you make this comment:\n\" Do you understand the danger in humanity making laws and values based in \nabsolute falsehoods? (Go research \"Glurge\" stories). Seriously Slappy, this \nis no different than making civilization believe that they should aspire to \nbe Santa Claus, and that one day they to will fly a sleigh around the globe \ndelivering presents to all the boys and girls of the world.\"\n\nOnce again, totally irrelevant to the discussion, but since you brought it \nup, What fucking \"dangerous laws & values based in falsehood\" are you \ntalking about? Don't lie? Don't murder? Don't steal other peoples shit? \nDon't bang your neighbors wife? Oh yeah, those are real threats to the \nfabric of society. The only law that is being pushed as far as I can tell \n\"in the name of religion\" is the opposition to gay marriage. & the anti \nhomosexual agenda, as you have to be aware by now, has already been \ndebunked repeatedly here as a non Christian, non Biblical myth. So what are \nthese \"dangerous falsehood based laws your blathering about?\"\n\nThen you make this comment:\n\"Now let me be clear, I get how RELIGION's myths, metaphors, and symbols \nhelp people to understand the world around them, but to socialize our \nchildren to believe in an anthropomorphic God who actually gives a bleep \nabout your desire to date the cute boy from 3rd period math class, that \nthis God cares more for the selfish individual on both superbowl teams more \nthan this loving God cares for the 6 year old girl who is abused by her \ndisgusting father is COMPLETELY WRONG\"\n\nAgain, I am forced to ask, what the fuck are you talking about? Where did \nyou pull this brain dead idea that God cares more about trivial minutia \nlike the fucking super bowl than he does about the legitimate suffering of \na abused child? There is nothing in the Bible that says anything like that, \nNor did I say anything like that, & on that last part, again, since I said \nnothing like that, Why the hell are you bringing it up here? Should I \ncounter your statement by feverently arguing how potato salad with eggs is \nbetter than traditional deli style? It's about as relevant as the shit your \nthrowing out.\n\n& by the way, yeah I agree. If parents are teaching their children that God \nreally does favor their football team of choice, then yeah, those parents \nare fucking up & are not good examples of what a Christian is.\n\n& then you post a link to a moronic pastor that died from a snake bite. \nREALLY? Your going to throw THAT in there? You know, I have probably been \nto well over 50 churches in my life, I tend to go through them pretty fast \nbecause once they start teaching principals that I know arent Biblical, I \nleave them. Not a single one of them have pranced around on stage fondling \nsnakes. Know why? BECAUSE THAT SHIT IS ONLY DONE BY A TINY BAT SHIT CRAZY \nMINORITY OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY! Most people, including most Christians \nknow that handling poisonous snakes is just fucking stupid. Just like the \nnotion of faith healing is also universally known as stupid.\n\nI can play that game too though. Let's see, Ayn Rand was an atheist & a \nconfirmed sociopath. I guess that means all atheists are sociopaths. So I \nguess that not believing in God is even more dangerous because doing so \nwould make me a sociopath. Do you see how stupid your straw man attack \ntactic of using the lunacy of a clearly insane minority to attack the whole \nclass of people is?\n\nThen you make this claim:\n\"What you fail to realize is, no matter how much biblical text you read, \nand new interpretations, they are still not from God because \nanthropomorphic God doesn't exist, and for god damn certain, \nanthropomorphic-monotheistic god does not exist. Therefore your premise \nbeing false, it necessarily follows that you will come to false \nconclusions. (Otherwise, GOD COME TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF INSTEAD OF ALL \nTHESE HUMANS, after all, you are God.)\"\n\nBoy you really do like the straw man arguments. I'm guessing your debate \ntactics basically consist of taking the same tactics young earth \ncreationists use & just reversing the roles to suit your narrative. Because \nthey are the only ones I know of that use straw man arguments as much as \nyou do.\n\nYou are shooting off your mouth with the assumption that you have proven \nthat God does not exist. This is the same logical fallacy straw man \nbullshit Creationists pull when they claim that intelligent design is proof \nthat God does exist. It's absurdly foolish when they do it & likewise it's \nabsurdly foolish when you do it.\n\nThe fact is, You cannot prove that God doesn't exist just like no one can \nprove that he does exist. So the rest of your argument is null & void \nbecause it relies on the premise that God not existing is a proven fact. \nYou BELIEVE that God does not exist, I believe that he does. But neither of \nus can actually prove his existence either way. \n\nBy the way, your interpretation of faith & belief is false. I advise you to \nconsult a dictionary.\n\n& your last claim:\n\"Lastly, the difference with belief in things changing with science is that \nscience is constantly looking and made no initial claim as to an absolute \nauthority of creation and everything that follows, including the afterlife. \nUnlike Monotheistic religions which all claim Absolute \nauthoritive-knowledge of God.\"\n\nAgain, incorrect. Some foolish parts of the minority make such absurd \nclaims, but the fact is, science dictates HOW the world & the universe came \nto be. All the Bible claims is WHO orchestrated it. In fact, most \nChristians who oppose the creationist dogma openly admit that they don't \nhave all the answers.\n\nA piece of advice, if you HAVE to respond to me again, at least take the \ntime to construct a post that is relevant to the discussion & is not bat \nshit crazy."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0GqsufQjJA5-p9Ukjlxqw", "inappropriate_score": 0.15444015444015444, "authorDisplayName": "YG0L0IC0S", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xfpqqcmjbdjkrd04cf1lrazf4izy4zv00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-19T05:35:00.909Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCN0GqsufQjJA5-p9Ukjlxqw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.099752000000000007, "formal_score": 85, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-19T05:35:00.909Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105437058017803949582", "textDisplay": "+xSlappykinkaidx Thank you for the lesson Slappy.

What does the Hebrew language \nhave to do with anything? Well it has a lot to do with debunking the \ncommonly believed myth that Genesis 1 is a literal 6 day record of the \ncreation of the world.

You \nmade the same lame brain mistake that Young Earth Creationists make when \nthey plug their ears & go \"LALALALALALALALALA I CANT HEAR YOU. SO AS LONG \nAS I KEEP MY EARS PLUGGED & KEEP GOING LALALALA I CAN PRETEND THAT YOU \nNEVER SAID WHAT I AM MAKING A DELIBERATE CHOICE TO BLOCK OUT & KEEP PUSHING \nAHEAD WITH MY NARRATIVE IGNORANT OF THE FACTS LALALALALALALALA!\"\n\nWhy do I say that you ask? Because I actually did answer your question numb \nnuts. You either chose to ignore it, or didn't even bother reading it in \nthe 1st place.\n\nLet's review your initial quote:\n\"I LOVE how this omnipotent, all-powerful, UNCHANGING God keeps changing to \ntry and make itself sound relevant, along with all of you followers that \nkeep changing what you believe. Are you all so far from reality that you \ndon't see why monotheistic religions are a complete FRAUD. How can you all \nkeep changing your stories about what your religion believes? I mean I \nunderstand that we as human can change our minds given new information, but \nhow does a god who inspired his word get it wrong??????\"\n\nNow let's look at my response from my original post:\n\"Now just to be thorough & cover all the bases, Just like scientific theory \nchanges in light of new evidence & new research, Archeologists & \ntheologists are also finding new data about ancient cultures, including \nBiblical cultures, that give us a better understanding of those cultures, \nwhat their customes were, how they lived, etc... & in light of those new \nfinds, those of us who actually give a fuck about being honest with \nourselves about our faith & really want to seek the truth re-evaluate \nBiblical scripture. Details matter just as much in theology as they do in \nscience. Some ofthe most critical details in theology is culture & customs \nof the time & place & author of the written scriptures.\n\nLet me simplify it for you. Just like new data leads to new & better \ninformed theories in science, Newly found data about ancient Biblical \nsocieties also leads to new & better informed theories about Biblical \nscripture. The same damn principal goes both ways dude.\"\n\nSo as you can see, I did answer your question, you either missed it, or \nchose to ignore it.\n\nYou see, With knowledge & understanding of things like the Hebrew language \nbeing more readily available to people, & with tools like the internet, we \nare able to access Non Biblical historical data about ancient civilizations \nwith ease. As archeologists continue to dig in the middle east,, & continue \nto find more information, That new information can be used to help us \nbetter understand life & times of that era.\n\nFor example, Because of the internet, Those who want to research the Hebrew \nlanguage can do so with a few simple google searches. However, even as \nrecent as 30 to 40 years ago, Hebrew was exclusive to those who either were \nraised Jewish & were taught Hebrew, or those who invested the time & money \ninto taking a college course on it.

In other words, \" how does an all-knowing, all-powerful, \nUNCHANGING God, get it wrong?\" He doesn't. Humankind's interpretation of \nwhat it THOUGHT was \"God's method\" was wrong. That is a reflection on the \nreaders & their interpretation, not on the misread material itself,\n\nYou also claim that my accusations against you were wrong. Well lets put \nthat to the test.\n\nyour version of a straw man argument is a straw man itself.  In its \nsimplest definition, it's the name of a logical fallacy, which means that \nif you carefully dissect the argument or statement, it doesn't make sense. \nDebaters invoke a straw man when they put forth an argument--usually \nsomething extreme or easy to argue against--that they know their opponent \ndoesn't support. You put forth a straw man because you know it will be easy \nfor you to knock down or discredit. It's a way of misrepresenting your \nopponent's position. \n\nCreationists make the straw man argument when they say that science is \nwrong because they \"Keep changing their story all the time\". We know it is \na straw man because when new scientific facts & new data surfaces, we \nre-evaluate & adjust scientific theories in light of that new data.\n\nTherefore when you claim that Christians are wrong & stupid like you did \nbecause their interpretation of the Bible changes, you make the exact same \nargument that Creationists make, only with science & religion swapping \nplaces. because both the Creationist straw man & your straw man all boil \ndown to the argument of \"Your stupid & wrong because your narrative \nchanges\". & we know that your straw man is wrong because, Just like with \nscience, as our understanding of history, especially history of Biblical \ncultures evolves, & new info becomes available, we re-evaluate our \ninterpretation of Biblical scripture in light of that new info.\n\nIf I were you, I would carefully consider what I have now told you TWICE \nbecause as an advocate for both the Christian & the scientific community, I \nam being a credit to both communities here. You on the other hand, really \nare only serving as a credit to the creationist community as behavioral \nammo against atheists an example to other atheists of how not to act.

They are plausible doctrines but are not \ninerrant.Both are doctrines that were thought up by someone. Genesis was \nwritten in a poetic form and in the original language, which is hebrew mind \nyou not english, the word for day is transliterated as \"yom\" with a long \n\"o.\" \"Yom\" is not confined to a 24 hour day, and since one of the \nfundamental beliefs in Christianity is that God is Transcendent (not bound \nby time) that it is not factual but it is plausible that the earth could be \nolder than 6,000-10,000 years. The first \"day\" it says \"the earth was \nformless and empty and darkness was over the surface of the deep and the \nspirit of God hovered over the waters. and God said 'let there be light' \nand there was light\u2026\" Genesis 1. it then goes on to say that God separated \nthe light from the darkness and called it day and night. there is no way to \ntell how long God hovered over the waters or how long the first day even \nwas. before the fall, there could have been a longer day. meaning instead \nof it only being 24 hours it could have been longer or shorter. therefore \nwe have no idea how long God took to make the earth. What we do know is \nthat God is sovereign and powerful enough to create (Hebrew \"Bara\") it 1 \nsecond, 6 days, or 100 million years. That's the entire point of it all. \nit's not that Young earth's are right, and Old earth's are wrong or vice \nversa, the point is that both are plausible and God is able enough to do \neither. It breaks me to see disunity over something that isn't even \nessential to salvation. the entire point of the Genesis account and the \nentire OT is the story of God putting his family back together through the \nMessiah, Christ Jesus. I know many people who have different beliefs in \ncreationism, eschatology, and theology of all kinds. there are many debates \nbetween calvinists and arminians pentecostals and open theists but the \npoint is that God is sovereign and in complete control of the earth and had \nthe will to create the earth in as much time as he wanted. disunity should \nnot happen over something so trivial as the differences between theologies \nand doctrine. as long as the core doctrine (that Jesus is the son of God \nand died for the sins of man and is the propitiation for our sin, that he \ndied on a cross and was resurrected and he ascended into heaven and is \ncoming back)  is sound it shouldn't matter how one believes about little \nthings. Those in Christ are all unified by His blood, not by the view of \nCreation, end-times, or any other theology. By His wounds, we are healed. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z133dn3abtzvxl3cp22eefjp3vqaepi4i04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZEH0mrIxBNXOAZazOc_iw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-IaSrMVayiSs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAF8/CiapBcJJiP8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ShikataGaNai100", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-05T21:52:53.310Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAZEH0mrIxBNXOAZazOc_iw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2014-02-05T21:52:53.310Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117477016546295993698", "textDisplay": "pwned\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13sd3m5wxmvgbzum22zcdogouq3ht45u04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWT3PmLte-5ijoP5RfcOvdA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "jephers29", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T13:39:40.742Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCWT3PmLte-5ijoP5RfcOvdA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.79444399999999993, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T13:39:40.742Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104434054500208151699", "textDisplay": "I don't know what to say... \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12aytjaeyqddhh4304cc10gqvbwg1a5eak": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClEe9tp-rnwUKI8B9z6sLlw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "fisher99100", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-09T16:22:46.153Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UClEe9tp-rnwUKI8B9z6sLlw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.21829800000000005, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-10-09T16:22:46.153Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114496803321432629052", "textDisplay": "pat robertson is wrong about this the earth is young kids in college are \nmaking oil out of meat in 30 minutes and pig farmer are using waste to make \ngas,pat is being bought off! creationist are right the world is young and \ncan be proven just by gravity the earth is losing it gravity to fast to be \nold.kent hovind creation series is the best he cover all carbon dating and \ngravity issues.even the universe proves it is young at godisjesuschrist,com\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYuDsZt7We4PipZQITbQtCA", "inappropriate_score": 2.4390243902439024, "authorDisplayName": "Douglas Kalles", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12aytjaeyqddhh4304cc10gqvbwg1a5eak", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-03T02:31:33.807Z", "likeCount": 8, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYuDsZt7We4PipZQITbQtCA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.34199399999999996, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-03T02:31:33.807Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UA6Ml_gijIA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOY/rW_76ZpRKFw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112709513304659904556", "textDisplay": "\"The Earth is losing it's gravity?\" What the fuck drugs are you on?

In Ex. 20:11, God Himself, wrote with His own finger on the \ntablets of stone that He created the heavens and the earth in 6 days. That \ntakes you from verse one through v. 31 in Genesis 1.

And declare the younger earth is far more in \nline with the science of their various fields, and that some big bang \nisn't? If you haven't read the creation scientists' documentation and \nexplanations, why not? ... What are you afraid of? Mr Robertson's mind has \nbeen deteriorating for some years since I first watched and trusted him and \nonly the Holy Spirit of God can reach him now, it looks like, so please \nplease please pray for GOD to tell you what His Word says and why millions \nof years is not consistent with GOD's own words. Death and destruction over \nmillions of years wouldn't be \"very good, for just one small example.\" ... \nGOD the Son ought to know, He was there and did it all, in 6 days like HE \nsays. No, it us not impossible for Him! Why would it? He's GOD. We're not. \nAnd we have no right at all to infer He is a liar or cannot create \neverything in six 24-hour days. Nor that He couldn't have always existed. \nThat is a god that YOU have made up in your mind which is limited by our \nhuman-ness. Trust GOD ONLY, the Creator of Science, the Way, the Truth, and \nthe Light ... again HIS own words.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHKCg_N0R0LO9mZL59fYPXw", "inappropriate_score": 2.4390243902439024, "authorDisplayName": "XDarkxSteel", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12rthza4rutclfps04cepobtvqyjlhgea4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-07T02:52:53.492Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHKCg_N0R0LO9mZL59fYPXw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.85187239999999997, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-02-07T02:52:53.492Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102998131108409034471", "textDisplay": "PleAsE STOP CAPITOLiZing RAnDOm WordS AnD LeTTeRS, ITS AnnOYIng As FuCk AND \nMaKeS You LoOk EVEN MoRe ReTArdED THAN YoU Are,"}}]}, "z134gddqtu20vjo3p23dc1vjmsypwp5vu": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 27, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr3MIOn4PTnLqFCBMv6RESQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CZ5f1yV0AQQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKY/SB-EaT47W-I/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dark Sunshine", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-02-10T06:21:55.094Z", "videoId": "MWAbr-SoMAs", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCr3MIOn4PTnLqFCBMv6RESQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.35946600000000001, "formal_score": 94, "updatedAt": "2014-02-10T06:21:55.094Z", "likeCount": 7, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113597319967366105346", "textDisplay": "At Last ...

Yes, well the reason isn't because of that \nperson themselves but rather because other people plant the idea into their \nheads that people hold the ultimate key to truth in all senses of the word. \nPeople are all knowing, they come up with the meaning of life. People are \nall powerful, they control the world. Right? Well, sorry but we wouldn't \nhave science if not for God. We wouldn't have minds if not for God. You \nhave had the understanding, whether or not you want to admit it or not, \nthat God exists since your earliest thoughts. Yet you choose to follow the \ninstruction of people rather than God because their promises are based on \nyour lust and your impatience.

You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what proof is. You \nCANNOT prove a claim by example; it is a logical fallacy. You CAN disprove \na claim by counterexample, however. These are simple rules of logic. For \nexample, say we make the claim that all apples are red. If, soon after, we \ncome across a red apple, this by no means proves that all apples are red, \nonly that the one that we found is red. But If I were to say that all \napples are red and then find a green apple, this DISPROVES the claim that \nall apples are red. In regard to the Bible... let me give you the benefit \nof the doubt and agree that the prophecies to which you refer have indeed \ncome true (I can't say that I know what you are referring to). These are \nonly examples, and they cannot prove that the entirety of the Bible is true \nand authentic just like one red apple cannot prove that all apples are red. \nAlso, they are events which could have come to pass with or without the \nBible prophesies having been written. The mere fact that these examples in \nthe Bible came to pass in the real world does not by any means prove the \nBible's authenticity. Examples do offer probabilistic proof. However, if we \nare going to go delve into probability, the amount of things in the book of \nGenesis that probabilistically could not have happened (usually with \nstatistical significance of 5%) FAR outweigh those that could have (if \nthere are any).\n\n2. How does me making the point that you cannot prove the word of God is \nauthentic make me \"love sin and hate good\"? Is it because I used logic to \nreach that conclusion rather than faith? I am not claiming that God does \nnot exist, nor am I claiming that he does. I simply claim that you cannot \nPROVE his word as written in the Bible is authentic (nor can you prove his \nexistence for that matter).

And just the same \nway everyone here has a difference of opinion as to what Pat Robertson \nmeant, the same holds true as concerning the bible. It has been \nmisinterpreted by many (including Christians). As far as how old the earth \nis? this comes to mind, \"A day is as a thousand years and a thousand years \nis as a day\" As far as the theory of evolution goes, if nothing existed \nbefore the \"big bang\" then I wonder what \"Banged\"?  I think something had \nto exist beforehand, thus something had to be created! In fact the \nonly \"theory\" that makes any sense at all is \"Creation\" by God! No offense \nto anyone who believes in evolution.  Most people in the world has to SEE \nto believe... But for Christians, believing is SEEING.  All the evidence I \nneed is living in my heart... If you don't believe in God and you think \nwe're all insane and diluted, then my question to you is this, why does \nour faith in God bother you?  What is the big deal?  There are so many \ndifferent types of belief systems out there, some believe in God, others \nbelieve they are their own god, and some believe in reincarnation etc...  \nHow does one persons faith in God threaten another persons particular \nbeliefs or their doubts about God.
