First of \nall, nobody is trying to \"prove\" this event happened or didn't happen \nbecause it's not up for debate. There are scores of real, live eyewitnesses \nwho were there and saw and heard the shooting happening. There are 26 \nfamilies (parents, spouses, children, siblings...etc) that lost a loved one \nin the shooting who are out and about in public, before AND after the \nshooting. There was an official investigation which yielded an official \npeer reviewed report , based on corroborated eyewitness testimony, actual, \nphysical, forensic and DNA evidence. Of course there are anomalies and \ninconsistencies after the fact, there are with every large scale event, but \nespecially with something of this scale, this gruesome and with absolutely \nno precedent. Human beings were witnessing and processing an event of \nunthinkable horror. If anything, anomalies and inconsistencies only serve \nto further validate the official story. Or should we talk about how it \nwould be completely impossible to pull off a scripted, fictitious scenario \nof this size and complexity, with so many moving parts, and god knows how \nmany men, women, children, organizations, agencies...etc that would have to \nbe involved and then, after nearly 3 years - every single one remains \nairtight and silent. REALLY?...oh, and for what? To pass a law? REALLY?..oh \nwait...they didn't pass a law anyway. And if the government would go to \nthat great length to close a loophole in pre existing policy illegally, \nthey could do it many other ways that would be far simpler and more \neffective. There is just nothing about the hoax theory that ever made any \nsense at all. And yet in light of absolute evidence to the contrary, there \nwill still be those (at least here in YouTubeland) who will desperately try \nto cling to their fantasy because pretending this horror never happened is \npreferred to accepting the reality that we live in a society where mass \nshootings can and do happen.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnZ_PvfSzHydbSrzcCmpSlw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Bigenash", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z120wfjyxxzohdl0g232ydcxdryhfbtyo04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-10T12:54:12.383Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnZ_PvfSzHydbSrzcCmpSlw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.61788599999999994, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-10T12:54:12.383Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112220000544568014093", "textDisplay": "+Trev Man Wow.

They merely state openly on the record what 10 of the \nmost important inalienable rights of the people are.  Does that make \nsense?  Being an 'amendment' doesn't 'create' the right:  The rights are \nmerely being recognized, not created.  The right was already in existence, \neven before the Constitution, but the founders included them to openly put \nthe government on notice that the People have rights, these first ten \namendments being the foremost, which the government owes it's sole \nexistence to protecting.  So, the right can neither be created or altered, \nnor is it created or altered, although the 'description' of it or listing \nof it may be subject to amendment.  Here I am only speaking on the first \nten amendments.  But there are other parts that are similar.

With the exception of the glass shards being blown into the room as \none of the commenters has pointed out, this video has absolutely zero value.\n     Additionally much of what this lady says is incorrect.  She harps on \nabout how, \"You cannot change a crime scene\", but then why does she think \nit was \"changed\"?  Oh, because the photos were different.  So I guess that \nmeans that there were some photos taken before it was \"changed\".  In other \nwords the scene was preserved using photographs!  Since photos are \nevidence, one might conclude that they preserved the scene by making a \nphotographic record.  In a certain sense, they froze it still, frozen in \ntime forever... that digital image, that number, does and always will \nFOREVER (You stupid God Damned Dip shits!) FOREVER, AND EVER, AND THEN \nFUCKING SOME MORE TIME.  YOU MIGHT SAY THAT CRIME SCENE WILL LAST FOR ALL \nOF ETERNITY MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS....  then, \nonce that was completed as best as humanly possible, then it was time to \nremove/ peal away the second layer, and third layer(s), etc. with each step \nalong the way being forever preserved in digital imagery.\n     Also look at the title of this bag-o-turds, and compare that to what \nyou actually get.  Anyway, I don't have anymore time for this \nfuck-head-festival.  Let me just quickly make one thing perfectly clear; \nright now, anybody who actually believes there is any logic or any valid \npoint being made by this video is a retard.  You would have to be a \ncertified mental retard for anyone to put any kind of actual weight to this \nvideo, and I have to say this:  If this woman actually believes this is \nlogical or has any value, then she is beyond any shadow of doubt a fucking \nimbecile - and I mean as a medical and clinical definition.  That is the \nlevel of departure from logic we have here.\n    Therefore since it is unlikely that a person so deficient in thought \nwould be capable of putting together and posting such a presentation, the \nactual truth here is that this video was made with the intent of deviding \nand confusing potential recruits to the Truther movement."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy_HdGIdTzmv4S8cDRX9B-Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheZyzzybalubah", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12vhftozwubth5sp23buzmogm2tj1ojt04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-23T16:30:26.056Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCy_HdGIdTzmv4S8cDRX9B-Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.74526399999999993, "formal_score": 30, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-23T16:30:26.056Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uzGN8DPg5sg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACM/STs2Bm2UPkg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110761902492278887797", "textDisplay": "You don't have to insult her for seeking answers.

No it would \nnot. During a fire or any other emergency evacuation all classes in all \nschools are evacuated out through the nearest doors. The same happened at \nSandy Hook.

If we don't \nquestion it, how does that pan out? \n\nSo, I'm not going to talk about sandy hook with you because you've been \nunreasonable and a dick and pretended that nothing is said made sense \nbecause you're so eaten up with contemp you can't see straight.

This is what \nyou do so you can hide a secret within the whole event. So no one knows \nabout it but very very few. \n\nThe DHS and FEMA and FBI and ATF etc all do extensive and realistic \nsimulations using real civilian actors called crisis actors. They help with \nbeing hostages and an angry crowd or injured for training exercises and are \nvery valuable to these. \n\nAll these agencies have exercises all over the country every day. Many are \nextensive enough to require weeks of rehearsal and training. I gave you a \nlink to DHS calendar of training exercises. It's not all classified but \nones that are news to be for the ostensible reason of making sure civilians \ndon't mistake the drill for a real circumstance and call police and media \netc and taint the drill. It also makes for the opportune time to perform a \npsyop or conspiracy. See the training event is scheduled way ahead of time \nand is a real training event 100% because those participating are just \ndoing the drill and are none the wiser. It's not gonna be the same agency \ndoing the psyops than the one doing the drill I'd even say. that gives \nplausible deniability to the innocent participants. \n\nSo when the event comes to a start, and the actors and local police who are \nworking with the agency go, they don't know if anything happens at all. The \nsituations are made to be as close to real as possible with media and \nwhatnot. At Sandy Hook, this is what happened. The actors were just doing \ntheir thing and performing their script as always. The psyops here was \ncutting the feed to the media, without the players knowing. So while the \nactors script had 20 children murdered, there were not actually even child \nactors for that, just active shooters and survivors inside the school. But \nmedia didn't know and in an instant, the country is in mourning over the \nloss of 20 children that never existed. They profile the guns used and \nreally drive home how dangerous they are and of course, dead kids. This \nemotional tug on the heart is the psyops meant to soften you up to gun \ncontrol legislation, which Obama was talking about within minutes. \n\nThat's how conspiracies work. It's actually so simple that it's \nembarrassing how easily we are duped. Look over here dead kids sadness, \ndon't look there where there's obviously screw ups that will make anyone \nquestion this farce is seen.\n\nBut you will not believe this. You may not believe our govt does this at \nall I don't know. The govt knows how naive the public is and uses that \nevery chance they get. \n\nAnd 26 people were invented. It's easy to do. That's the least of anyone's \nworries"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnZ_PvfSzHydbSrzcCmpSlw", "inappropriate_score": 0.1721170395869191, "authorDisplayName": "Bigenash", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ngv5bbxzhtpswg04cgft53paztpgzbuk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-03T16:46:10.585Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnZ_PvfSzHydbSrzcCmpSlw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.49714999999999998, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-03T16:46:35.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112220000544568014093", "textDisplay": "+Greg Williams Nobody is trying to \"prove\" this event happened or didn't \nhappen because it's not up for debate.

Or was it set up to look like the bomb blast that was \nonly capable to blasting off people cloths till days later when all those \nwho lost clothing supposedly had lost legs etc.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12wytjwho2rgvfis04cgx2rwwa0i30ou54": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7iVBK9GvLRr2rAdmb_sIfw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "anastasia2657", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-24T16:50:40.742Z", "videoId": "le50gJ2kbro", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7iVBK9GvLRr2rAdmb_sIfw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.49984600000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-04-24T16:50:40.742Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111746616421214186963", "textDisplay": "You will also notice that the interior door with the round window did not \nhave those decorations in the photos taken from outside the bldg.

My son has Aspergers and it may be. \nHe did say this is the worst he's seen, so if what you say is true, I'd \nhate to see how he talks when it's not dead children. My wife is a doctor \nof clinical psychology with specialty in children with ASD and learning \ndisorders. That doesn't make me an expert or her, but I'm more familiar. \nExperts seem to be anyone giving a TV interview... it seems, and they're \nwrong all the time. It's still opinion that I don't bow to. That's the \n\"appeal to authority\" argument. I'm no expert so I can't be right. It's not \na real solid argument in this case. If we're talking hard science than yes, \nI could see. He also doesn't have a clue how many bodies he saw, how many \nboys or girls, \"no idea\".\n\nBut 3 or 4 parents smiling/laughing right there where their kids are dead? \nOne you chock up to, well I don't know. 4 would be the coincidence of the \ncentury. \n\nI don't know of videos of psych opinion, but I'm sure most would be \ndisgusted at the person for asking. What other coroners? There were no \nbodies for any to see. That's is proven to me by the cop and Carver's both \nsaying the rifle was used when it wasn't discovered until after the \nshooting. How'd that happen? \n\nUm, how many people do you think know of this? The actors who were fooled \ncouldn't. Do you realize the whole world saw them? You yourself wouldn't \nthink it's true. They are in an impossible situation. Homeland Security may \nnot have known (you realize they were there right? On tape testimony. \nThey'd been there for weeks doing drill rehearsal I imagine). Snowden and \nTuskegee are a different story. Paper trails versus live tv. \n\nThe APA would do no such thing. To challenge grieving parents? Their \nbehavior wasn't so bizarre they need shock therapy. It's a matter of common \nsense. The dad especially, laughing, asking \"just read the card?\" And \nobviously getting into character. Not seeing this can only mean cognitive \ndissonance is working overtime it seems. I've never seen a person prepare \nhimself to cry unless acting. I don't need an expert APA member. Serious. I \nsee now you responded to gun. I've never heard that it was a shotgun. I've \nwatched his interview many times. But yeah the killer dead would have no \ntrial so that's plausible. \n\nYou've given me what you saw on TV. So have you not seen the picture in the \nvan with toys and poster with kids pictures on it? This on the day of the \nshooting when they're dead inside. Or any of the hearings with police \nchief? He didn't want to answer questions. He was embarrassed and shamed \nand must have known and gotten gifted. Because he resigned/retired. \n\nI believed this was real. There's no reason not too. I had an \n\"enlightenment\" not too long ago and not from drugs... I started seeing \nthrough bs and fakery easily. It's strange. It's basically a paradigm \nshift. From seeing the world through the prism of tv and the illusion of \nchoice in politics and everything else thst brainwashed us to believe the \nillusion. We live in a world where people can't tell Sarah Palin quotes \nfrom Tina Fays. I don't think low of anyone who doesn't see this , I know I \ndid. It's perception and whether we consciously want to.

Massive data \nmining? That was once a conspiracy theory. Proven right. An example I \nalready mentioned, secret government experiments on citizens, proven. \n\n\n*See, if conspiracy theorists were actually using logic, science and \ncriminology to investigate Sandy Hook, someone would have uploaded a video \nshowing comparisons of Carver talking in different interviews. The reason \nwhy no one has is probably because when people do compare it, they realize \njust as I posited, thats just how he acts. I can't find the original video \nI found years ago of him at a coroners conference, but look up this video \n\"Dr. Wayne Carver on Forensic files.\" When you realize that he is in a \nposition where he sees dead people every day, its not hard to imagine why \nhe wasn't bawling like a new born about Sandy Hook. The guy has seen a lot \nof bad already. And yes, its just speculation for us because we ( at least \nI am not) are not Coroners or psychologists and can not determine if he was \nacting out of the ordinary. I do have some psychology education from \nUniversity but I won't rely on that. Lets rely on experts. Why hasn't any \nconspiracy theorist provided a video or testimony from other Coroners? No \nvideos interviewing a psychologist asking their opinion? Maybe its because \nprofessionals know Carver's behavior was not out of the ordinary. \n\n\n*Who involved with the conspiracy has \" come forward\" ? Saying that the \npubic would not believe any number of witnesses giving testimony supporting \nthe conspiracy theory is a cop out. If that were true, then no one would \nhave believed edward snowden. No one would believe wikilinks. No one would \nbelieve the Tuskeegee experiments. Once again, there are lots of real \nconspiracies where people have come forward, and in the case of data \nmining, only one person ( Edward Snowden) and people believe the conspiracy \nis real. Its just that in the case of Sandy Hook...there was no conspiracy. \n\n\n*As I mentioned before, if there was anything truly wrong with the parents, \npsychologists from around the world would have noticed something from the \nparent interviews that were broadcast for weeks. The APA would have issued \na statement. If the parents were acting weird, a conspiracy theorist that \nwas serious would interview psychologists, show them the parents and the \npsychologists would confirm or reject the theory. But no...no conspiracy \ntheorists have done this...maybe because professionals know that there was \nnothing weird going on. \n\n\n* Have you even looked at the released crime scene photos? You can actually \nsee inside the trunk of the car and see the weapon the cops pulled out on \nthe TV news...it was a shotgun...Even if you believe the photos are \ndoctored, ask 10 gun enthusiasts who are not familiar with the video to \nwatch it ( not familiar to reduce bias) and ask them what kind of weapon \nwas pulled out. And be sure to use the best quality recording. I did that \nand they told me it was a shotgun. Carver was telling the truth. People \nthought the bushmaster was in the car, but they were wrong. \n\n\n*Carver explained that as a pathologist, he doesn't have the expertise nor \nauthority to release information like what caliber bullet was used. Those \nspecifics are reserved for the police reports. I urge you to ask a \npathologist if that is Bologna or typical. You mistake the things you see \nin the video......He didn't forget which weapons caused what \nwounds....Carver said \" Its a good thing there's no prosecution or else I \ncouldn't answer that.\" He clearly explained that had the killer lived, and \nthere was to be a prosecution, he could not disclose information like what \nweapons were used or what caliber bullets.

You say maybe he has aspergers, and that's \nplausible. But pure speculation, like mine, based on body language and \ndemeanor. Saying he acts the same way in other interviews means, I don't \nknow what you mean here. If he's acting the same, that's consistent in both \nour scenarios. My son is Aspergers so i honestly considered it, and he \nstill could be Aspy and oblivious. Both still plausible. \n\nI think it's actually a very simple conspiracy if so. What's easier than \nnot telling the players anything? They don't have any worry. This why I \ncame to this realization of it not being live/delayed or even prerecorded. \nAn intern in a cubicle in DC with phone and fax and an RC. But seriously, \nthe simplicity is what made sense to me especially considering everyone \nalways wrongly yells at me that a conspiracy has too many people and too \nmuch this and that so it couldn't work. Actually if the public buys a story \nand has no reason to believe it to be false (which is the reason PsyOps are \ndone this way because no one would think this while watching, which is why \nit has to be a sensational crime for distraction) then it doesn't really \nmatter if a person comes clean or 30; who's going to believe them? No \namount of evidence will change minds once it's set, as a general rule. This \nagain is why govt executes these events as such. It's perfect. \n\nNo I'm not a psychologist (my wife is, heh) but a realist/cynic. When so \nmany parents are displaying similarly inappropriate in context behavior, I \ncan say it's too coincidental to be plausible. The odds if there were dead \nkids and multiple parents are seen smiling merely hours after a gruesome \nmurder are not good. You wouldn't take that bet with those odds in Vegas I \nassume. \n\nThe gun. I'm going to give benefit of the doubt on the multiple gun count \nconfusion just because it's about to be irrelevant. The report from the \nschool by I guess a cop is that he saw Adam dead of self-inflicted gunshot. \nHe used the bushmaster I believe was the name, and kids were also killed \nwith the same. News was right there recording his car as an officer pulled \na gun out. The gun the officer said was inside and Adam used. Furthermore, \nas Carver is talking with the press, he's asked the caliber of bullet used. \nHe says the long gun. A reporter asks again thinking he misspoke and Carver \nsaid long gun agsin. The reporter agsin said \"because our information is \nthat it was...) to which he said \"you have bad information, laughing. \n\nNow I would say that this is solid evidence that they have not seen any \nbodies. How could they both say the gun used was the long gun when that gun \nwasn't used, being found in trunk after the shooting. Also, before saying \nwhich gun he was asked the caliber bullet, can't remember and said \nsomething like \"luckily I don't have to testify in front of a judge but I \nthink...\". That's another powerful indication that he saw no body nor knows \nhe is on real TV. He would never think to say he would NOT be in court if \nthat wasn't what was happening. It's a statement that could not come out if \nhe was on TV and knew it because the mind isn't conceiving for any reason \nit's fake. I would call it impossible but... These are too many solid clues \nthat the cop nor Carver could have seen any bodies, unless we get into \npeople moving guns and whatnot but, no. The script was the long gun, and \nsomeone screwed up the prop placement but it was nothing they'd worry about \nonly if there were no bodies, and no live tv.\n\nSo, what you think? \n\n"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6EEW0nfhYmmFbY4W-GDp7g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "awfawe efaw", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xhdd4nlqayxsxu04cchfjcmfgdbk4kas", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-05T19:12:41.920Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6EEW0nfhYmmFbY4W-GDp7g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.26501599999999997, "formal_score": 20, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-05T19:12:41.920Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110404993707360998163", "textDisplay": "+Greg Williams I still don't buy into conspiracie theories like Sandy hook \nbecause no one can every provide actual proof.
