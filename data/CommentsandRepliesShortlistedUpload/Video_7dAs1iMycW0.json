If \nit's a \"joke,\" it's in extremely poor taste, showing no consideration, \nhome-training or proper manners/respect at all, at the very least. The \nreviewer advocates for a secular humanistic worldview (against Jesus Christ \nand faith) in many places throughout the movie review; but perhaps the most \nobvious is when he places the value of earthly, temporal life above eternal \nlife (near the end).\n\n\"Some people are apathetic towards Christianity. Some people are neither in \nits favor or against it. This is a simple fact.\"\n\n\" He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me \nscatters.\" -Jesus Christ (Luke 11:23). There is no \"middle ground\".\n\nYou can say (in essence) that Jesus spoke lies, or was fallible, whatever \n(when you say \"Jesus saying something does NOT make it true,\" it is the \nsame as accusing Him of lying or being ignorant). But that is a very \nserious accusation for any imperfect, sinful (by nature) human being to \nmake towards the Son of God. He said, \"if you do not believe that I am He, \nyou will die in your sins.\" (John 8:24); also in John 14:6, \"I am the way, \nthe truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.\" It \nis your choice and the consequences will be your responsibility; but as for \nmyself, I choose to believe Him. As I would not want anyone to miss out on \nthe hope of eternal life, I hope and pray that you will, also.\n\nThe directors and producers of *God's Not Dead* did not intend their movie \nto be a caricature or comedy, it is a serious movie with a very serious, \nsincere message.\n\n\"How is the scene he edited out more likely to make people support it???\"\n\nNo need for triple question-marks. The scene in question is where the \nelderly mother of Dean Cain's character has a moment of mental and \nspiritual clarity, where she answers her son's question in several \nwell-articulated sentences just why the fact that his career, finances and \npersonal life is going oh-so-well for him at that point in time (with no \napparent challenges or adversity) can very easily be a trap, rather than a \nconfirmation that he is on the right path in life. Shortly afterwards she \nlooks at him blankly and asks, \"Who did you say you were again?\" He is \nemotionally shaken; and it's not a scene easily explained away by a crass \njoking \"reviewer\" determined to drag every idea of Christianity down; but \nnever mind\u2014you'll just dismiss this as \"propaganda\" just like you have \neverything else. I'm just pointing out that it wasn't something \"Ralph\" \ncould so easily make fun of; and so he left it out.\n\n\"Again, how does this (cursing) indicate any religion?\"\n\nIf you do not see why the flippant, mocking use of profanity (as the \nreviewer repeatedly engages in) is incompatible with Christianity and even \nmost conservative religious faiths, then either you do not understand the \nfaith (do not know the Bible) or your sense of morality has become so \nskewed that you can no longer discern right from wrong; or even what is \nconsidered acceptable among strangers communicating and interacting in \npolite society. You go out of your way to give the reviewer every positive \nconcession, regardless of how implausible based on his clearly demonstrated \nworldview and behavior; and not a single credit whatsoever to the \nintentions and heart motivations of the filmmakers. And you want to charge \n*them* with bias?\nThe Bible has an explanation for this lack of discernment, which is pretty \nmuch prevalent among the majority of people in today's world:\n\n\"Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;\nWho put darkness for light, and light for darkness;\nWho put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!\" (Isaiah 5:20)."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQEEPHJAxYs-RtPsjVbIVRg", "inappropriate_score": 1.6949152542372881, "authorDisplayName": "Spikedwallman5000", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12mynqjhyeqfx2v223zft15cyvztn0h504", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-30T06:53:32.856Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQEEPHJAxYs-RtPsjVbIVRg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.87432759999999998, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-30T06:53:32.856Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TtbCVU2PCYQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/xp2jZGKOIn0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101781966203603295757", "textDisplay": "+deadlyspinner How the fuck is someone supposed to know the movie is bad \nbefore watching it?

It's filth. \nIt's indicative (i.e. a symptom) of what is wrong with 95+% of the world \ntoday.\n\nHe patronizingly says, \"I'm not going to tell you whether I'm a Christian, \nor a Muslim, or an atheist, because that's none of your concern.\" He didn't \nhave to make that statement. It's obvious he's not a Christian because of \nthe language he flippantly uses (\"These people are gonna f---ing dislike \nthe video, anyway...\" \"Oh s---, this movie's gonna suck...\"; \"Who the f--- \nare you?\" and \"Are you f---ing kidding me??\"). And as Jesus said, we are \neither for or against Him (Matt. 12:30-37). There is no middle \"neutral\" \nground like the reviewer (and some others here) prefer to pretend. It's \nquite clear the reviewer is either not familiar with Colossians 3:8; 4:6; \nPsalm 10:4-7; Ephesians 4:29, 5:4; or James 1:26 or chapter 3 at all; or if \nhe is, he's quite thoroughly dismissed it as totally irrelevant to his \nlife. The trash that comes out of his mouth obviously doesn't bother him \none iota. He thinks it's funny and cute; and that his viewers should all \nfind it comical as well. As such his opinion on the value of a \n*Christian-themed* movie is skewed from the get-go. The fact that some \nprofessing \"Christians\" here actually agree with him (and would \nunconditionally give him the time of their day on something relevant to \ntheir faith\u2014NOT his) is especially telling regarding just how much the \nChristian faith and the average American church has been dumbed-down in our \npost-Christian culture.\n \nIronically, he inserts a graphic still of fingers in ears, eyes shut at 2:32. \nThat's about what the atheists and agnostics are doing in response to the \nmain message of the movie. They can criticize the casting, the dialogue, \nand other technical aspects of the movie (and in some ways, they have valid \npoints, if only they would express them respectfully); but when it comes to \nevaluating the underlying spiritual message, he's completely unqualified to \ndo so. He's edited out important scenes (such as the part where the elderly \nwoman with Alzheimer's experiences a moment of mental clarity\u2014he includes \npart of the visual, but not the dialogue). Why? Because they don't \"fit\" \nhis agenda, which is namely to make fun of the movie and to discourage \nothers from supporting it.\n\nI would be VERY curious to see how this supposedly unbiased reviewer would \nweigh in on a movie like (for just one example) \"Saved!\" - a profane, \nobscene secular mainstream caricature of Christianity starring Mandy Moore \n- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332375/ Would he honestly admit the mockery \nand shallow, *stereotyped* straw-men characters it sets up to represent \nconservative Christianity? Or would he be laughing his head off and \npraising the \"comedic wit\" the \"superior writing\" and brilliant casting?

Christians don't get to \ndictate what is or is not accepted in society anymore, and in my opinion \nthat's a good thing. If a Christian is uncomfortable with that, they don't \nhave to participate.\n\n2. Straight Outta Compton is a biopic that is largely based in fact. It is \nnot a movie that bashes Christianity in any way I'm aware of, and again, if \na Christian doesn't like it, they don't have to watch it. Again, we live in \na free society, and Christians cannot tell people what to release or watch. \nThat doesn't make those people anti-Christian.\n\n3. I agree with you that professed belief in Christianity makes them \nhypocrites in that regard. I can see how from your perspective that may be \n\"anti-God\", but again, I don't see how that is an attack on Christianity, \nlet alone Satanic. If anything, it highlights character flaws on the men in \nparticular, and doesn't make a statement about any ideology.\n\n4. Straight Outta Compton literally says *nothing* about mocking a god. I \nthink you're overanalyzing and overrreacting. It's about frustrated, \nimpoverished black youths challenging the system, in albeit morally \nquestionable and occasionally repugnant ways. I'm sure a certain amount of \nit is embellished as well."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO16__ktPacw-yEC-9xVJeQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ThatClassic70sGirl", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12evfkg2lrqfdukx23ngvgoysmrc3oei", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-25T14:59:37.289Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCO16__ktPacw-yEC-9xVJeQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.28168199999999999, "formal_score": 84, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-25T14:59:37.289Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101204485940532276846", "textDisplay": "+TheDapperSwindler What I'm saying is that they are movies where the \nChristian (if they lack the wisdom to avoid them) has to constantly keep \nsteeling themselves against a godless worldview or absent portrayal of God \nthat is being presumed (if not actually deliberately promoted) in the movie \npresentation. Most believers, especially if they are teenagers or not \nmature in the faith are simply not up to the challenge.\n\nWhat about *Straight Outta Compton* (for example) is merely \"a-Christian\"? \nYes, the young men in question may have been profiled and treated unfairly \nby law enforcement. But at the same time, they were actually \nlaw-breakers\u2014not to mention breaking God's laws\u2014like when they were abusing \nand dealing drugs and violently mistreating women, as if the police's \nbehavior excused anything they might say or do. As the movie reviewer \nconcludes, \"So is chanting 'F--- the police!' really the moral equivalent \nof Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech (as Jerry Heller \ninsists to this day)? Straight Outta Compton will leave lots of people \nthinking that it is.\"\n\nIf gangsta rappers such as Easy-E and Tupak Shakur really believed in God \n(as evidenced by the former wearing a cross, and the latter rapping about \nprayer), in the movie or in real life, they would have sought a more \npeaceful way to promote their (in some cases genuine) grievances and seek \nsocial justice. Instead they are on stage cursing up a storm, blaspheming \nGod, promoting drug abuse and general rebellion against all authority, just \nfor the sake of rebellion. That's not just anti-Christian, it's Satanic and \ndemonstrating a lack of self-control. Romans 13:1-5 says, \"Let every soul \nbe subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except \nfrom God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore \nwhoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who \nresist will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to \ngood works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do \nwhat is good, and you will have praise from the same. For he is God\u2019s \nminister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not \nbear the sword in vain; for he is God\u2019s minister, an avenger to execute \nwrath on him who practices evil. Therefore you must be subject, not only \nbecause of wrath but also for conscience\u2019 sake.\"\n\nIn other words, where the laws are good, not contradictory to God's own \ncommandments, and doesn't harm anyone (like wearing seat belts in a moving \nvehicle, or avoiding abuse of pharmaceuticals, for example), *go along with \nthem*. It's for our own good, and reflects well as a witness of Him. Where \nthe law is evil, we are instructed to stand and resist (Acts 4:18-20 - like \nwith Operation Rescue engaging in civil disobedience). Peacefully, \nrespectfully, humbly, and above all, non-violently. This is not what NWA/ *Straight \nOutta Compton* is advocating. \"Fight back! Seek revenge! Hate and destroy! \nIndulge yourself!\" I conclude that a movie like *Straight Outta Compton* \nhas a lot more to do with mocking, slandering and misrepresenting God than \nwhat might be apparent on the surface."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3T832L_8EnkyTcGZ-cqyg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheDapperSwindler", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12evfkg2lrqfdukx23ngvgoysmrc3oei", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-25T13:58:34.844Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCn3T832L_8EnkyTcGZ-cqyg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.41833600000000004, "formal_score": 14, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-25T13:59:23.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aPT5v2Y9oQg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAg/AgWpN1Hby7I/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118173100845180793816", "textDisplay": "+ThatClassic70sGirl So you define a movie as \"anti-God\" not just if it's \nblatantly attacking Christianity, but also if it does not conform to \nChristian ideals?

This \nbears some explanation and we will consider several examples.\nRemember that evolutionists teach that everything is constantly evolving \ninto a higher and more complex order. In other words, they believe things \ncontinue to get better and better instead of worse and worse.\nIf water being heated on a stove is at 150 degrees Fahrenheit, and the \nburner is turned off, the temperature will drop instead of rise. It will \nmove toward colder rather than hotter. If a ball is placed on a hill, it \nwill always roll downhill and not uphill. Energy used to perform any \nparticular task changes from usable energy to unusable in the performing of \nthat task. It will always go from a higher energy level to a lower energy \nlevel\u2014where less and less energy is available for use.\nWhen applied to the universe, the second law of thermodynamics indicates \nthat the universe is winding down\u2014moving toward disorder or entropy\u2014not \nwinding up or moving toward more perfect order and structure. In short, the \nentire universe is winding down!\nEven evolutionists admit that the theory of evolution and the second law of \nthermodynamics are completely incompatible with each other. Consider: \n\u201cRegarding the second law of thermodynamics [universally accepted \nscientific law which states that all things left to themselves will tend to \nrun down] or the law of entropy, it is observed, \u2018It would hardly be \npossible to conceive of two more completely opposite principles than this \nprinciple of entropy increase and the principle of evolution. Each is \nprecisely the converse of the other. As [Aldous] Huxley defined it, \nevolution involves a continual increase of order, of organization, of size, \nof complexity\u2026It seems axiomatic that both cannot possibly be true. But \nthere is no question whatever that the second law of thermodynamics is \ntrue\u2019\u201d (The Twilight of Evolution).\nLike a top or a yo-yo, the universe must have been \u201cwound up.\u201d Since the \nuniverse is constantly winding down, the second law of thermodynamics looms \nbefore us in the form of a great question: who wound it up? The only \nplausible answer is God!\n\nWe have established that Creation demands a Creator. Where does this leave \nevolution?\nThe theory of evolution is shot full of inconsistencies. Evolutionists have \nseized on many theories, within the overall theory of evolution, in an \nattempt to explain the origins of plants, animals, the heavens, and the \nEarth.\nOver and over, these \u201ctheorists\u201d try to explain how life evolved from \ninanimate material into more complex life forms until it reached the \npinnacle\u2014human beings.\nYet, as one geologist wrote, \u201cIt must be significant that nearly all the \nevolutionary stories I learned as [a] student\u2026have been debunked\u201d (The \nNature of the Fossil Record, Proceedings of the Geological Association).\nPerhaps the biggest reason that so many theories within the overall theory \nof evolution collapse is because they contain terrible logic requiring \ngreat leaps in faith to believe. Here is one example of a \u201cdebunked\u201d \ntheory: \u201cMany evolutionists have tried to argue that humans are 99% similar \nchemically to apes and blood precipitation tests do indicate that the \nchimpanzee is people\u2019s closest relative. Yet regarding this we must observe \nthe following: \u2018Milk chemistry indicates that the donkey is man\u2019s closest \nrelative.\u2019 \u2018Cholesterol level tests indicate that the garter snake is man\u2019s \nclosest relative.\u2019 \u2018Tear enzyme chemistry indicates that the chicken is \nman\u2019s closest relative.\u2019 \u2018On the basis of another type of blood chemistry \ntest, the butter bean is man\u2019s closest relative\u2019\u201d (The Twilight of \nEvolution).\n\nEveryone has witnessed explosions. Have you ever seen one that was orderly? \nOr one that created a watch or a clock? Or one that produced a single thing \nof exquisite design\u2014instead of the certain result of chaos and destruction? \nIf you threw a million hand grenades, you would see them produce chaos and \ndestruction a million times! There would never be an exception.\nConsider the following quotes, involving the likelihood of an explosion \ncreating the entire natural realm of life all around us on Earth\u2014let alone \nthe beautiful magnificence and order seen no matter how far one looks out \ninto space.\nDr. B.G. Ranganathan said, \u201c\u2026the probability of life originating from \naccident is comparable to the unabridged dictionary resulting from an \nexplosion in a printing shop\u201d (Origins?). And this only speaks to the \nlikelihood of any life at all, rather than the most highly complex forms \nsuch as large animals or human beings\u2014let alone all the different kinds of \nlife that exist today.\n\nNeed I say more?

Do scientists tell us that it has always \nexisted? Or have they determined that there was a moment in time in which \nall matter came into existence? The answer to the second question is, yes! \nBut what is the proof that this is true?\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics is stated as follows: matter and energy can \nbe neither created nor destroyed. There are no natural processes that can \nalter either matter or energy in this way. This means that there is no new \nmatter or energy coming into existence and there is no new matter or energy \npassing out of existence. All who state that the universe came into \nexistence from nothing violate the first law of thermodynamics, which was \nestablished by the very scientific community who now seem willing to ignore \nit. In summary, this law plainly demonstrates that the universe, and all \nmatter and energy within it, must have had a divine origin\u2014a specific \nmoment in which it was created by someone who was all-powerful.\nWith the coming of the Atomic Age, beginning with the discovery of radium \nin 1898 by Madame Curie, came the knowledge that all radioactive elements \ncontinually give off radiation. Consider! Uranium has an atomic weight of \n238.0. As it decomposes, it releases a helium atom three times. Each helium \natom has a weight of 4. With the new weight of 226.0, uranium becomes \nradium. Radium continues to give off additional atoms until eventually the \nend product becomes the heavy inert element called lead. This takes a \ntremendous amount of time. While the process of uranium turning into radium \nis very long, the radium turns into lead in 1,590 years.\nWhat are we saying? There was a point in time when the uranium could not \nhave existed, because it always breaks down in a highly systematic, \ncontrolled way. It is not stable like lead or other elements. It breaks \ndown. This means there was a specific moment in time when all radioactive \nelements came into existence. Remember, all of them\u2014uranium, radium, \nthorium, radon, polonium, francium, protactinium and others\u2014have not \nexisted forever. This represents absolute proof that matter came into \nexistence or, in other words, matter has not always existed!\nThis flies directly in the face of evolutionary thought\u2014that everything \ngradually evolved into something else. Here is the problem. You cannot have \nsomething slowly come into existence from nothing! Matter could not have \ncome into existence by itself. No rational person could believe that the \nentire universe\u2014including all of the radioactive elements that prove there \nwas a specific time of beginning\u2014gradually came into existence BY ITSELF!\nThrough your own efforts, try to build something\u2014anything\u2014from nothing. \nEven with your creative power engaged in the effort, you would never be \nable to do it. You would not be able\u2014in a hundred lifetimes of trying\u2014to \nproduce a single thing from nothing!\nCan any doubter believe that everything in the entirety of the universe, in \nall of its exquisite detail, came into existence completely by itself? Be \nhonest. Accept facts. This is proof that the existing natural realm demands \nthe existence of a Great Creator!\n\n\n\n\n"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0ezbrFad_kM3X-XybcMe5A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "CognizantPsyche", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12azvbqxkbhtxrdh22tjj3aauuhjdy5b04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-16T20:11:50.488Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0ezbrFad_kM3X-XybcMe5A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.87611349999999999, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-16T20:11:50.488Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sEHqR0aQyxU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGs/mZlHLg367uM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109014975091501544405", "textDisplay": "+Adam Gray  \"all of the scientific evidence supporting God\" Name one."}}]}, "z131x11ixsb4uhms523ovd4q2nqsxfk4k04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFJCNUMOlkvMNTdBLBnDZNg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TpoDJpsOG6k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB5I/TLIASvb8OMc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 6.666666666666667, "authorDisplayName": "Smoak Raider", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-19T20:24:09.190Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCFJCNUMOlkvMNTdBLBnDZNg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.98663195999999997, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-19T20:24:09.190Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118116659519748591297", "textDisplay": "That Alex jones bit I'm fucking done \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z121hh3ptv2yib5ql04cjhupbmvnx51xxds": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5lm9gEj94S4_6Dh-rPhZ1A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "IJDK73", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-15T12:53:40.365Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5lm9gEj94S4_6Dh-rPhZ1A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.094694, "formal_score": 36, "updatedAt": "2014-10-15T12:53:40.365Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106004661698588775188", "textDisplay": "This makes me wonder what talents You have been giving?

I hope this is going to be a \nrespectful and dignified discussion. I love a good and honest battle of the \nmind based on facts or science, but You can pick which ever suits You \nbetter. Opinion is okay, but please support it with facts; otherwise it is \njust another floating pink personal and private cloud, in short has no \nproven substance or matter. \nHope to hear back from You and others, my regards Ian Jensen\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13msf1penbkenby404cf3npfyupgbkocg0": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDF3orGtk0yvyeewy_M-ytA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Quantum Blop", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-09T12:04:53.015Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDF3orGtk0yvyeewy_M-ytA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.415634, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-04-09T12:04:53.015Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112578462799864064853", "textDisplay": "It's not like they forced you to watch it if youseen the trailer you would \nknow it was Christian then don't watch la\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12nj5srxlrpvfhf422hdr0hcrfayl3sc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjOAMSO7CnezXPCT_3hjQ9g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lEqJkRGSl-Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAqk/5pLlfRPUTUQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Fulisiailagitele Su'e", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-03T12:59:29.149Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjOAMSO7CnezXPCT_3hjQ9g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99989974589999997, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-08-03T12:59:29.149Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115997305617035035673", "textDisplay": "God Bless You!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13edvwz3o2jvnilf22ej5cqmvewvniql04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCht0jD-Dhbu4AIuA6Euq88g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Dace Kozlova", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-29T01:20:27.205Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCht0jD-Dhbu4AIuA6Euq88g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.062329999999999997, "formal_score": 54, "updatedAt": "2014-12-29T01:20:27.205Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109129332767809762953", "textDisplay": "Stop\nThis movie is very good and I honestly think more people should watch it\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpwGRCUK7j8XjTQd5fU2btw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "GameboyCW", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13edvwz3o2jvnilf22ej5cqmvewvniql04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-30T03:55:00.085Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCpwGRCUK7j8XjTQd5fU2btw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.17471999999999999, "formal_score": 7, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-30T03:55:40.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117232233001914120786", "textDisplay": "If you like this movie, good for you but not everyone has to watch the same \nmovies you like."}}]}, "z13jjlgzxqenhnp1c224vlfjzqyxfvdoh04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MQ4XlkKOFtPuLQpaM81zg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tfvm1ZLt5yg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApM/EqEuV7WHjH4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Luke Parris", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-17T04:37:55.325Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0MQ4XlkKOFtPuLQpaM81zg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.39446000000000003, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-17T04:37:55.325Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109756953048875848846", "textDisplay": "ok you suck I enjoyed the movie and it taught me a very good lesson you \nwouldn't know your so caught up in youtube.

It wasn't my \nintention to avoid this discussion. I just get so many replies on various \nvideos here on YouTube, plus other forums and online groups\u2014many of which \ntake place only minutes following my last posting\u2014that it is hard to keep \nup. Even since my last couple posts, I see where there are two more \nresponses that have come in just since I started typing this; and it's been \nvirtually impossible for me to keep up, even with some that do not require \na reply or I otherwise decide to just let an issue go unchallenged.\n\nOk, well, I think I see what you're saying now. I do agree with you, that \nthese types of actions would be considered true abuse, and not motivated by \nthe spirit of Christ on behalf of these parents and families. A spiritual \nfast, for example, should only be entered into voluntarily by the \nindividual partaking in it, motivated by a heart that is broken and seeking \nmore of God in their lives\u2014NOT imposed on someone else as a method of \npunishment. While I do believe that the \"rod\" can be used in some \ncircumstances, as Scripture clearly indicates, a child (regardless of their \nage) should *never* be disciplined out of a parent's own anger or \nfrustration; or used as a means of vengeance. The Bible (as you probably \nare already aware) calls Christ's followers to \"be swift to hear, slow to \nspeak, slow to wrath: For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of \nGod.\" (James 1:19-20). If parents are inflicting large bruises, sprains, \nlacerations, broken bones, etc., then this is clearly indicative of a \ndeeper problem on their behalf which calls for protective intervention.\n\nHowever, having acknowledged this, in all honesty and fairness I suspect \nsuch extreme cases would represent the exception, and not the rule among \nmost Christian families who are genuinely and humbly living out their faith \nin other areas of their lives. On the other hand, there are those parents \nwho were raised \"religious\" (as you labeled it) in an authoritarian (not \nloving) home, but who have never actually received the spirit of Christ (or \nwhom are backslidden); and are acting according to the preconditioning they \nin turn received as children. My father's oldest son was this way toward \nhis stepchildren, sadly\u2014not because of how he was raised (because our \nfather\u2014also a truck driver, incidentally\u2014 was relatively easygoing and \nrespectful toward the things of God, even though he himself was not saved \nat that particular time of his life)\u2014but due in some part to the \nconditioning and things he experienced while in military service. Looking \nback, I would say that he likely paid for his transgressions (some of which \nwere very serious, if I understood correctly) at least in an earthly sense, \nas he wound up divorced (with many severed family relationships), faced \nmultiple financial and health challenges and died before the age of sixty. \n\nKeep in mind that not all who profess Christ's name are actually truly born \nof His Spirit. Not to suggest that people are perfect; because of course *none \nof us* (Christian or unbelieving) are. But among those who rightfully claim \nHis name, there should be a general spirit of humility being displayed in \ntheir interactions with others (and in dealing with their own mistakes), \neven (or perhaps, especially) within their own families. In the same book \nand chapter that encourages children to \"obey [their] parents in the Lord,\" \nparents are also instructed not to \"provoke [their] children to wrath\" \n(Ephesians 6:4).\n\nWhile I'm not sure what you mean by your friend's inability to \" 'be gay' \nin his [parents'] house,\" I do know that in this age of grace (and with \nJesus' various teachings emphasizing love and forgiveness), it is not any \nbeliever's place, much less calling, to physically, violently \"beat sin out \nof\" someone else. It sounds to me like his father was likely raised in a \ntraditional, authoritarian home (where stereotypes of gender roles were \nfalsely attributed to the Bible, modeled and taught); and thus received his \nson's admission to SSA as a personal insult/threat to his own manhood. \nThis, of course is a gross misconception and should never have happened. It \nis my hope and prayer that your friend would be able to see beyond the \nweaknesses and injustices present in his own familial upbringing, to the \ntrue spirit of Christ and the Father Who loves him (despite his sin) beyond \nall imagining and human capabilities/failings.\n\n>\"thats why I don't like Christian propaganda, it is irresponsible with the \ntruth of reality and all the darker aspects of the human psyche, it is by \ndefinition hypocrisy.\"\n\nI agree with you that the circumstances you described definitely represent \nhumans \"missing the mark,\" if not outright, intentional hypocrisy. But I \nthink that the objective of the producers of this film, was to present the \nChristian faith in a more functional (not dysfunctional) way of how things *should \nbe*; or at least how Christian virtues like faith, prayer, intercession, \nhumility and forgiveness (in the wake of human failure) normally operate in \nresponse to the difficulties that present themselves in our lives. \n\nI don't necessarily agree with the implication that the Christians were \npresented as false \"straw man\" characters in this movie. They were not \nperfect or without personal human failings by any means. Josh's girlfriend, \nfor instance, may have professed faith; but yet was portrayed as immature, \nshallow and self-centered in her lack of consideration for Josh's own \nconvictions and feelings; not to mention her own understanding and \napplication of the Bible to her priorities, values and the way she lived \nout her life. Mina was certainly not a paragon of consistent Christian \nvirtue, inasmuch as she'd disobediently gotten herself mixed up in an \nunequally-yoked (2 Cor. 6:14-18) relationship with an unbelieving man. Not \nonly that, but it was implied in the film that they were sleeping together \noutside of marriage; which not only spoke strongly of hypocrisy to those \nobserving her life from the outside, but had to have had a negative effect \non her own personal relationship and communion with God. The older woman \nsuffering dementia obviously didn't have everything figured out, either; \nsince her hotshot yuppie attorney son (played by Dean Cain) was such a \nfirst-class self-centered materialistic, insensitive boor to practically \neveryone around him... For being such a strong Christian, where did she go \nwrong in raising him? (because it didn't happen in a vacuum).

Do \n*you* think it's right, acceptable and good for Christians to use \nprofanity? Why or why not?\n\n*\" No matter what your assumption is, you cannot say that he is not a \nchristian...\"*\n\nWhat unfounded \"assumption\" am I making here? Even discounting his \nflagrant, deliberately antagonizing use of profanity (the evidence present \nfor all to hear), I would find it *extremely doubtful* that \nralphthemoviemaker is Christian (and just \"hiding\" it for purposes of \n\"review objectivity\"); because for one thing, he is more concerned about \nhow the Muslims and atheists are portrayed (i.e., it is clear that he sees \nall faiths as valid, equal paths to God) than the truth about Jesus Christ \nbeing proclaimed. Near the end of the review he says, \"Once again, I am not \nsaying I am for religion or against religion...\" Who does he think he's \nkidding? A true Christian would strongly and conscientiously avoid \nreferring to their faith (because there's no such thing as a Christian \nhaving a complete *lack of* faith) as \"religion.\" It's a relationship with \nthe living, eternal God of the universe.\n \nYou just can't be a Christian and be \"neutral\" about something like that. \nWhether you personally accept it or not (that is not the issue here), from \nthe Christian belief perspective, there is such a thing as sin. God defines \nwhat sin is in the Bible. Not only is all of mankind born into it (original \nsin); but we commit sin (of varying degrees) daily, because we have an \nunredeemed sin nature inherited from Adam and Eve. Only Jesus Christ ever \nlived a perfect life on earth without sin, because He is both God and man. \nWithout His voluntary blood sacrifice, we would be destined for an eternal \ndeath, because God is perfectly holy and cannot allow sin in His presence.\n\nSo, given that life is temporary\u2014a few short decades, as juxtaposed with \nall of eternity, we try our best to live in the light of that eternity. \nWhen we accept Jesus' sacrifice for sin on our behalf, He becomes more \nprecious to us than anything (or anyone) else. Jesus validated the books of \nthe Bible as containing God's truth, and otherwise spoke highly of them \nduring His earthly ministry. So Christians also value them, believe, read \nand study on a regular basis, pray and otherwise strive to become more \nChristlike (and do) what God's Word instructs us.\n\nDo you honestly think that if ralphthemoviemaker *were* Christian, he'd \nfail to see any value in the professor receiving Christ into his life \nbefore he died\u2014*knowing* that he'd be lost for all eternity without Him? \nInstead he rants about how the ministers had (from his perspective) \"pushed \ntheir beliefs\" onto him and supposedly took advantage of the natural fear \nand uncertainty he felt as his life came to an end in order to proselytyze \nand gain another spiritual notch in their belts. You can hear the mocking \nskeptical tone in his voice as he narrates that part of the movie. The fact \nthat the reviewer chose to take the most cynical possible view reveals much \nabout his own spiritual condition.\n\n_\"...which is not relevant at all.\"\n\nIt *is* relevant, because it is *a Christian movie*; and someone who does \nnot share that faith will miss (and/or find fault with) the main message. \nGuaranteed, every time. The reviewer's lack of faith (for example) is why \nhe sees the physical, earthly life as more important than the eternal, \nspiritual one; even though it is made clear that it is almost certain the \nprofessor will die before medical help can be summoned. Frankly, I think \nthe movie would've been better had they had someone call for an ambulance \n*while* they were praying for him, if only to preempt the obvious \nobjections from unbelievers in the viewing audience. It didn't have to be \neither/or. I think a lot of possible plot lines that could have been more \nrealistically expanded, with more complete character development (such as \nthe professor coming to faith more gradually, or through a lesser crisis) \nhad to be cut short due to the length of the movie, which was unfortunate. \nBut that doesn't make it \"pathetic\" or a terrible movie. It's just not as \ngood as it could have been.\n\n_\"Also, Movie is entertainment, in many different ways, you watch a movie \nto enjoy it, both in the message it represents and the way they represents \nit.\"\n\nWell, I have to disagree with you here, because as a Christian, how could I \nenjoy something that doesn't reflect truth and is dragging my spirit and \nemotions down? In the Book of Philippians, we are instructed, \"whatever \nthings are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, \nwhatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are \nof good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything \npraiseworthy\u2014meditate on these things.\" (4:8). Also we are called to be \n\"casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the \nknowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of \nChrist\" (2 Cor. 10:5). That goes for entertainment as well. Sure, it'd be \ngreat to have both high production values *and* a truthful, \nspiritually-uplifting message consistent with God's worldview; but since \ntheir budget is limited and we couldn't have both, I know which aspect I \nplace the most value on.\n\n*\"No matter the message it represents, the execution is so poor that the \nmessage is lost in the process.\"*\n\nIt wasn't lost to me; and neither would I suspect it was lost to the \nmajority of committed, mature Christians who watched it.\n\n*\" A rose on a turd might still be a rose, but dame[sic] if people going to \npick it up and smell it.\"*\n\nAgreed. Only for the majority of Hollywood movies (unlike GND), the \"rose\" \nis the multi-million dollar \"production values\" and the \"turd\" is the story \nitself. To evaluate a movie so highly on production values while ignoring \nthe actual underlying message of the story is analogous to a kid receiving \na brand new, shiny bicycle for Christmas and ignoring it in favor of the \nwrapping paper and box it came in."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg8BIVZ5xdwczWLSGu6Pymw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "KevvlFan", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13rebrpukyviloyn04cizyjyvf0gh0wi0o", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-27T17:19:28.837Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCg8BIVZ5xdwczWLSGu6Pymw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.30310999999999999, "formal_score": 73, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-27T17:19:28.837Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116202848021024855323", "textDisplay": "+ThatClassic70sGirl\nChristian can't use profanity?

Goes to show how lowly they \nthought of the people seeing their movie.\n\nAlso, the movie was being backed by anti gay hate groups like the American \nFamily Association and the person the Muslim lady was listening to was \nFranklin Graham, who has voiced approval for the anti gay laws in Russia. \nSo if issues like homosexuality were brought up in the movie, I wouldn't be \nsurprised if the gay characters were portrayed as lustful sinners that just \nwant to destroy families.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13xtxkbqtetgj3go04cjlcaikbisphzyzk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfVfJ8thBWCIJp14DXKdsWQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 2.7027027027027026, "authorDisplayName": "Harold Tecson", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-14T13:10:11.247Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfVfJ8thBWCIJp14DXKdsWQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.88623830000000003, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2015-07-14T13:10:11.247Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103092547736888433172", "textDisplay": "Honestly, you are one, stupid piece of shit.

Yeah, I agree, most of the technicals, the \nediting, the music, the acting (I still liked some of the acting), are not \nthat great, but I don't think it's entirely the faults of the makers, \ncause' if you have a type of film that that normally does not get a lot of \nmedia coverage in the theatrical mainstream, then you're film will not have \nas big a budget, and you'll have a harder time getting better actors, \neditors, directors, writers, the works. This is not an argument on the \npoints, viewpoints, or story of the movie, just that, maybe the technicals \nof this film could be excusable.\n\nI mean no offense towards Ralph or anyone else, I liked this video, \nactually.

Probably it is strung out some number of \nposts back, because you are so adept at ignoring the obvious and taking \nthings out-of-context, I can only address one of your questions/issues at a \ntime, you get things so tangled up. It was not my intention to ignore any \ntopic or question, it's just that to try and deal with them all in a single \npost, in a similar manner as how you present them would be excessively \ntime-consuming and take a prohibitive amount of space. You already \ncommented on the length of my last \"rant\" implying that it was almost too \nlong to bother reading; and then chastise me for not addressing multiple \nissues within the same post?\nMake your mind up.\n\n*\">Just gotta love how everything you say makes the man the villain and the \nwoman the poor unsuspecting victim.\"*\n\nOf course! That's self-evident in the etymology: \"male\" = *mal* (\"evil\"). \n:-P\n\nRelax, I'm just kidding! But seriously, I think you're ignoring some \nobvious, non-controvertible facts of history and biology here. I'm going to \nfirst respond to this objection combined with Question #2, because they \nboth deal with the \"fairness\" issue and the natural order of things \nregarding male-female sexuality and relationships; while Question #1, while \nnot irrelevant is a separate issue which I will deal with in a later, \nseparate post.\n\n*\"Is that gender equality? Oh, wait, I forgot you were religious, so you \ndon't believe in gender equality...\"*\n\nYou are correct on that, but only in that I am not a feminist, and never \nwill be\u2014or at least in the sense that it is defined and practiced nowadays. \nI believe that the Bible has made valid, non-negotiable distinctions \nbetween the roles of men and women. God presents Himself in His Word as \nbeing male; and I personally have no problem with that. I'm not arguing \nthis point, as I know you don't (and wouldn't) agree. I'm not out to \nconvince you on this. I'm just explaining my own vantage point and why I \nhold it. \nGod gave to Adam (and his male descendants) both the right and ultimate \nresponsibility (it is mostly responsibility) of leadership and \ndecision-making in the home, place of worship and government/society at \nlarge. It would be a source of conflict if they had one and not the \nother(s); which is incidentally why I am skeptical of women ministers \n(they're usually of a more liberal theological bent on other important \nmoral issues, anyway).\nAnyway the established order is that the husband/father is to exercise \nstewardship over his home and family, the women and children being \nanswerable to him (with children in turn being answerable to their \nmothers); while he is responsible *directly to God* for the way he \nexercises that leadership. Neither gender is given a \"free pass\" to act \nselfishly, irresponsibly or mistreat others due to their relative position. \nAlthough woman is subordinate to man, it is only in a technical sense; \nsimilar to how Christ as subordinate made Himself voluntarily subject to \nthe will of God the Father. Both men and women are equal in the spiritual \nsense before God (\"heirs together of the grace of life\" -1 Peter 3:7). \n\"Rights\" and \"equality\" are only tangible concepts (however valid or \ninvalid) in the face of sin; because without mankind's (both male and \nfemale) sinful failings, there would be absolutely no need for anyone to \nassert them (Ephesians 5; Colossians 3; Philippians 2:3-11; 1 Corinthians \n9).\n\nBut getting back to the main issue at hand, you wrote:\n\n_>\"Just gotta love how everything you say makes the man the villain and the \nwoman the poor unsuspecting victim [...] [W]hat if the male doesn't want a \nchild, and offers to pay for everything, including abortion, medical care \nand psychological counseling; he just doesn't feel ready to take the \ncommitment of raising a child in his teen years; but the god-fearing girl \nsays \"no, it's my body and I'm having this child\"; and he has to pay child \nsupport for the next 18 years. Is that fair? A woman can choose to \ninterrupt a pregnancy regardless of the\nfather's desire to have a child or not, without any legal consequence, but \nif a man doesn't want the child, he's forced to contribute to its care \nuntil adulthood. Does that seem fair to you?\"_\n\nMy short answer to this is \"no\". It is not fair. Nothing about this \nsituation is (or will be) \"fair\" or advantageous to either party; or at \nleast in the long run. Neither did I intend to imply that the girl is \nentirely innocent in the affair (no pun intended)\u2014not by a long shot. \nWomen's inherent weakness is their desire to usurp male authority/power; \nwhich they often do through sexual seduction, which in turn is the male's \ninherent weakness. Because once you have given yourself to her outside of \nmarriage, she feels as though you are her possession and she wants to \ncontrol you. In marriage these kinds of obligations and invisible \"ties\" \nmake sense\u2014you both love one another and are committed to the relationship \n(along with any children that might result). You are both \"one\" in spirit \nand soul, as well as flesh. Outside of its mutually-protective enclave, \nhowever, it just brings bondage (spiritual, emotional, physical and \nfinancial) to both parties.\n\nGetting back to the \"non-controvertibles,\" however, do you deny that the \nmale sex drive is (generally, *on average*) stronger than the female's? \nUntil less than, oh say about half a century ago (before the explicit \ncultural reconditioning of the \"sexual revolution\" swept through the \nmainstream media and entertainment industry), going back to our \nhypothetical teenage sweethearts, which of the two were more likely to \npressure the other \"god-fearing\" one into having sex? Which of the two were \nmore likely to use emotional manipulation and lead the other into thinking \nthat they were more emotionally committed to the relationship than they \nwere, in order to encourage the more reluctant one to overcome their \nnatural inhibitions, make illogical rationalizations based on fickle \nemotion, and compromise their moral standards? Which of the two could \nactually be physically forced to participate in sexual intercourse against \ntheir will?\n\nWhile I would sincerely question whether \"psychological counseling\" would \nprovide any lasting solution to the deep-seated sense of loss and guilt \n(some of which might not surface until years later) a would-be mother would \nexperience in the wake of an abortion, I would propose that both of them \nhave the responsibility of choosing to protect themselves\u2014and the one they \nproclaim to \"love\"\u2014by choosing the more self-sacrificial, truly mature path \nof not engaging in intercourse during their formative teen years in the \nfirst place.\n\nThere is also the biological realities of pregnancy. A judge can issue a \ncourt-order, mandating that a male pay child support for his own biological \nissue. But short of the legal system (and what pitiful little is left of \nsocial constraints), there is nothing inherently mandating that a male take \nany responsibility, involvement, or even acknowledge the child he has \nillegitimately fathered. Even with a court order, he can technically choose \nto go to jail or remain unemployed rather than pay (if he's that spiteful).\n\nThe girl, however, has absolutely no choice. By that, I mean the pregnancy \nbeing in her body, she can't just \"walk away\" from the problem. Either she \ncarries the baby, gives it up for adoption, keeps it, or has an \nabortion--short of an early, spontaneous miscarriage, that pregnancy WILL \nrun it's course one way or other and change her life, for better or worse. \nShe can't just ignore it and hope it goes away. It's going to negatively \naffect her body for the duration, and most likely permanently afterwards as \nwell, regardless of the course of action she takes. She might've only \ngotten one lousy orgasm (or none at all) out of the deal, while her \nex-boyfriend has meanwhile moved on to his next flame; but now she is \npaying for that (in one way or other) for the rest of her life. All because \n(at the heart of it) an immature boy (not a man, because a real man would \nnot put someone he claims to care about in this position) threw \nself-control to the winds, took advantage of a situation and pressured her \ninto something she really didn't want to do.\n\nI ask you, is *that* fair?\n(cont.)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl-B5aD-3IdqGtGeP_-8OsQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.58479532163742687, "authorDisplayName": "mihaitha", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z123etkohrj3gznws04cjplyftjtdzfg5ig", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-17T21:10:19.429Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCl-B5aD-3IdqGtGeP_-8OsQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.86895159999999994, "formal_score": 12, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-17T21:10:19.429Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lxmLQiRZNeA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/Z2w8W00rU_g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105157177136999183570", "textDisplay": "+David Bogdan I got nothing wrong.

OK then, smartypants, please explain to \nme two things (first of which constitutes solely as an argument against \nyour entire rant, the second is simply a moral dilemma):\n\n1. how come the rate of teen pregnancy in the so-called \"bible belt\" (the \nexcessively religious states in the south east area of the US, where \nabstinence is preached as the best form of contraception) is *the highest \nin the civilized world*? If boys and girls are so god-fearing and devout to \nhis laws, please explain how come this is the case.\n\n2. explain to me the fairness and rationality in the following scenario: \nyou said yourself that it takes two to tango; what if the male doesn't want \na child, and offers to pay for everything, including abortion, medical care \nand psychological counseling; he just doesn't feel ready to take the \ncommitment of raising a child in his teen years; but the god-fearing girl \nsays \"no, it's my body and I'm having this child\"; and he has to pay child \nsupport for the next 18 years. Is that fair? A woman can choose to \ninterrupt a pregnancy regardless of the father's desire to have a child or \nnot, without any legal consequence, but if a man doesn't want the child, \nhe's forced to contribute to its care until adulthood. Does that seem fair \nto you? Is that gender equality?

That is basically \nwhat you are saying. To which I have no other possible response than to \nlaugh my ass off, while at the same time shaking my head in disbelief that \nsuck primitive mindsets still exist in 2015 [...] And the atheists are the \nimmoral ones...\"*\n\nIf I wanted to be evasive and deliberately miss the point (as you have done \nmany times during this discussion), I would charge you with poor spelling \nhere for what is an obvious typographical error. But I digress.\n\nOk, mihaitha, like 99+% of atheistic hedonists out there, you think sex is \nlegitimate, moral, right and good just as long as there are two (or perhaps \nmore) parties \"consenting\" to it... So, what happens when the contraception \nfails (as it statistically, inevitably does for two hapless \nfornicators/adulterers somewhere in the world, at any given moment). How is \nthat situation best handled?\nSeems like you need reminding of two likely scenarios. Firstly, since \nthey're not married (and the guy usually is engaging in a bit of emotional \nmanipulation to get his rocks off to begin with), he'll blame his female \npartner for skipping her pills, or otherwise not seeing properly to the \n\"responsibility\" of using birth control. Never mind that it takes two to \ntango; and he's the one who is at the least risk (of paying any physical \nconsequences, anyway) in the relationship. No, clearly the burden of \navoiding unplanned pregnancy should all be the woman's. After all, everyone \nknows that men do not get pregnant.\nEither that, or the classic: suspect his partner is cheating with another \nman. Couldn't possibly be his child. The fact that she had two semi-serious \nrelationships and half a dozen one-night stands prior to him during the \npast two years where she \"effed\" (as you would say it) with other men \nillustrates that fidelity and commitment may not be her strongest character \ntraits. He knows this deep down, despite how loudly he might proclaim and \nsupport the \"sexual liberation\" of women (how *convenient* for him!) among \ntheir mutual friends in public. And as any good atheist committed to a \nhedonistic lifestyle knows, the fact that he chose to willingly and \nknowingly pursue what did not belong to him doesn't factor into the \nquestion of whether he takes any responsibility at all. No, the only thing \nthat matters here as the determinant of moral culpability is the minute \npoint of whether it was actually his sperm (out of however many potential \ntens or hundreds of millions) that fertilized the egg.\nNow, depending on the status of his so-called \"relationship\" with the woman \nin question (casual girlfriend, \"significant other,\" one-night stand, \netc.), and considering that deep down (to varying degrees) he's mainly been \nusing her for sex, he may or may not express these thoughts to her right \naway\u2014or maybe at all. But be assured it always crosses his mind. And \ndepending upon the level of deception and douchebaggery involved, it may be \nhis *prima facie* strategy for quickly extricating himself from the \nunpleasant situation.\nOkay, let's say then he's gone the extra mile and taken a paternity test \n(which comes back positive). Then he'll suggest the next \"easy\" way out \n(abortion). He'll likely offer to pay for the procedure, that is, if his \npartner can't get free assistance from the taxpayers via federal or state \nfunding programs through Planned Parenthood. It helps (at least \ntemporarily) with the deep-seated sense of guilt he feels over the \nsituation whenever he's not actively rationalizing and arguing with his \nconscience. At least this way, he'll be showing *some* semblance of \nresponsibility. Never mind that it will be killing off his child in a \nbrutal, inhumane way that can give his partner nightmares, depression \n(similar to military PTSD) leading to substance abuse and even suicide \nattempts for years to come; and/or put her future fertility at risk due to \na botched procedure.\nProblem is, not all women are so quick to subject themselves to the suction \nmachine. Maybe for whatever reason(s) she doesn't *want* an abortion. \nDepending on how \"serious\" the \"relationship\" is, it may occur to the guy \nthat hey, she deliberately went off the Pill (or whatever) just to try and *trap \nme* into marriage! \"I'll show her!!\" They argue. Hurtful words are \nexchanged; and they split up. Maybe this is just what the guy wanted, maybe \nnot. It depends on his level of self-deception in the situation. Maybe he \nactually thinks he \"loves\" her and/or wants the relationship to continue \nfor a while just to \"see what works out\" between them. He just \"wasn't \nready\" for a kid complicating his life right then. Either way, he doesn't \nwant to be stuck paying child support for the next eighteen years. What to \ndo... what to do...\nSome may attempt to coerce their partner into getting an abortion, under \nthreat of dissolution of the relationship. However in most cases, the man \nends up leaving afterwards anyway, whether the woman aborts or not. The \nresulting stress and guilt over having willingly murdered their child often \ndrives them apart.\n\nLet's take another scenario. Maybe the couple has been \"together\" for a \nyear or more, are getting along well, and the pregnancy is welcomed as \n\"evidence of their love\" and a prelude to marriage. The wedding is \npostponed until after the woman has the baby; or until their next career \npromotion; or until they're making *x-amount* of money; or can afford the \nnew house. Time goes by... and she winds up pregnant again. She wonders why \nhe won't make a commitment. Working full-time and taking care of their kids \nis exhausting her. They argue, first a little, then more often and more \nheatedly. She questions his \"feelings\" for her, while he accuses her of \ntrying to trap him into marriage, or being unfaithful to him with the new \nhandsome office manager down at her job. He starts spending more time away \nfrom home at night \"with the guys,\" to avoid the conflict. She starts being \nsuspicious about his activities: where he is, what he's doing, who he's \nwith, etc. Before they know it, the man has another girlfriend \"on the \nside,\" they've split up (after two, five or even ten years of \n\"cohabiting\"); and the woman is left (hypocritically) wondering what on \nearth she did wrong.\n\nNow of course you'll be quick to point out that similar things can happen \nwhen the couple is legally married, and you'd be correct. However, studies \nhave shown that marriages are more vulnerable to conflict (both physical \nand verbal) and divorce to the degree either or both partners have \ncohabited (or otherwise engaged in sexual immorality) prior to their \nmarriage\u2014even if they later married the same person. This includes \nso-called \"gay\" and transsexual marriages. And there are other consequences \nbesides an unplanned pregnancy that can happen among those who insist on \npracticing polygamy\u2014or serial monogamy, for that matter. Like herpes, HIV \nand AIDS, to name a few. To this date, despite the discoveries and advances \nof your precious god, medical science, condoms are still not 100% \nfoolproof. Far from it, in actual practice. And AIDS has no cure.\n\nSo you just keep on deluding yourself into thinking that what people \n(including yourself) do in their bedrooms is of no one else's business (or \nconsequence) except themselves; or that it's a perfectly amoral, personal \n\"choice\" with no resulting temporal or spiritual ramifications. The truth \nis that *Everyone* pays when the laws of God are ignored and contradicted, \nincluding society at large. And by all means, keep referring to it as \n\"effing\"; because with the erroneous way you define love that's about the \ndegree of selfishness, disdain for others, hatred for God and lack of true \ncommitment/empathy it reflects."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl-B5aD-3IdqGtGeP_-8OsQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.30165912518853694, "authorDisplayName": "mihaitha", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z123etkohrj3gznws04cjplyftjtdzfg5ig", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-17T18:15:32.253Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCl-B5aD-3IdqGtGeP_-8OsQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.41663999999999995, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-17T18:18:48.111Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lxmLQiRZNeA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/Z2w8W00rU_g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105157177136999183570", "textDisplay": "+David Bates\nfirst of all, \"David\" means only \"beloved\".

I \ngrew up in a largely secular household, with a Baptist grandmother a block \naway so my introduction to standard christian protestant religion was an \nongoing process. My parents always encouraged me to think for myself and \ndon't be afraid to ask questions, any question. I grew up a believer in a \ngod, or a close proximity, but never a subscriber to a christian god. I was \nalways interested in the debate and a reader of science, and a proponate of \nlogic. I am a working artists, and understand the importance of symbols and \nmetaphores, I read a lot of mythology and am an avid fan of Joseph \nCampbell, and his writings on comparative religion and mythology. I spend \nnearly two decades involved with American Indian people and their lifeways, \nstudying their material culture and religious beliefs. My personal \nobservations and research into this subject have now come to the conclusion \nthat \"belief\" in a god as described in holy books is irrational and \nantithetical to spirituallity, and damaging to people and society.\n\n     This movie is a prime example of strawmanning a subject and the people \nwho represent that subject, namely by misrepresenting the position, one of \nrejecting a theists proposition of a god described in any or all holy \nbooks. If one cannot argue on the merits of their own position honestly, \nand have to lie about what their opponents position is in order to muster a \ndefense, then they're position is tenious at best.

But, if I must answer these \nquestions, I will. \n\nThe 50/50 thing? It might just be the praying guy's time to go, and the \nAtheist is being given a longer life for the possibility of perhaps seeing \nwhat they didn't before (not that not seeing it makes them evil)\n\nIf you are born into a religion, you are not confined to it. You have your \nchoices, and you can leave if you wish. You cannot believe if you wish. I \nopenly choose to believe, that's my choice, so deal with it.\n\n I'd suppose I wouldn't be here if all Christians died out, so that \nquestion is rather pointless to me. As for passing died-off religions as \nmythology, you can feel free to believe in the world of Percy Jackson if \nyou want. I said simply that nobody saw it as a valid religion anymore \nbecause nobody believed them. But if you want to, go ahead, I won't stop \nyou.\n\n Why need God? If you are telling me that a universe (or possible \nmultiverse) of such seemingly-infinite complexity, where life can evolve \nwith chemicals that only seem simple at first glace and such came about be \naccident, which seems more unlikely at that point. God or \"Random Lucky \nStreak\"?\n\nIf you actually read the Bible to understand it instead of just reading it \nas \"fiction\" or whatever, you'll see I'm not cherry picking. \n\nThe religion-drugs thing? Wow! Maybe in the past you can draw that \ncomparison, but any actual Christian church isn't exactly known for death \nand destruction (Westburrow,  the KKK, and Opus Dei do NOT count as \nChristian) As for other religions, I've heard of very few deadly religions, \nand those that are are being dealt with. Plus, if you take the temporal \nhappiness argument, that may be true for a non-believer, but for religion \nit's different. Drugs bring temporary happiness, religion (if you choose to \nbelieve it, which I do) brings eternal happiness. \n\nI don't believe that the world is 6000 years old, both a stereotype and \ncompletely unbiblical. It says nowhere in the Bible of the world's age, the \nway that early fundamentalists came up with that number was flawed. So, to \nme at least, the 13.7-14 billion years is still an open age. \n\nAs with death. I once heard a philosopher quoted with saying as a Christian \n\"If I'm wrong and you're right, I suffer no consequence. But if I'm right \nand you're wrong...\"\n\nIf there is no God, then everything is permissible. Yes, people can be good \nand kind without God, but what is the point of harmony then if death is \nnothingness? If there is no God, then why be nice and kind, who are you \ntrying to get the attention of? (BTW: Scientists from Princeton recently \nfound that their may be something after death by interviewing around 2000 \npeople who'd been declared legally dead and then brought back).  \nThat word \"coincidentally\", I am not a liar. And why not pray again? \nPerhaps there was a reason behind it all, but how will you know unless you \ntry? \n\nHe only interferes when he NEEDS to, not went you WANT him to. You forget, \nhe is above time. What you want may lead to worse, and he'll see that.  \n\nISIS, holy wars? Way to make out all religious people as extremists. \n\nAt the end of it all, we can go back and forth forever. I have no more \nproof to show you for a creator than you have for me against it. It is a \nbelief I hold, not you. \n\nI will be frank. You may have a sore spot for religion, alright. But I am \nnot a racist, sexist, homophobic extremist. I combine science with what I \nbelieve, and don't accept the 6000 year timeline. So, why place me with all \nother Christians and assume I am as bad as an extremist? If you do that, \nthat's as stupid and insensitive as blaming all Germans for the Holocaust, \nor blaming all Muslims for 9/11. I'm not looking to convert you. I'm \nlooking for equal respect.

As a \nrational thinker I cannot understand why being comfortably deluded is than \nfacing the truth. Are people so terrified of death to the extent of \nthrowing away logic and reasoning? I don't hate gays nor black and I don't \nstone people. If human can be nice without religion then why the need of a \na god? You've coincidentally seen enough to prove Christianity, as for me \ngod never helped me when my life was in a mess. If I didn't stand up by \nmyself but instead kept on praying I'd end up on the street. Why love a sky \ndaddy who never interfere with human's life?

No, it wouldn't. Atheists---at least the vast majority \nof those individuals who claim to be atheists---are far more committed to \ntheir total rejection of the possibility of God than most Christians are to \ntheir faith. I have never met an atheist (and I have met a good number of \nthem) who wasn't far more close-minded than the average Christian.\n\nYou say this is propaganda. To some extent you are undoubtedly correct. But \nthis was never intended to be Star Wars or Gone With The Wind or E.T. or \nTrue Grit. This is a story that speaks directly to those Believers who \nfrequently feel themselves being pushed back into the shadows by an \never-increasing crowd of non-believers who not only don't believe, but are \nincreasingly hostile toward those that do. If you didn't like this film at \nall, that is absolutely your prerogative.

Now we move on to why science \ndoes not include the supernatural. The reason is simple, and I guarantee \nyou, this answer is the truth, but I may not word it well enough. We ignore \nthe hand of the supernatural because it only further complicates the \npremise. For example let's say there's an imbreachable gap in our knowledge \nabout the 4 g forces(I think that's what they're called) and how our \nelectrons are staying at the distance they are from the nucleus of the \natom, and we say \"oh well god did it.\" Then we have to say \"Ok, where is \nthis god, is there any falsifiable evidence? What was his intent? Where did \nhe come from, is he personal active or inactive? Does he look like us?{till \nad nauseam...}\" There was already a period in history where we believed god \nwas the same as science, the dark ages, and it damaged us heavily. To study \nthe existence of a god and how it interacts with the natural world is pure \ninsanity. Pure insanity. You can spend a whole generation of genius minds \nand not even come close, you'd be grasping at air, but these same minds \ndevoted to the natural world could and are making huge progress on current \nunknowns and increasing the quality of human life."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Px4D1FzGkWSHtMCbZclPQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ad lgnorantiam (ItchYaBoii)", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12thztzwuvnyhxot04cjzorlqyjvpcj45k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-11T03:36:06.509Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0Px4D1FzGkWSHtMCbZclPQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.51023599999999991, "formal_score": 83, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-11T03:36:06.509Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sp5mhbK3368/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPw/fmCSNMum16M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106408657484324446810", "textDisplay": "+itslaurenmarie xox You have to understand what it means for a movie to hit \nthe theatres.

We *all* are. The question is *which* bias is the \n*best* bias to be biased *with*.\nWe all have some presuppositions, some source of authority that we accept \nas a given \"starting point\" in our search for information; but ultimately \nthey boil down to the meaning and truth in life. The secular scientist's \nbias is that there is no room for the supernatural or miraculous; and so no \nmatter what it is, it's always got to have another explanation, even if \ntheir experiment or observation is not repeatable and observable (in real \ntime) as according to the scientific method of proof. For example, \nscientific dating methods (carbon-14 and radioactive isotopes) essentially \namount to a tautology; because the assumption that *x* amount of residual \nmolecules = *y* million years on the time scale can never be proven by any \nother known objective measuring scale or device, or perceived through the \nfive senses. In reality, all dating methods, including those that point to \na young Earth, rely on many assumptions, because in the end they are closed \nsystems.\nBut I'm not here to debate evolution vs. creation with you, or anyone else \nwho is a devotee of sites such as talkorigins. I honestly don't recall the \nmovie presenting (or even implying) that the Muslim father's \"sole purpose\" \nin life was to prevent his daughter from learning about Christianity. Where \ndid you get *that* from? If you watched the entire film, you would see \nwhere he was emotionally and spiritually conflicted after throwing his \ndaughter out of their house. He obviously loves his family; but being being \nborn into and preconditioned (likely from his boyhood) by a harsh \nauthoritarian, misogynistic religious system which has rejected Christ's \nsacrifice and atonement for sin has impeded his ability to relate to his \nfamily in a more diplomatic, authoriTATIVEly loving way.\nSame for the atheistic professor. As another Christian once posted on these \ndiscussion boards, atheists want to totally discount the metaphysical in \ntheir search for truth and life's meaning. The loss of his mother to cancer \nduring his own childhood would've had a profound effect upon him, even if \nhe were (subsequently still) raised in a Christian home. As an unbeliever, \nhis vision and search for fulfillment in life is limited to the confines of \nthis earthly sphere and existence. He was bound to experience the \ninequitable injustice, the inherent *meaninglessness* of it, as it had no \npower to transcend death or even give any ultimate significance to the \nyears he was wasting away in spiritual and emotional isolation."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkyZDAALo3VUtpUqQGDXnRw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "The Dude", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12thztzwuvnyhxot04cjzorlqyjvpcj45k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-15T02:06:07.183Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkyZDAALo3VUtpUqQGDXnRw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.77346399999999993, "formal_score": 54, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-15T02:06:07.183Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xJ1P5IMzCzA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADc/On5M6KoSIEM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104015194567045526677", "textDisplay": "+ThatClassic70sGirl  There is absolutely zero presumption in regards to \nthis film being propaganda.   *ZERO*  If you can't see that then you're \nalready viewing the film from a slanted perspective; therefore, any \nanalysis you provide is slanted as well.\n\nAs for the lying, it's creating *STRAWMEN ARGUMENTS*  \n\n - the mad at god atheist\n\n - the authoritative muslim father, who's sole purpose is to prevent his \ndaughter from hearing about the evil christians\n\n*HONESTLY*, if you can't see these as strawman arguments....then I'd like \nto reference my first paragraph."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO16__ktPacw-yEC-9xVJeQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ThatClassic70sGirl", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12thztzwuvnyhxot04cjzorlqyjvpcj45k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-15T01:53:23.503Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCO16__ktPacw-yEC-9xVJeQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.58749600000000002, "formal_score": 30, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-15T01:53:23.503Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101204485940532276846", "textDisplay": "+The Dude - You're presuming at least two things here: a) that the film is \npropaganda; and b) that it is lying to suggest that proponents of other \nreligions sometimes resort to physical abuse when a family member professes \nfaith in Christ.

Well, I'm not gonna to force you \nor anything, I just wanna stay cool with people. Plus it would be \npointless. But i will encourage you and i'd like to tell about my story. \nsorry if my response is long-ish... Yeah, it's pretty hard to believe that \nthere is a god. In a world full of lies and untrusted people, you'd really \nwant people to give physical evidences to prove the existence of a god. \nWere you Christian or Catholic? Well I grew up as a catholic but away from \nchurch. my family wasn't really close to God. I've NEVER been to a church \nwith my ENTIRE family. i guess you can say that we were like atheists. we \ndidn't really cared about God. We'd just do the sign of the cross and junk \nwhen people say so. ... My family was full of hatred. Favoritism, lies, \ncheats, an uncle who everyone thinks stole from my mother, and a little \ngirl whose parents are married to different people. It's sick and \nirritating you know? being related to very sinful people, you'd have a hard \ntime trying to find a way to love them (they're humorous, i'll give them \nthat.) i even thought about suicide a few times. .. then one day, my mom \ndecided i join a catholic church to sing with the chorale. It was more of \nimproving my voice actually, not really to serve God. during church, i \nthought most of the things priests' said were nonsense and that some of the \nthings they taught shouldn't have been taken literally, and vice versa. i \nalso humiliated myself by forgetting what to say in the middle of a Hail \nMary in the rosary. I didn't even like doing the rosary. but i did talk to \nGod more. i finally became happy because of Him. He made me smile for real, \nfor the first time in a while. I considered little happy things as \nmiracles. But every once in a while i'd forget about Him, so obviously, \nbeing catholic wasn't enough. .. soon i realized my parents were fighting. \nthey talked to each other less but whenever they did talk, it was obvious \nthat they were arguing. As the eldest child in our little family, I knew \nwhat their movements meant. One day i heard myself tell mother \"it's ok \nmum, just pray. God will help us\" or something like that. She actually took \nthe advice and did pray. then she looked for psychiatrists or therapists or \nwhatever, i dunno. then someone told her about Christianity, she decided to \ntry it out and she liked it. Soon we were attending christian churches and \nour lives have improved. except for my dad. he's more of a magik & sorcery \nguy. he thinks that we are all our own god & we have the potential to be \nGod and there are times when my parents still won't get along. he's the \nonly one i'm waiting for in our church, but i believe everything is in \nprogress. especially my father's heart. God is working on my father's \nheart... these days, my mom attends a Discipleship group every Thursday in \nthe city of Ortigas, which is about 2 hours away from where we live. A \nDiscipleship group or d-group is a group of people lead by a mentor or \ndiscipler, like Jesus and His 12 Disciples. Teaching about God and the \nBible. It's an exhausting and sometimes expensive trip, but it's fun and \nworth it, haha. you learn a lot of things about God and His unconditional \nLove for us. turns out a lot of Filipino celebrities are Christians and \nsome are considering to join my mom's Dgroup (really excited about that \nxD). I met a lot of people who are related/friends with famous people. one \nwoman in this group has a (ex)husband who was famous in the Philippines for \na while... for lies and rape. i think he just got out of prison :P we're \npraying for him anyway. .. my mother and i like to think that God is \nproviding for us. one time, mom was trying to decide if we should take a \ntrain or a bus to go there. she felt that we should take the bus so we did. \nwhen we arrived Ortigas, my mom's Dgroupmates said that the train we ALMOST \nused was hit by another train. And the train that hit it won't stop running \n:O It was all on the news. just about everyone there was injured. that \nnight I realized that God was protecting us. .. A few weeks later, after \ntalking about money problems, mom and i accidentally rode the wrong bus. \nTHAT bus took us to Ortigas in a fast, safer, and less expensive way. mom \nwas really amazed xD God really was providing for us. we also attend a BSF \n(bible study fellowship) every Monday. it's cool actually, you learn new \nstuff and actually understand the super complicated and mysterious (for me) \nBible. BSF is also the place where mom met someone who found a job for her. \ni don't think this was all just a coincidence. and like i said, everything \nis still in progress. .. I can tell you a lot more, but Youtube is not a \ngood place to talk about these haha. i hope this helped :/ I admit it, \nthere are times when I think \u201cwhat if God doesn't exist? And if He doesn't \nexist, what happens if I continue spending my life, running after something \nthat never existed?\u201d it's just doubting you know. Some things we really \njust have to be faithful about. It can be hard, I know, but at least we \nhave something to believe in, and it keeps us thinking that we were put on \nthis earth for a reason. That we are actually loved.\n\n(i'm sorry, this is so long xD)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpDS4MsuzSwMzjHgmXrQMw", "inappropriate_score": 0.21063717746182201, "authorDisplayName": "Xavier Quincy Zayden", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12etpfhtuyyxpisr22atlz5ir22zj0e1", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-31T03:38:55.420Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjpDS4MsuzSwMzjHgmXrQMw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.36709400000000003, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-31T03:43:47.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9xK5RcCXisE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJk/XD_ijkgYBZQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100632322571505859297", "textDisplay": "+Lara Pascual *facepalm*\nI don't understand why believers think something negative has to happen to \nus to make us lose our faith. Whatever, I might as well start from the \nbeginning.\nI was practically raised in a church, like many in America. The only \ndifference was I never liked going, I didn't want to go, but I didn't have \na choice. Hell, many of my friends from then and now have said they never \nliked going to church and that they wouldn't if they had the choice. It \nwasn't until recently that I finally admitted to myself that I never really \nbelieved in any of the things I was taught there. It should have been \nobvious to me, because I always asked questions and I always wanted a \nstraight forward factual answer. I knew that people didn't just rise from \nthe dead, I knew that there wasn't enough water on earth for it to flood \nhigher than Mt. Everest, and I knew the earth wasn't flat and that the \nuniverse was just a glass dome with dots on it a few hundred feet off the \nground. The answers I would get were never satisfactory, usually \"it's all \nin the bible\", but more often I was told not to question it or that I just \nhad to \"take it all on faith\", a concept I was never really contempt with. \nI actually would read the bible, read more than just the cherry picked \nquotes they hammered into our heads, and usually found some very \ndisconcerting context being left out. The only reason I kept going in my \nteens after my dad left (the one who forced me to go) was because I \nactually had friends there, which was more than I could say about any other \nfacet of my life at the time. It wasn't until I was seven when I decided to \nbe honest with myself and admit I didn't believe in anything they told me, \nand it wasn't until I was 14 when I started admitting it to others. I'm \nstill friends with some of the people I met in church, but I soon stopped \ngoing because I found time to be with them outside. I never really called \nmyself an atheist, despite being one, until I started researching \nchristianity and most other major religions in depth late in my freshmen \nyear of high school. I found all these faiths unbelievable, and after \nfinding out about how many religiously backed atrocities there were \nthroughout the centuries, I said, \"There's no way I'm ever going back to \nthis delusional nonsense\". I would not at all be as outspoken about my \natheism if I hadn't done my research and found out about all the violence \nand repression. People always tell me that my seven octave vocal range is a \n\"gift from god\", and to be honest, I'm highly offended by it, because I \nknow full well that it was my work with my voice that got me this range, \nnot some magical sky wizard. If I had no interest in singing or (voice) \nacting, I would have little to no range at all. Granted, I'd still have an \nawesome, rumble-y low voice, but it wouldn't be the same as being able to \nsing almost any song or impersonate any character voice. So yeah, I'm \nobviously going to be ridiculously offended when people attribute my hard \nwork and determination to an ethereal omnipotent sky daddy, but that's \nabout as far as experiences go when it comes to pushing me away from \nreligion. I've never really been a target of ridicule aside from some \nuncomfortable dinner conversations with family members, and the only other \nthing really upsetting about my character aside from be being an outspoken \nand brutally honest prick at times is the fact that I'm pansexual, which \nhas never really been an issue given that I prefer women, leading most to \nassume I'm straight. Hell, I only ever though I was simply bisexual until \nabout a year ago, because I knew from a young age that I was attracted to \nboth sexes, but found out I wasn't just bi after my friend sent me a link \nto some yuri hentai site containing shemale sex as a joke for my birthday. \nI discovered that I like girls with penises. I know this is a bit \nunnecessarily detailed and personal, but when I ventured through this site \nand even some live action pornography, and after an unfortunate viewing of \ntentacle fetish porn (disturbed and intrigued me in a very unnerving way), \nI realized I was actually pansexual. I'm willing to admit it and I don't \ncare who knows.\nBack on topic, I think I've covered just about everything. Never had faith, \nnever had a reason to believe in a deity, and I'm completely comfortable \nsaying that god does not exist until someone can provide me with evidence \nsaying otherwise. That's pretty much it. None of my personal experiences \noutside of anything related to religion/theism were linked in any way, \nthough I didn't exactly have the greatest childhood, I still never \nattributed anything going on in my personal life to god. There were select \nmoments when I may have thought things like, \"Why would a god let this \nhappen (to me)?\", but never really made a habit out of it or took it to \nheart. God and my personal life have pretty much been completely separate \nfrom each other, not really any correlation between the two.\nOkay, I'm done now."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0kYkgj34sKmonXH9TvsVEw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Lara Pascual (G.P.)", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12etpfhtuyyxpisr22atlz5ir22zj0e1", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-30T04:13:42.656Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0kYkgj34sKmonXH9TvsVEw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.35855400000000004, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-30T04:13:42.656Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z0xtk0-qUJc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABTA/OXb8HP08D5g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116346367070026972487", "textDisplay": "oh alright... kewl\n+There Is NO God can I ask if something happened?

They are all \ncaricatures of their real counterparts. Many brilliant minds have put \nforward great theological arguments throughout history, and they intended \nto demonstrate the existence of God one way or another (some of the most \nfamous people who proposed them are figures like Saint Anselm, Saint Thomas \nAquinas, Avicena, Al Farabi etc.) The arguments can be discussed rationally \nand they are still pretty important today. Even logical positivism has \nabandoned it's early intention to destroy metaphysical discourse and is now \nplaying with theological ideas. Atheists have their own arguments, of \ncourse, and it's always stimulating to discuss ideas... But this movie is \njust dumb. If you want to defend theism read someone like Frederick \nCopleston or watch an intelligent movie about the subject, but this \nspecific film constitutes a terrible ground to defend your position. The \nstudent and the professor use too many logical fallacies, and that fact \nmakes it impossible to take any of the things they say seriously.   \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8wmAEbOs3U-UA6vwfSigpQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Alex Damiano", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qcvpzromqubg5h04chh2yqyngffowid4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-02T08:09:32.444Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8wmAEbOs3U-UA6vwfSigpQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.50079600000000002, "formal_score": 69, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-01-02T08:09:32.444Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n4t_ug2huz8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMc/tdhuLIVv8rs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109114935811898526725", "textDisplay": "Very well said.

This is my \nway of giving you the benefit of the doubt.  After watching the movie  5 \ntimes and watching you criticize it, you are surely not understanding the \npurpose of this movie .  The movie is not one sided, he even mentions that \nGod gives us free will.,  But this movie was not made as entertainment. \n Even you should know that.  It was made as a ministry and so of course \n its going to be about receiving Christ all through the movie, but yes, we \ndo have free choice, its just that Christians don't want people like \nyourself to make the wrong choice, so yes, sometimes we desperately try to \nwin souls for Christ.  If you were in a burning building , I would try to \npull you out at even the risk of my own life, as I have done before, but it \nwould not matter if you were a Christian or not.

Religious \norganizations still have plenty of ability to censor the content of \nmany movies.  They not only order their fellow religionists not to see \nmovies, they call for boycotts of theaters and sometimes religious \nfanatics even threaten to bomb theaters.

Yet the results were pure \njunk and many conservative Christians stayed away from the theaters in \ndroves because of the way Aronofsky chose to butcher, disregard and \nmisrepresent the original biblical account.

Now, you can argue that what he believes and promotes in his spare \ntime off-campus is irrelevant to this incident. But it *does* indicate an \nextreme anti-religious bias on the professor's part which most likely came \ninto play when he drafted his examination papers, as subsequently evidenced \nby his presumptuous assertions (within the essay questions) that \nChristianity along with all other religious faiths were misogynistic myths. \nIt's similar to the veterinarian down in Texas who lost her medical license \ndue to posting a photo on her Facebook account of a cat she'd deliberately \nand gratuitously killed with a bow-and-arrow. The Texas state veterinary \nboard's decision is presently under appeal; but the premise is that when \ndealing with the public, attitudes and beliefs do count.\n\nralphthemoviemaker can \"[propose] an unbiased argument\" based on religion \n(as you stated) all he wants.

He supposedly did \nthis to end slavery, but in Exodus 21:1-11, in which God even establishes \nthe parental trade of their Israelite daughters and sons. He just freed \nslaves, allegedly, but makes more afterward? What kind of fucked up \nmorality is that? Oh and Jesus never ended this practice! In Ephsians \n6:5-6, Paul speaks to slaves and tells them to continue serving their \nMasters. Paul continues to say in 1 Timothy 6:1 that slaves should give \nglory to their masters. Pretty fucked up morality there, too. God tells \nIsrael not to kill in Exodus 20:13, but he orders genocide in the OT \nagainst multiple civilizations or kills them in favor of the Israelites (so \nmuch for the NT claim that their is no partiality with God). Bible scholar \nRaymond Schwager said, \"...has found 600 passages of explicit violence in \nthe Hebrew Bible (your OT), 1,000 verses where God's own violent action of \npunishment are described, 100 passages (passages are multiple verses \nconsecutively) where God expressly commands others to kill people, and \nseveral stories where God kills for no apparent reason. Violence... is \neasily the most actively mentioned activity n the Hebrew Bible.\" (G. \nDoubleday. \"The Powers That Be: Theology for a New Millenium\" 1998)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC31qUxqfyp870l0FH9U6xXg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "WolfmanVsVampire", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12ltboj4syotvg4f04cdleakxj2vpjrfuc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-07T03:53:35.967Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC31qUxqfyp870l0FH9U6xXg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.61887200000000009, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-01-07T03:53:35.967Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zrpQZOXAXtU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/CvhL5HJrY6c/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111751786361398606200", "textDisplay": "+Joshua Ciresoli Probably wouldn't matter with these guys.

This presents no major problem with \ntheir authority or accuracy. Passing on oral traditions and teachings was \ncommonplace in the Jewish culture of that day, and memorization was highly \ncultivated and practiced. Also, the fact that even at that time there would \nhave been a considerable number of eyewitnesses around to dispute and \ndiscredit any false claims, and the fact that none of the \u201chard sayings\u201d of \nJesus were taken from the Gospel accounts, further supports their accuracy. \nHad the Gospels been edited before being written down, as some liberal \nscholars contend, then it was a very poor job. The writers left far too \nmany \u201chard sayings,\u201d and culturally unacceptable and politically incorrect \naccounts that would need explaining. An example of this is that the first \nwitnesses of the resurrection were women, who were not considered reliable \nwitnesses in the culture of that day.So, whether it was few years or many \nafter Jesus\u2019 death that the Gospels were written, we can have total \nconfidence and faith in their completeness and accuracy, knowing that they \nwere written by \u201cmen moved by the Holy Spirit\u201d (2 Peter 1:21), who \naccurately recorded the very words of God.\nThe fact is that the Bible has not been rewritten. Take the New Testament, \nfor example. The disciples of Jesus wrote the New Testament in Greek, and \nthough we do not have the original documents, we do have around 6,000 \ncopies of the Greek manuscripts that were made very close to the time of \nthe originals. These various manuscripts, or copies, agree with each other \nto almost 100 percent accuracy. Statistically, the New Testament is 99.5% \ntextually pure. That means that there is only 1/2 of one percent of all the \ncopies that do not agree with each other perfectly. But, if you take that \n1/2 of one percent and examine it, you find that the majority of the \n\"problems\" are nothing more than spelling errors and very minor word \nalterations. For example, instead of saying \"Jesus,\" a variation might be \n\"Jesus Christ.\" So the actual amount of textual variation of any concern is \nextremely low. Therefore, we can say that we have a remarkably accurate \ncompilation of the original documents.\n\nSo when the Bible has been translated, it is not translated from a \ntranslation of a translation of a translation. It is translated from the \noriginal languages into our language. It is a one-step process and not a \nseries of steps that can lead to corruption. It is one translation step \nfrom the original to the English or to other languages. So the Bible has \nbeen translated into Spanish or German or Chinese from the same Greek and \nHebrew manuscripts. This is how it is done for each and every language into \nwhich we translate the Bible. We do not translate from the original \nlanguages to the English, to the Spanish, and then to the German. It is \nfrom the original languages to the English or into the Spanish or into the \nGerman. Therefore, the translations are very accurate and trustworthy.\n\n"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS4Ly9_01JTE28M7yiKb-Uw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "FeRnando Ramirez", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cynsgrvzhsxkd223evhyqlpn1exlua", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-27T23:56:37.865Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCS4Ly9_01JTE28M7yiKb-Uw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0011719999999999509, "formal_score": 60, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-27T23:56:37.865Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AvjFpR0BWMw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/8HYY0xX9vAE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106585978574860540949", "textDisplay": "All the stuff you claim *history* came from a book translated several times \n(subject to translation errors), modified a lot of times (subject to \nmisconceptions or convenient alterations that a lot of cruel people made), \nand also *it was wrote 30-40 years after \"said Jesus's death\", which is \nsubject to lack of accuracy in the tales* (And btw, Jesus has not precise \nhistoricity by the way, look it up).\nSo go ahead, claim Satan shut my eyes hahahaha but respectfully, yours seem \nto be shut from way before."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7U-3Wkb-ypiin1iSI9wenA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Lindsey Ussery", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cynsgrvzhsxkd223evhyqlpn1exlua", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-27T22:21:25.467Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7U-3Wkb-ypiin1iSI9wenA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.52008399999999999, "formal_score": 49, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-27T22:21:25.467Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mFVtQBBdo3s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAClk/kV1oZs14jhs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109575438740988877171", "textDisplay": "+FeRnando Ramirez nope.

Jesus himself treated the whole Old \nTestament as God\u2019s word (eg Mt 12:1-14, 19:4, 5:17-20).\n\nIn Genesis 32:30, Jacob saw God appearing as a man; he did not truly see \nGod. Samson\u2019s parents were terrified when they realized they had seen God \n(Judges 13:22), but they had only seen Him appearing as an angel. Jesus was \nGod in the flesh (John 1:1, 14) so when people saw Him, they were seeing \nGod. So, yes, God can be \u201cseen\u201d and many people have \u201cseen\u201d God. At the \nsame time, no one has ever seen God revealed in all His glory. In our \nfallen human condition, if God were to fully reveal Himself to us, we would \nbe consumed and destroyed. Therefore, God veils Himself and appears in \nforms in which we can \u201csee\u201d Him. However, this is different than seeing God \nwith all His glory and holiness displayed.

All of that which you claim, is inside the readings of an old \ntext written about 30 years after the death and \"resurrection\" of the \nperson your claims rotate about; whom I will add, there are very scarce \nsources of historicity for his actual existence (Look the meaning of \nhistoricity up, because you seem to have lost your dictionary). Also, the \ntext which you refer to was translated many times, edited many times for \nphilosophical differences and purposes (hence so many christianity derived \nreligions), and also for convenience.\n\nIf your claims that come from an old book have to be taken for truth \nbecause of its age, then I can say and claim the same things from The \nOdyssey, The Iliad, The Epic of Gilgamesh (One of the oldest if not the \noldest texts in the world) all the same.\n\nIf your claims that come from a book that has been translated and edited \nmany many times because it's the word of God, then I will ask, why did all \nof these events take place in the same area? (as the Qu'ran and Torah by \nthe way), how is this book/religion special? (Which is not, because it not \nthe only one. And saying the others are wrong does not automatically make \nyou right). Also, I will add, that not all languages are spoken/written the \nsame way, so when the Bible was translated, it must have been translating \nerros. Noting that ancient Hebrew (the language in which the first biblical \ntexts were written in) was an alphabet without vowels, and yet not entirely \nunderstood. Linguistics is a very interesting field.\n\nThe idea of a creator is not bad. We are aware of cause and effect, yes. \nBut saying that something was created because it had to, therefore it was \nGod, is not an answer, it's still a claim. If you claim that something is \ncomplex and therefore is created, then the creator itself must be complex, \nand if the creator is complex, than who created the creator? And if you \nbelieve in a self-created supernatural being, there's no reason why a \nself-created universe doesn't makes sense, it actually makes more sense.\n\nScience has not been able to explain it all, but it's in process \n*empirically* and it doesn't jump to conclusions. Don't stay sitting with a \n\"I know there is a God\" because all you claim to know about the matter, \ncame from that book. If it makes you feel better, fine, but that's not a \nreason to be uneducated."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS4Ly9_01JTE28M7yiKb-Uw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "FeRnando Ramirez", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cynsgrvzhsxkd223evhyqlpn1exlua", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-15T06:14:04.428Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCS4Ly9_01JTE28M7yiKb-Uw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.91028980000000004, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-15T06:14:04.428Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AvjFpR0BWMw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/8HYY0xX9vAE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106585978574860540949", "textDisplay": "Woops, my bad.

And that will not be a happy moment for him, to \nknow that he has mocked God and taken his Holy Name in vain.\n\nDavid, if you are reading this- there is still time. \n\nIf you leave this mortal plain without having accepted God's love David, \nthen you won't be happy where you are headed. I know you are caught up in \nthe Unicorn Devil's lies, and its hard to see through.\n\nBut I believe in you David. I've prayed for you every night these last few \nmonths, and I know God loves you as much as any other of his children.\n\nAccept him as much as he accepts you, and you will be free. \n\nBut for now guys we ought to praise God, and give thankfulness for all he \nhas given us. There's no need to let the sinners of the world screw our \nperspective of just how beautiful and magnificent the blessings that He has \ngiven us truly are. \n\nI look forward eagerly to seeing you all in the Unicorn Heaven. Stay \nstrong, embrace truth, and never give up hope, for God's grace is infinite \nand eternal, and his love for you is unconditional. Maybe one day David \nwill see that as well, instead of embracing the perverted ideas of men and \nworshiping a false \"god\" (Really he worships Satan)"}}]}, "z13mvhpw3umqsnds522dstoz2oylsnr3e": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 4, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg8BIVZ5xdwczWLSGu6Pymw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "KevvlFan", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-19T07:16:33.644Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCg8BIVZ5xdwczWLSGu6Pymw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.23660400000000004, "formal_score": 21, "updatedAt": "2015-10-19T07:16:33.644Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116202848021024855323", "textDisplay": "I love how most people here just wants to come here and shout their opinion \non the top of their lungs and then disable comment to prevent people from \nreplying .\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg8BIVZ5xdwczWLSGu6Pymw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "KevvlFan", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mvhpw3umqsnds522dstoz2oylsnr3e", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-27T18:32:50.750Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCg8BIVZ5xdwczWLSGu6Pymw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.84354189999999996, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-27T18:32:50.750Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116202848021024855323", "textDisplay": "+ThatClassic70sGirl\nAnd which side am I on?

Using the example \nin the movie, when the lady is suppose to feel the dread and emotional \ntorment of being diagnose with cancer and to face the possibilities of \ndeath, she howled quite loudly and cry in a overly dramatic way. To present \nthis in a more human way would to allows a little bit more time to build \nthe tension and when she does break out in tears, make her appears to be \nfallen in angry and depress state.\nI would suggest swiping the computer ( Only slightly, not punched) off the \ndesk and begin to break down and cry. (possibly tearing at her hair a \nlittle, not too much. Holding head with both hands would also works)\nOne important thing to do is to NEVER assume that screaming at the air is \ngood way to convey emotion. It would be better if she scream while holding \nher face. Fetal position is actually a very good way to convey emotional \ndistress. Have her slightly holding her face while curl up slightly would \nwork great.\n\nOne other thing I've noticed is that she tries to \"sniffle\", that does not \ndo what she intended to do.

Everyone's free to have their own \nreligion. I'm a Christian and it's the best decision I ever made, and I \nloved this movie. The thing is Joshua in the movie explains that you can't \nprove unseen things, and that's why it's called FAITH, so there's no reason \nto get offended. You can, however, use evidence. Honestly, I don't know why \nyou made this video trashing a movie. I'm assuming you're not a Christian, \nand when I saw the title, I didn't watch it, I wanted to see the comments. \nIt made me think: I'm not a Muslim or something, but since I don't know \nwhat the religion does and how it works, I don't go into a mosque and walk \nup and say \"Reasons why your religion sucks.\" First of all, who would \nlisten to me, because it's just an opinion I'm yelling out, and not a \nproblem? And secondly, I don't know what they do so there's no reason for \nme to trash it because I wouldn't understand what I'm talking about. Again, \nI'm not trying to make anyone angry or start an argument. And also, for \nthose who think God giving us free will is ridiculous: think about it. How \nmany successful, happy relationships (parent to child, husband to wife, \netc.) exist if one of the people controls the other one? You have to build \nthe relationship together. It's the same thing with God: He created us to \nhave a relationship with Him, so why would He make us if He would tell us \nwhat to do all the time? He'd be very capable of doing it all Himself. \nChristianity might be hard to understand from the surface, but it's after \nyou take the first step that you start to understand it.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13bf5sivvurjn02z23myxcrrsn3vn4yp04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr4dGwzoZ2sJaLgg9CY6U4A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MeHgbIfXoc8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADo/Yj3Vw7q5RCo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "shintaro shy", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-19T05:32:31.388Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCr4dGwzoZ2sJaLgg9CY6U4A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9750297, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-11-19T05:32:31.388Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116012165155321177598", "textDisplay": "if god wasn't dead before, they just died of embarrasment when this movie \nwas released\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12md5o5mnbnz3n2f23guduzixq4wj4bl04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwZjwyzxDaYPXHEpBOJHIQA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Loh8ItJ_amY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAko/3A97FoLVXUI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "KingStix", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-15T01:11:24.127Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwZjwyzxDaYPXHEpBOJHIQA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.594468, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-15T01:11:56.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105502915341155353338", "textDisplay": "4:03  4:37 i couldnt stop laughing xD\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13agn4pzsftj1vrf04chzl4pq2oevjppfg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7phj-HW7oQOHy4_JbnOl8Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mvKnLqfUOXg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJE/aCHdDAvk8Ec/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Herb Meehan", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-16T22:18:08.400Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7phj-HW7oQOHy4_JbnOl8Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.65388000000000002, "formal_score": 6, "updatedAt": "2015-03-16T22:18:08.400Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105936831531679645148", "textDisplay": "The acting was TERRIBLE, the \"evil\" atheists are super colorful, and it was \nbasically a dopey Christian film.

Ex: atheist husband \nbeing rude to his Christian wife (as we're all his fellow atheists) and his \nstudent(s), and the dad and his daughter where he threw her out of the \nhouse? That was actually pretty accurate. The jerk of a boss/ boyfriend? \nMANY higher up corporate people are jerks to start but they begin to get \nbig headed and figure \"I've gotten this far without God, so what can he \npossibly do for me now?\" They get mean. Many atheists or nontheists will \ntry to sway the belief of a theist and the most common target is \nChristianity. But I don't have much room to judge, it's not my place it's \nHis. They will have to answer to Him one day and if he believes they have \ndone too much bad to counter with good, then they will be damned to hell \nfor the rest of eternity. Any one heard of that book (now movie) Heaven is \nfor Real? My great grandfather had a similar experience and met someone who \nhad the misfortune of meeting satan instead of Christ.

In my opinion, you do make a \npoint with the people born before Christ, but he died for their sins as \nwell, to argue over this would be arguing over a non-physical concept that \nwe barely understand (and perhaps never will).\n\n   With evolution, I am planning to major in Biology and Physics myself, \nbut I'll keep it to the basics. I agree, the fossils are there, but I \nsubmit something to you. We know those creatures existed, but they don't \nhave DNA traces for most of them. So, how can they prove that these \ncreatures split into two orders. For reference, I don't believe the world \nis 6000 years old, far from it. Take that dinosaur with feathers. There is \nnothing saying a lizard can't adapt feathers, and there is no DNA, so all \nthey can truly do is speculate that it evolved into a bird. They have to \nput just as much faith into that half the time as we do in God. \n\n       Imagine if, from birth, you spoiled a child with all the greatest of \nthings. What would they learn? Nothing. In a way, the Devil would've won, \nas being alive would've had no point. What we see as suffering may be God's \nway of testing our faith, for us to show that we truly believe in him. \nSure, like any parent, he knows you love him, even when you say you hate \nhim and break his rules, he still loves you, but every parent wants to hear \nit said right?\n\n   Abortion is a choice, I will not argue with that. But it can be argued \nthe God doesn't cause pregnancy, the processes he built us with cause it. \nHe's just the one to give it a soul and bring it to life. So, that would be \nwhy you can become pregnant and still have it taken away. He knows they may \nnot be ready to parent, but do they? And it may not be the parent it \neffects. it may be their sibling, friend, relative, or perhaps someone they \nhaven't met and never will. As much as people hate to hear it, especially \nin tough times, everything happens for a reason. \n\n   Now, as for The Kingsmen: Secret Service, I've watched it twice. The \nWestboro Baptist Church isn't a Christian church, it's a borderline cult. \nIt is full of blasphemy and non-biblical doctrine. So, I honestly have no \nproblem with how the film portrays them, it's pretty close to the reality.

But you get my drift. \n\nYou do make a solid point about square one though, we have ,made a lot of \nprogress, and giving advanced technology to primitive civilisations would \nprobably be catastrophic. \n\nTrue, we do combat viruses pretty well, but why is it a trial of life? It \ndoesn't exactly teach us a lesson besides two things: A) life will shit on \nyou sometimes B) some living things are pure assholes. \n\nBut other then that, it's just suffering.\n\nWith miscarriages, they may affect the world in some unforeseen way, but as \nfor the \"the person may not of been ready for parenthood\" That would make \nsense, but that is like 70% of the reason why abortion exists, Now ont he \nabortion argument, My stance is simply, If there is a justifiable reaosn \nbehind why, then it can be done. Reasons like: The person was raped, The \nperson might die in the childbirth, The person is not ready for parenthood \n(which is why the miscarriage argument doesn't make sense, wouldn't god see \nthese people aren't ready?) The person doesn't have the money to support a \nbaby and the living arrangments/are would probably kill the baby anyway. \nETC. \n\nShouldn't God literally just make all of these miscarriages so that doctors \ndon't have to do it?\n\nAlso, found a hollywood movie that shows Christians!! \n\nKingsmen: However, I'm not sure to what extent this represents Christians \nas it's emulating the westboro baptist church. Though I do feel the \nmassacre that proceeded within was a little dark for the generally \nsatirical and light movie... ... ... But anyway, if you've seen it, I'd \nlove to hear your thoughts on it.

The account I transcribed is an \ninterpretation put together from several scriptures (such as in Revelation \nwhere it describes the Devil as \"A dragon whose tail swept a third of the \nstars out of Heaven\"). They teach it in multiple churches, it isn't solely \nmine. \n    Secondly, I'm glad you got that Joke, but back to the point. \n    The point is that life has a choice. We aren't made into robots that \nfollow life by every order, we can choose against God's wishes. You could \nsay God wanted life to mean something, but as to why we needed to live in \nthe first place, the answer is one we probably will never know, and \nwouldn't understand if we did. \n    I choose to believe in evolution to an extent. I don't believe all \nlifeforms share a common ancestor or that men and chimps do, but I do \nbelieve creatures evolve based on Order (i.e. frogs can become new frogs, \nbats new bats, all the marsupials are related). Just search Order as a \nbiological term and you'll see. Even if they get traits that appear to \nmimic other Order's, they'd still come from their own (\"and every animal \nthat creepeth upon the earth after it's KIND).\n    As for why the Universe is soooo big, I say that's proof that we are \nnot alone. I say that maybe on some distant, Earth-like world are more \nhumans (They'ed just look different based on slight genetic changes do to \nreproduction, think Star Trek). \n   Even with renewable energy and space travel, we're human, we'd still \nkill each other, just for different reasons. Plus, was this all that bad \nstarting from square one, I think we've made good progress, don't you. We \ncurrently live in the most peaceful era in history (seriously, Google it). \n     Disease is just another part of life, another trial to endure, and \nit's not like he left us helpless, we combat them rather well. \n     And finally, miscarriages. That baby is guiltless, so it's back up to \nheaven. Even with an incredibly short life, it fulfilled a purpose. Perhaps \nthat person wasn't ready for parenthood, and this taught them that, or \nmaybe it affected the world in some other way. I look forward to your \nresponse and further questions, as always.

God \nbless your hearts and I will pray for you to choose the right path in your \nlife. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zsf2bjpuwyfkrh04cel0jns2ze1wjdjs": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOTVB15LGiItdhtFTYn9TmA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-H4teOTvZjec/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWo/Yi-QilS7Zt0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "DodgaOfficial", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-16T21:29:49.813Z", "videoId": "7dAs1iMycW0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOTVB15LGiItdhtFTYn9TmA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.457818, "formal_score": 12, "updatedAt": "2015-10-16T21:29:49.813Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116947500027252737047", "textDisplay": "A lot of Christians literally could care less about the quality of the \nmovies they watch.

You claim that it is not, but I can assure you, \nit is. You didn't say what religion you were, but I can clearly see from \nthis video and the way you talk about this movie that you are not a \nChristian. Honestly, that is your choice. I can't force my beliefs upon \nyou. But let me tell you why this video is not a reliable review and why \nyou are utterly and COMPLETELY wrong about this whole thing. First off, the \nfact that you are completely against Christianity and the idea of God \nexisting at all makes you exactly like the professor from this movie. I \ndon't mean this as an insult, but let me tell you this makes your review \nunreliable. Of course you are going to hate this movie. You think \nChristianity is a load of crap with no truth in the \"theory\" at all. For \nexample, if I personally saw a movie that supported atheism, honestly, I \nwould look for everything wrong with the movie (exactly what you did for \nGod's Not Dead\") and encourage anybody who asked NOT to watch it, because \nit goes against my Christian faith what I believe in. Of course you are \nnaturally biased towards something that you support or believe in. It's \nhard not to be. Second of all, the goal of the director or anybody involved \nin making this movie was not to make a multi- Academy Award winning movie. \nThe goal was to get the message out there to people who haven't had the \nchance to hear it, or who haven't heard it enough in their lives. The goal \nwasn't to make billions of dollars and make the actors huge Hollywood \ncelebrities. The goal was to tell the amazing news that this is a God out \nthere, a loving God, who wants us to spend eternity with him in heaven. You \nmay turn my statement around and say \"now YOU'RE the one being religiously \nbiased\", and to be honest, a little bit I am. But I can honestly say that \nthere have been plenty of Christian movies that I have seen and thought \nwere poorly written or had bad acting. This, my friend, was not one of \nthem. The surprise ending was very suspenseful and well thought out. I \nthought the movie was very well done, and I would encourage anyone who is \nstruggling with their faith to see it. In conclusion, I can honestly say \nwithout a doubt, that there IS a living God who loves us!

But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My \nFather who is in heaven. Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. \nI did not come to bring peace but a sword...\"* (Matthew 10:32-34).\n\nThat last verse tells us that as long as we sincerely desire to follow \nChrist with our lives, we will experience conflict from others who are in \nthe world (such as depicted by the Professor in this movie), who oppose \nChrist. To do something we know is wrong, with the idea that we can just \nget forgiven later is presuming on God's grace. The apostle Paul was later \ndivinely inspired of God to write, \"What shall we say then? Shall we \ncontinue in sin that grace may abound? Certainly not! How shall we who died \nto sin live any longer in it?\" (Romans 6:1-2).\n\n\nSince you seem more concerned about other religions \"look[ing] bad\" than \nI'd be curious to learn how you (as a Christian believer) understand \nScripture verses like where Jesus taught His exclusive \"one way\" \nrevelation; such as, \"if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in \nyour sins.\" (John 8:24); and \"\u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life.

And how many people posting here have said stuff along the lines \nof, \"Hey thanks, man. You saved me from wasting two hours of my life \nwatching this movie, it sounds really sh--ty...\" and rated the review with \na thumbs up? (Be honest, do you really believe they don't?) Because when \nyou rate this review positive, that's basically the same thing as rating \nthe actual movie thumbs down, based on someone else's opinion, *without* \nwatching it. So go try and bulldoze someone else with such a flimsy \nrationale.\n\nNot that I'm protesting anyone's right to spend their time on what they \nwant. Granted, I regularly review current movies and DVD releases out at \nPluggedIn.com, so that I don't waste my time and money on movies containing \ncrass, mindless violence, 300 f-bombs, New Age religious indoctrination, \ngratuitous illicit sex and bloody gore, etc. But please let's be honest \nabout the real reasoning behind it. Their main objection is not all this \nsuperfluous stuff about \"production values\"; but rather that the movie \npresents and is based on a worldview that cramps their style and challenges \ntheir rationale to live their lives *just the way* they want to. Whether \nthat's boinking their SO (usually), getting drunk (or high) while \npartying-heartily on the weekends, cheating on exams, holding a grudge of \nunforgiveness against an absentee or otherwise dysfunctional parent, pride, \ngreed, or *________* (fill-in-the-blank), they'd rather just not consider \nthe evidence for a Supreme Being in the place of a \"first cause\" the way \nthe Bible presents Him as being.\n\n>\"religious bias...pristine vernacular...\"\n\nAs I could say \"anti-religious bias\" and \"crude irreverence\". By your own \n(subjective) standards, it's six of one and a half-dozen of the other. The \nonly difference seems to be that I accept what the Bible has to say about \n\"coarse jesting\" (Ephesians 5), while you deny the evidence of Scripture \nand make excuses for filthy talk. All I know is, we'll find out in the end \nwhich worldview is correct.

If your kids disobeyed, \nwould you set them on fire?\"\n\nMaybe the real underlying question (implied in your statement) is, \"Am I \nGod's *child*?\" \n\nTo illustrate with an analogy, if your preschool-aged child is outside \nthrowing rocks (despite your as a parent having warned him several times \nnot to) and breaks a neighbor's window, do you set him on fire, as \npunishment? Of course not. You'd likely scold him (or her), maybe give him \nsome \"time out\" in a corner for a while. But your first reaction is going \nto be making sure they didn't accidentally cut themselves on the flying \nglass. If they're significantly injured, you take them to the doctor/clinic \nand have them treated, like any loving parent would do for a child (even \none who is disobedient). \n\nBut who pays for the replacement for the broken window; and any medical \nbills? *You* do. That's sort of like what happened when God paid the price \nof our ultimate disobedience through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus \nChrist. He wasn't the One responsible for the wrongs we committed. But as a \nloving Father, He does not simply leave us to deal with the consequences.\nOf course there are temporal penalties to pay for sin and disobedience, \neven for children, that may vary given their age and maturity level. \nSuppose for a moment the rock-thrower in our hypothetical scenario is a \nteenager. They might be grounded for a few days, a week, or even a month \n(if they are a repeat offender). Maybe the parent in this case only pays \nfor half the cost of the window; and the teen has to make up the other half \nthrough earnings from their part-time weekend job.\nSame offense, right? Yet the penalty is different for a 15-yr-old than it \nwould be for a five-year-old. Why? They're older. Their thinking skills \nhave had time to mature. They should've known better. Likewise, God often \ndisciplines those whom He loves differently, depending on the length of \ntime they've been following Him, whether our sin in a particular area is \nbecoming habitual, etc. In each case, however, the discipline is motivated \nby His love and to try and keep us from greater harm down the road.\nLet's consider a similar scenario where the rock-thrower is a derelict \nadult stranger who is trying to gain access to a home in order to rob it. \nHe is caught, arrested, jailed and taken to court. During this process, it \nis discovered that he has a rap sheet for previous offenses. The judge \npronounces sentence; so he maybe does jail time in addition to paying costs \nof court, restitution (for the broken window), etc.\n\nI realize the analogy is far from perfect. But the point is, the parents \n(God) in this case have no vested interest in advocating for the \nindividual. He's of no relationship to them. He is given the full penalty \nthe Law (i.e. the O.T. law of \"sin and death\") allows.\n\nBut getting back to your original question (the differentiating factor of \nsonship or \"daughter-ship\"), you may be familiar with the saying that \"God \nhas no grandchildren\". He only recognizes one method of entering into His \n\"family\" upon the age of accountability; and that is by adoption. (Romans \n8:14-16; Gal. 4:4-6; Eph. 1:4-6). We aren't automatically \"born\" believing. \nThat's why there are dedication ceremonies in many Protestant churches for \nthe parents and their infants/young children, where they promise to \"train \nup [their] child[ren] in the way that they should go.\" (Proverbs 22:6).\nA more concise way of illustrating your original question might be more \nrelevantly phrased as would we discard a plate or a cup that was \nirreparably broken and no longer able to serve in its original intended \nfunction. Because we are the creation of God, not the *child* of God (i.e., \nin relationship to Him), until we have willingly and voluntarily accepted \nHim as our Father. It might be some of the most expensive, rare china; but \nif it's in pieces, what's the point of keeping it? \nOf course if one believes in evolution then they do not comprehend \n\"creation\" in its original sense and framework, with God being preeminent \nand with the right to adopt His own rules for governing His creation and so \non."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf4nj1kRdyTi6vtXF_4ni5Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "pbot27", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125s3pbjtumyrxqg04cdn5hlxqlibf44v00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-28T16:51:25.340Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCf4nj1kRdyTi6vtXF_4ni5Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.88840569999999996, "formal_score": 4, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-05-28T16:51:25.340Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101530734051782783813", "textDisplay": "+ThatClassic70sGirl And what happened to you?

Those statements comprise your hypothesis; and are pretty \nfar-reaching. You can't just state conclusions like that without evidence \nto back them up.\nThe lack of proof is not equivalent to a lack of evidence. There *is* \nevidence, just not *conclusive* evidence, as you seem to want; because yes, \nfaith is ultimately required; and God doesn't want people to follow Him \nagainst their will just because of intellectual arguments or whatever. Most \natheists and agnostics just refuse to acknowledge and consider the evidence \nthat *does* exist, because they know that were they to accept Jesus, their \nmoral values, priorities and lifestyle would have to change; and they don't \nwant that. Deep down they fear that they are not able to change; and/or \nthey would no longer be \"happy\" if they weren't able to continue living \ntheir lives the way they are now.

So you're agreeing with the movie that \napparently all atheist are cruel, devil-believing bastards? Apparently you \nmissed out on the memo that atheists don't believe in any higher-power, let \nalone a God. And we don't need religion to have good morales either. Warren \nBuffet, an atheist, donated around $41 BILLION dollars to \"health, \neducation, humanitarian causes\". Bill and Melinda Gates, very famous and \nalso very atheist, donated $27.6 BILLION dollars to  \"global health and \ndevelopment, education\". One of USA's leading philanthropists was an \natheist by the name of Andrew Carnegie. Are you telling me that because \nthey donated millions of dollars to lost causes, that they are bad people? \nI'm not here to bash religious people, I'm here to defend those who are not \nreligious. You can't claim that an atheist professor would flunk Christians \nin real life because, well, they don't.  By the way, the professor is an \nANTI-THEIST, not an atheist. And don't tell me I didn't consider the facts. \nI'm all about the facts, unlike you. I understand that you have a mission \nto \"save people's souls\" and whatnot, but you don't understand that us \natheists don't believe in that mission, or any other mission for that \nmatter. When I die, I'm going to rot in the dirt and I'll become the \nnutrients needed for plants, which will be eaten by animals. That's what I \nbelieve in. I don't care for selfish desires like living on in the \"next \nlife\" because I'm content in the one I am living, but you're telling me \nthat I'M the one who doesn't know. *I lived and breathed in church*, \nfollowing a \"God\" I knew didn't exist. I chose to stop believing in that \nmyth. I find it ridiculous that humans really think of themselves as so \nimportant, they made a god who resembles them physically and claimed that \nthat very god would give them eternal happiness, when in reality, god is \njust a figment of their imaginations to explain all the evil in the world.  \nIf a horse were capable of believing in a god, their god would look like a \nhorse. Same thing with a dog. A dog's god would look like a dog. Anyway, \natheists aren't evil-doers. If anything, you christians are. You all \ncontinue to believe in the \"preachings\" of a god that doesn't exist, even \nif that very god preaches awful things. Ie : Leviticus 20:13 \" If a man \nlies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an \nabomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. \" \nYou're saying that killing homosexuals is right? That deeming them as evil \nfor loving is okay? Leviticus 19:28 \"'Do not cut your bodies for the dead \nor put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD. \" So, I'm not allowed to \nmourn my mother, because of some book? I'm not allowed to show I remember \nher? 1 Timothy 2:12 \"I permit no woman to teach or have authority over man. \nshe is to remain silent.\" Okay. So, what are your views on female teachers? \nAre you going to kill them too? Discriminate them? This passage basically \nforces women into being submissive. I think you should study your fictional \nbook more, saying I don't know anything. 1 Peter 2:18 \" You who are slaves \nmust accept the authority of your masters with all respect. Do what they \ntell you--not only if they are kind and reasonable, but even if they are \ncruel. For it is your credit if, being aware of God, you endure pain while \nsuffering unjustly.\" Oh look! A passage supporting slaves. A passage that \nclaims that slavery is acceptable. *DO NOT TRY TO TELL ME THAT THIS WAS \nWRITTEN IN THE CONTEXT OF HISTORY. IF YOU STILL BELIEVE IN THIS FAITH, YOU \nBELIEVE IN ALL FORMS OF IT, EVEN THE EVILNESS IT PREACHES*"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOI95XsFGHpIrIwwJTrmB-g", "inappropriate_score": 1.10803324099723, "authorDisplayName": "disturbedrocks1996", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13yfffyfum2xhy3b22ncpibtnqcgdhw204", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-28T18:46:20.231Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOI95XsFGHpIrIwwJTrmB-g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.7783199999999999, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-28T18:46:20.231Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MKw-ue664XQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/rbRQZwcUDyo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116512826589820796404", "textDisplay": "+Mike Corleone Dude, if an atheist would flunk his student for no other \nreason than he's a Christian he's a piece of fucking garbage.
