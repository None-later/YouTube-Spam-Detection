A perfect example in \na corporate environment is when management shuffles roles around to make \ntheir escalation procedures more efficient.\n\nSecond comes down to negotiating power. When a company hires a new employee \nthey always offer them the least amount of money they're willing to pay, \nbut they always set up a max range that they'd accept should the new \nemployee demand a higher salary than originally listed. If an employee has \nthe temerity to demand the a higher salary, gueas what, they could probably \nearn more thsn their boss who chose to accept the minimum original salary \nthe company offer.\n\n3rd is simply time at work. If an employee's been working for a company \nlonger, has asked for & recieved raises it's possible that a new boss might \nactually be offered a lower salary anyway.\n\n4th, in some countries in certain roles a company has a legal obligation to \npay a new employee MORE than they were recieving in their last job. So if \nine company desperately needs a role filled and the options available to \nthem are from people who were earning higher salaries than they pay their \nmore senior staff now, they have no option but to pay their new/subordinate \na higher salary. They are under no obligation to then offer the more senior \nemployee more money.\n\nImmediately throwing your hands up and claim \"SEXISM\" is ridiculous.\nCould it be sexism...sure. Very possible.

In between lets say the woman has a few kids plus days off \nfor kids she takes off like 3 years. The father might only take a few \nmonths off max for kids. Now the women will always have 3 years of less \nexperience than the man. So if i company decides to pay based on experience \nthen she will get same pay as the man AFTER 3 years. She will always be 3 \nyears behind in experience. After 15 years the man would've worked 15 years \nand the women would have worked 12.  So even if she does not have any more \nkids in the future she still has less experience. She is less likely to be \npromoted because of her lack of experience. So the man earns even more. \nThis isnt about discrimination. Its about who shows up at work. This is not \nto say women are lazy because taking care of kids is important.\n\nAt the same time you cant take time off and then try to get the same as the \nman who has been working all these years and now has built up way more \nexperience than you have. The world does not work like that.\n\n If you want the women with less experience to get paid more then you \naren't really for equal pay. You are for more pay for less work and \nexperience. If you have the same experience and you put in the same time as \na man. Then and only then you should get paid the same. There are no \nhandouts in life.\n\n I promise you if businesses could hire women to get the same work as a man \nwhile paying her less no one would hire men."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-XOz74YuBR4eZVwoIbgaag", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ilovegrunge123", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13sy1gpxwnndzjem22jell5lvjkz3qbv04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-17T21:58:41.394Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-XOz74YuBR4eZVwoIbgaag"}, "sentiment_score": -0.26726399999999995, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-05-17T21:58:41.394Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gGYWG0HUbiQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAhg/CwaXNFDPeIQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103128331454174798962", "textDisplay": "There are many women who work who are past menopause and women who already \nhad children and don't want more.

Your reading comprehension skills are not too far \noff from that of a third grader, you simpleton. My point was that if women \nwant a particular perk men have, in this case higher pay, then men should \nhave the same perks that women have, such as the right to maternity (or in \ntheir case, paternity) leave, the lack of any social expectation for them \nto work, \n\nGenders are inherently different. If I'm an employer, I will pay the person \ndoing a better job more money. There are many ways in which woman cannot \ndoing a better job than men. The most obvious way is their strength: If \nwomen and men are working in a factory or something, and men are able to \nlift twice as much as the women, that means their labor is twice as \nefficient. In that scenario, they *should* be paid more. \n\n\"Are you saying men shouldn't have a right to bond with their newborn child \nthe same as a woman ? \"\n\nI clearly voiced support for men who want paternity leave. Paternity leave \nis far from a universal male worker's right. I'm pointing out how the \n\"unequal\" wages tend to \"balance out\" by the fact that men rarely are able \nto have paternity leave.

Second, while women \nstill face many problems with regard to sexism in society: the statements \nmade by The Young Turks are absolutely sexist towards men!  When naive \npeople make these types of arguments about sexism they do so in a perpetual \nvacuum!  Erudite analysis of this issue must be based on the real world \nenvironment: not just some nonsense analysis of an anecdotal statistic like \nwages.  Although, they did mention the fact that wages are dependent on \nmany different variables that have nothing to do with sex, but your cult \nlike mantra of \"women are always victims of men in society\" is not a \nlogically verifiable conclusion! \n\nHow about mentioning the fact that women do not work in coal mines, or \nwomen were never drafted by the government to fight in wars?  Obviously \nmentioning how sexism in society oppresses men is not in whatever leftist \ncult your organization subscribes too!  So, if you want to have a debate \nabout sexism, and want to not sound like a leftist cult member you might \nwant to mention the fact that men also suffer from sexism...  Obviously the \nbest way to make people equal in the work place is to have a 50/50 gender \nratio, and making pay standardized for each position in the organization.  \nBut, this is not practical since then women would have to do jobs that they \nare physically not able to do.  A good example is sports which by \ndefinition is a sexist organization; furthermore, men would also have to do \nthings that many men find unappealing like stripping...  So, with this \nunderstanding and analysis I hope you can see how you are making sexist \narguments towards men!  Your argument is that women should be \"equal\" in \nthe way that they get to have jobs in some sort of upper class of paper \npushers who manage men slaving in coal mines!\n\nAlso the argument that \"Women are perceived as emotion\"  is not singular to \nwomen, and men also have perceptions that inhibit them!  Like \"Men are just \nsexual obsessed, and they are all sexist\" which I'm sure Ana Kasparian \nloves to dish out at any chance she can get.  Obviously, the analysis that \npeople suffer from sexist stereotypes is not monopolized by women...  So, \nto repeat the same old fake feminist mantra is not enlightening nor does it \nhelp oppressed women!  It only serves to divide people more by making more \nwomen hate men, and therefore making men hate more women.  People suffer \nfrom all types of stereotypes.  Obviously people who are better looking do \nbetter in the news industry, but does Ana Kasparian fight for more not \nsexually appealing people in the new industry?  No, obviously she uses her \nsexuality to the maximum! Which if Ana Kasparian actually spent time \nreading feminist doctrine she would realize this is not what real feminists \nare advocating.  Feminist don't think that dressing overtly as a sexual \nobject is helping oppressed women!  It actually is perpetuating the \npatriarchy!  So, no intellectual is going to take you seriously Ana \nKasparian, because you are literally an oxymoron who is perpetuating \npatriarchy and sexual objectification!\n\nFinally, I hope that you now understand that equality in the workplace is \nnot achieved by repeated cult mantras over and over again, and being a huge \noxymoron!  It is achieved by striving to perfection while never truly \nobtaining the 100% we all seek logically.  And, people must never let their \nculture interfere with real world data and analysis that can lead to a less \noppressive world!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zfnkwaoyujjh3s23nhhfhctiogjoki": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChVMjQet8dDHQK2DOXRFCvA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RQTqkeLAB20/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABQ/LsjJbGZ8wA4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mary Allen", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-17T22:07:44.020Z", "videoId": "0cGdDWYlyZ8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UChVMjQet8dDHQK2DOXRFCvA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99995604589999998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-05-17T22:07:44.020Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118119940848228343187", "textDisplay": "ANA!!!

Emotion can lead someone \nto study something rationally. It's all a matter of perception.\n I am angered when someone tells me I have nothing of value to offer due to \nmy lack of faith, but that does not make me irrational. Anger is an \nemotion. Emotions can be controlled to some extent. A rational mind does \nnot allow their emotions to run them. It really has more to do with context \nand perception.\nThe psychology behind emotional intelligence. That is something worth \ndelving into for shits n giggles.

We're talking about equal pay for equal work. \nIt's that simple.\"\n\nNo Ana, it's not that simple, because there are a lot of factors that are \nin play when it comes to salaries. I'm a Software Engineering major. Lets \nsay a woman gets the same degree as I did and we both get hired for the \nsame job. Equal pay for equal work? No, because I or the woman may done \nmore than just passed the required classes. I may have also had a few \ninternships at big companies under my belt, where the woman doesn't. I may \nalso speak a critical, second language like Japanese where she may only \nknow Spanish as a second language. I may also know other areas that could \nbe a part for a different position. See how I could make more than my \ncounterpart? People seem to forget that whatever job you go for, you have \nto sell yourself. Just because you meet the bare minimums doesn't mean you \nshould get the same pay as the person you just replaced. The person you \nplaced may have worked there 10+ plus years. How can you expect to get paid \nwhere that person left off? And in the case of older job seekers, you \nhistory is a big factor for negotiation that's going to get weighed in.\n\nAlso in regards to equal pay, it's complete bullshit, but feminists like \nAna and this old lady don't want acknowledge it, even though they know it. \nHere is the example of how equal pay is bullshit:\n\nA boy and a girl with no work experience graduates high school with \nmatching 3.0 GPAs. They both get their first jobs at a company on the same \nday to perform the same work. 5 years go by and they both got raises on the \nsame day, so their pay is equal. Both gets married to two different people \nand starts their own families at the same time. The male continues to work \nas usual expecting a child to be born, but the female has to take maternity \nleave, meaning the company has to make up for the lack of her work. She \nreturns of maternity leave after missing a few months worth of work. 2 \nyears down the line, both decides to have another child, and another and \nanother. By the 15th year, the male is making $5K more than the female, but \nthe female is claiming discrimination, due to \"unequal pay for equal work.\"\n\nWhat's the problem with that example? The woman didn't take into account \nthat SHE decided to have children and the fact that a business is in the \nbusiness of making MONEY. Since she decided to have children, the company \nhas to spend money to pay others overtime to make up for her slack or in \nsome cases, temporarily hire someone. For the whole 15 years, the male has \ncontinuously been a productive asset to the company and the company may \nhave wanted to retain him. And that's just one factor. \n\nBluntly, these are the reasons for \"unequal pay for equal work:\"\n1. Women that want to start families while working.\n2. Women that left the workforce to be housewives/home-bodies, then later \non, rejoining the workforce.\n3. Statistics doesn't differentiate between married moms, single moms and \nwomen with no kids.\n4. Statistics doesn't differentiate between full-time and part-time. I can \ntell you this. Working security at a nuclear power plant pays 3-5 times \nmore an hour than security at your local mall.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12isbwp5mnnwpuw204ci52j0vbudpszshs": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5-TjsXsQsCtU9IB1CWrGmA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-d5kPeiqbfxY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACgU/dWaPfL1zLCk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Paul Brown", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-17T03:21:42.256Z", "videoId": "0cGdDWYlyZ8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5-TjsXsQsCtU9IB1CWrGmA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.96623779999999992, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-05-17T03:21:42.256Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112279861496508776500", "textDisplay": "Doesn't the Fox-Girl realize that she's a big part of the reason Fox has \nthe ratings it does?

Kiev was swiftly \ntaken by a mob of armed insurgents and chased the now-former ELECTED \npresident out of Ukraine fearing for his life.\n\nThey tacitly play along with the warmongers' narrative that anybody who \ndares voice their displeasure with Nuland's coup government -- which \nforcibly displaced the leader that Eastern Ukrainians and Crimeans voted \nfor by a large margin -- are \"terrorists\".  CNN language.\n\nThat alone tells me all i need to know.  I have a friend (old exchange \nstudent from high school) who has made it plain how united the Eastern \nregions are against the blatantly illegitimate government that the US is \nworking hard to force-feed to these people against their will.  Even \nwithout his account of events, it is plain to see these people are not \nafraid of Putin.\n\nIf anything, they want security assurances from Russia... which Putin \ncannot give at the moment or else he'd be playing into the hands of the \ngovernment that set all of these events into motion.\n\nBut how would you feel if Washington was mobbed by a foreign-backed \ninsurgency that China or Russia had invested billions into destabilizing \nthe US?  Would you consider yourself a terrorist for not wanting to bend \nover and take orders from a coup government, a band of puppets that get \ntheir directives from outside the nation they are governing \"in the name of \ndemocracy\"??\n\nI suspect you would not.  Nor would most people, including myself.  People \nwould come together and resist just as they are in the areas of Ukraine on \nhigh-alert for invasion from the new coup government.\n\n*In any case, OUR government, Obama's Administration, is meddling yet again \nin the internal affairs of a faraway country.  But this time, their target \nis a nuclear power with a large army.  Kind of a bigger deal than 4939393th \ncherry-picked story about how corporations are just so much more interested \nin conciously excluding women from their businesses, or paying them \"less \nthen they are worth\"  than they are in maximizing their profits. It's all \nabout \"patriarchy\", not utilizing human resources in a manner that is most \nconducive to higher revenues. Yup, sure... more important to harp on that \n(again, and again) than do some reporting about a potential WW3 scenario on \nthe horizon.*\n\nI've been subscribed to TYT since 2006 when every foreign policy miscue was \nput under a microscope and a year later this new \"Hope & Change\" figure \ncomes out of nowhere promising to put an end to the war-profiteering and \nwrongheaded foreign policy that had/has been creating more enemies and \npushing allies away.\n\nEnter PRESIDENT (not Candidate) Obama.  He focuses all his anti-war \nsentiment on Iraq, the easy one since it was such an open blunder for the \nworld to see.  *But for all the rhetoric, Obama doesn't really do all that \nmuch to change anything on the ground in Iraq until it's time to start \ncampaigning for re-election 3.5 years later... when it is politically \nexpedient and people were calling him out on it.*\n\nErstwhile, he *tripled the number of troops in Afghanistan during the \nspectacularly futile and counter-productive \"Surge\".  He went over \nCongress' head to literally turn Libya into a failed state -- when it had \nbeen the Beverly Hills of Africa beforehand -- as he bombed Libya to rubble \nand helped arm Sunni radicals who are now fighting the next war for him in \nSyria.\n\nGaddafi was murdered out of hand, without even a trial. Libya is now in \nchaos, worse off than before the US/NATO got rid of \"the bad guy who wanted \nout of the petrodollar\".  Humanitarian motives were not even on the radar \nfor that one.\n\nIf you really believe TYT scrutinizes Obama's foreign policy moves to the \nsame extent that they did for Bush, you are delusional.  The anti-war folks \non the left went silent once it was Obama doing the bombing and countless \ndrone strikes... it's more or less common knowledge. *They even stay \nrelatively mum on the outrageously unconstitutional NDAA... a little fuss \nand then onto the next TMZ-style topic.*\n\nAnd no i am not a GOP guy.  I just see the mainstream media -- and \nincreasingly (sadly) partisan-driven TYT -- let the \"Team Blue vs. Team \nRed\" game affect the objectivity of their reporting.

Is capitalism all about profit \nover people or is it gender discrimination? Because you cannot have both.\n\nIf the average woman performs in a way in which she brings equal value to \nthe workplace as the average man of a given occupation, yet only receives \n75% of the pay, a profit driven capitalist pig would have every incentive \nto hire only women at 75% of the cost! However, in reality we observe that \nboth men and women are of roughly equal demand on the market place for \nlabor. This either means that profit is not an incentive for companies and \nthat irrational discrimination is so massively widespread that companies \nwillingly sustain a loss in productivity of 25% just so that they can \ndiscriminate against women; or feminists are wrong.\n\nOf course the right answer is the latter. Women are paid less for \ncompletely rational reasons which reflects their capacity to satisfy market \ndemand. Women are, for instance, about 4 years younger than their men and \nthus not as far advanced in their careers, meaning that a woman is more \neconomical to withdraw from the labor market for the average household \neconomy. Women also tend to want to give birth to children, which means \nthey get pregnant and breastfeed. Meanwhile, men work to support the family \nand improve the value of their labor.\n\nWe observe that single women who never had kids indeed earn approximately \nthe same as men of the same category. This supports the notion that \ncompanies are too motivated by profit to exercise irrational prejudice. \nEqual pay laws would enforce disequilibrium and increasingly render women \nunemployable.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12bglc42xyptjgpr04cgruoryjqfjdzbko0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZpmQNBagNDkLZLdeEQAlWQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "occhamite", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-30T14:38:25.198Z", "videoId": "0cGdDWYlyZ8", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZpmQNBagNDkLZLdeEQAlWQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.49923999999999996, "formal_score": 5, "updatedAt": "2014-12-30T14:38:25.198Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103741535606263937741", "textDisplay": "\"No one wants a woman to automatically get paid something...\"\n\nKasparian must live on some other planet.

I was reading but saw nothing truly convincing in what you said until \nthe very end. That point was devastating. I mean the one about being able \nto hire a woman to do the exact same work for less pay than a man should \nlead to the incentive to hire women over men. Following the rules of supply \nand demand, eventually that would drive down the salary for men, too. So, \nhow is it possible that this gap exists? Market forces should equalize the \npay if the the jobs really are exactly the same, not just in title.\n\nI'd like to hear the counter-argument as to why a pay-gap could be real \ngiven the existence of market forces on salaries.\n\nI agree that men often get promoted over women, and that that is a real \nwork-place issue to addressed. As others have said here, it has less to do \nwith a woman's job skills, and more to do with her lesser workplace \ncommitment. It's understandable that she may want to start a family and \nwill have no choice but to take maternity leave in that case. So, I think \none way to get better work-place equality would be to have mandatory \npaternity leave. To be practical, I'd recommend mandating that any new \nfathers be required to take paternity leave starting at the completion of \ntheir wives' (or partner's) maternity leave. Of course, I doubt men would \nbe willing to fight for a law like mandatory paternity leave because I'd \nguess on average that men like to focus more on career than family.
