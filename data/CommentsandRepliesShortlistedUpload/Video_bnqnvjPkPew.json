If you \nare not a hip hop kid and are black you are not with the mainstream culture \nso many of course want acceptance by from their peers. Sure adults can \nsimply look past this but a 13yr old walking the halls of a middle school \nsurrounded by hundreds of other 13 year olds may ultimately feel alienated \nfor being different. Of course the music doesn't pull the trigger but it \ncertainly reinforces the narrative that its okay to do so in order to \nobtain respect or be \"tough\". It also reinforces objectifying women.

My kids don't listen to gangster rap \nbecause it's not age appropriate, an 8 year old should be watching Disney \nChannel and not MTV in the first place.....Everything that has explicit \ncontent, SAYS SO ON THE TIN, everyone out there knows exactly what you get \nwhen you listen to explicit rap, it's been that way since forever. Some of \nthe most explicit rap songs are decades old when the \"PARENTAL ADVISORY\" \nlabel was first introduced. It's the internet that gives them access to it \nall, I know that for a fact because like I said MTV and BET and radio \nstations in general are notorious for their overzealous daytime censorship. \nIf kids go on to look it up on the net and find it that means the parents \nlet them. and if you're a parent and Lil Wayne talking about guns and hoes \nhas more influence on your boy then you're not a good father at all. If \nlike you said kids want to be rich like Lil Wayne and not poor like their \nbroke father, then they would get up and go and record music, not pop \nbottles and twerk\n\n\nYou're saying even with their censorship and warnings of explicit content, \nif it wasn't for MTV and radio showing people shooting and grinding on each \nother and saying the N word, then there would be a difference in ghetto \nculture, and children turning to drugs and guns is that what you mean? \nLIES! Like I said these social problems faced in the ghetto have been going \non long before hip hop even became a word. It\u2019s not that hip-hop causes \nthese problems, but rather hip-hop is a reflection of them. Most of what \nthese rappers sing about is what they grew up with...Many rappers grew up \namid violence, police harassment, poverty, drugs and promiscuity. Rappers \nwill tell you they rap about what they know. If the community wants to \nchange rap lyrics, the community must change reality.\n\n\nI found out that In 2007 the murder rates in New York (the birthplace of \nhip-hop) and Chicago (hometown of Kanye West) decreased to levels unseen \nsince the 1960s. Made even more noteworthy given that firearms are far more \nprevalent and powerful today than years ago. Also a study in 2006 also \nfound that crime rates across all major cities declined in the \"gangsta \nrap\" 1990s to levels more closely resembling those of the big-band era.\n\n\n\nYou mentioned whites and blacks liking the same music but whites going home \nafter and blacks turning to drugs because drugs are a reality to them. \nThat's my whole point! It's not the hip hop that makes them do anything, \nit's the fact that the drugs are already a reality in their lives. The \nwhites don't have that, their daily life realities are not littered with \npoor-performing schools, a lack of extracurricular activities and limited \njob opportunities stemming from postindustrial economic changes? \nPredominantly white communities are not occupied by tacitly accepted \nopen-air drug markets, police brutality, unevenly distributed justice and \nfamilies enduring the legacy of economic oppression and subjugation, clear \nserious social problems yet critics find it easier to lash out at a \n23-year-old rapper wearing bling and a video showing bathing suit-clad \nbeauties than to take on public officials who continually under fund public \neducation. It also is easier to chastise a rapper for his depiction of \nviolence than to challenge the National Rifle Association and support bans \non assault rifles or handguns. If the country wants to change rap lyrics, \nthe country must change the realities that inspire those lyrics."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w", "inappropriate_score": 0.15455950540958269, "authorDisplayName": "hud1231", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12jylgiiybxjfawm04cjbuponuovbpwuhs", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-05T23:11:10.366Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.45155400000000001, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-05T23:11:10.366Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MFc7nsWzovY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/7syS2LpnF3Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104225673499407483728", "textDisplay": "Nah, if it wasn't for the radio and mtv pushing it on kids they wouldn't \nlook it up.

Music does affect \nyour mood but it does not cause you to act inappropriately. Your character \nis what motivates your behavior in life. When you are growing up your \nmorals define you as a person and influences around you in your personal \nlife. \n- kids in the burb listen to and watch music and film that glorify \nviolence, sex and drugs just as much if not more than kids in the ghetto. \nKids in the burb watch porn and all kinds of explicit content more than \nkids in the ghetto, but kids in the burb go on to become doctors, lawyers \nand presidents more than kids in the ghetto. Hip hop is not the cause for \nproblems in the ghetto, in fact it's other problems with in the ghetto that \nlead kids to speaking the hip hop way, getting rid of hip hop won't get rid \nof the real problems.\n- Lil Wayne's content is very much influenced by the ghetto and where he \ngrew up and not the other way round. If anything everything you see in all \nthe videos originated from the ghetto. The drugs, the shootings everything, \nwas already there in the ghetto before Ludacris and Co ever started making \nvideos of it on TV. Hip hop has always been the most reliable mirror image \nof society since its inception, Sene, a rapper in Brooklyn, once said. \u201cIf \nyou don\u2019t like what you\u2019re hearing, it\u2019s a safe bet you don\u2019t like what you \nare seeing among the youth in the city.\" \n\n\n\nYour problem also seems to be \"how it's all so readily available to \nchildren\"...and what I'm saying is that with the internet there really \nisn't much that's not readily available to children these days. I know when \nI was growing up I definitely listened to a lot of the music my parents \nlistened to. Yes, the music was different back then, but my mom and dad \nalways made sure we listened to music together as a family on a regular \nbasis. Their love for Prince and the Ohio Players definitely made me \ninterested in Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and a serious lover of other \ntimeless music like Stevie Wonder and the great Bob Marley. Times are \nobviously different now but the point is, \"bad influences\" from the \nentertainment industry had always been an issue for decades and not only \nfrom hip hop...and parents just have to do their job and keep their \nchildren safe and not blame Lil Wayne who's audience isn't even supposed to \nbe children, for their own misgivings. Everyone is so big on blaming the \nindustry, Mtv, the rappers, the models blah, blah, blah...Maybe take on \nsome of that responsibility as a parent, older brother or sister. From my \nexperience it's best to focus on solutions and not problems. Rap music is \nnot going away any time soon, so best to just figure out how you personally \nwill deal with the existence of rap music and how it affects you or your \nloved ones. The music already has the words \"Parental Advisory, EXPLICIT \nCONTENT\" on it, maybe parents need to start doing their job and stop \nblaming Lil Weezy for everything. Raise your children, do not blame your \nchildren. Break the cycle, stop blaming the music."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w", "inappropriate_score": 0.72859744990892528, "authorDisplayName": "hud1231", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12jylgiiybxjfawm04cjbuponuovbpwuhs", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-05T20:26:21.866Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.58554200000000001, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-05T20:26:21.866Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MFc7nsWzovY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/7syS2LpnF3Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104225673499407483728", "textDisplay": "+Robert Nesta Marley!! well aware that there's other problems facing the \nblack community. well aware fox news spread racial bullshit. still doesn't \nmean listening to music glorifying violence, sex or drug use does not \naffect children how can it not. if a 8 yr old watches porn he' ll be having \nsex at a very early age. that's a fact.

In other words, there may be a statistical \nlink between, say, redheadedness and freckles, but being a redhead doesn't \ncause freckles to appear on your skin nor do freckles on your skin cause \nyour hair to turn red. The correlation is significant, but in this case \nthere turns out to be an underlying third cause in the form of certain \ngenes in people's DNA. Consumption of violent media, then, has not been \nproven to cause kids to act violently. Sorry to say, things are more \ncomplicated than that and I'm certain it all begins with the home where the \nchildren are brought up. BET and MTV have nothing to do with your child \nbecoming a rapist and murderer at all. And i don't know if we watch \ndifferent BETs or not but my kids never watch anything explicit from it at \nall. And I am black, don't know how that's relevant though"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w", "inappropriate_score": 0.77760497667185069, "authorDisplayName": "hud1231", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12jylgiiybxjfawm04cjbuponuovbpwuhs", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-05T17:27:04.425Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.25929599999999997, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-05T17:27:04.425Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MFc7nsWzovY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/7syS2LpnF3Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104225673499407483728", "textDisplay": "+Robert Nesta Marley!! what, parents step in when its too late when the \ngarbage has already brainwashed the kid? that's stupid have you seen the \nvideos that are played on TV? does grinding on dudes look censored to you? \ngirls poppin and twerking is fine? yeah....you're the problem. do you think \na kid looks up to their father more the little wayne? they'll respect their \nfather. but think about it....most of the time their father just a working \nstiff, living check to check. wayne's rich and just like you said all about \nthe money. do they want to be their father or wayne?? duhh!!

It has \nbeen going on since the 80\u2019s, maybe even before that. Many don't seem to \nrealize it probably because hip hop as a genre was never given this much \nair time as it does today to begin with. Most people that listen to those \ntypes of artists, understand that they\u2019re listening to a trap rapper. Or at \nleast, I like to think they understand. To those people, they don\u2019t want \nsomething lyrical or of any substance. They want something simple, with a \ncertain type of beat. People actively look for \u201cdumbed down\u201d rap music. \nNow, if these type of fans are aware of all of this, then they shouldn\u2019t be \nmad when somebody points it out to them. Kids who listen to the \"dumbed \ndown\" rappers only listen to the RADIO VERSIONS of their tracks on radio, \nBET and MTV. BET and MTV are so notorious for censoring anything even \nremotely explicit but they can't ban \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" just \nbecause it's doesn't have conscious lyrics or that it is not inspirational. \nNow if they go on and actively look for the explicit versions of this music \nthen the parents have to step in.

You \ndid not answer anything at all, all you've been saying is that Nicki is a \ncrap rapper (in your opinion), she acts like a hoe in her videos (in your \nopinion) and so kids (who aren't supposed to watch her in the first place) \nare following what she does and acting like hoes in real life (in your \nopinion)..all you've been saying is hip hop is full of vulgar and violence \n(that's what hip hop has been for decades) and it's making the kids resort \nto shooting each other in real life(in your opinion). but there's no actual \ntangible evidence to your stupid claims at all. I asked you why is it then \nthat crime rate in the hood isn't correlating with the rise in popularity \nof hip hop, you didn't answer. I told you that people get most of their \nmusic from the internet not from the censored version on radio and MTV, \nthat is supposedly hypnotizing all those black people into listening to \nNicki Minaj, because you think blacks don't have the mental acuity to know \nthat rap lyrics don't mean go and kill, it'll make you rich like me, and \nyou said was you don't believe that that's true even though I told you to \ngoogle it yourself and find out. With the movie analogy I was talking about \nFrank Lucas from American Gangster not Training Day....it's besides the \npoint though, but you say people were mad that he got an Oscar for Training \nDay just because the character wasn't a positive role model?? see what I \nmeant by \"imbecile\"? Anyone that was mad at Denzel getting an award for \ndoing his job very well is clearly stupid...and who was mad at Denzel \ngetting the award anyway? do you have articles, polls any evidence that you \ncan share or is another one of your \"facts\" that you pulled straight out \nyour anus? because I'm pretty sure everyone was impressed by Denzel's \nacting. Black people need positive role models on tv and movies? Right so \nwe should ban movies like the God Father and Scarface in the hood, it'll \nmake the stupid blacks kill each other more right? A movie is like a novel, \na poem, it's like a painting, it's a product of imagination and most movies \nare pure fiction and blacks are smart enough to know that actors are just \nactors, what they see on tv isn't what the actors really are in real life. \nSo an actor can be a role model regardless of what movie roles they take. \nLike I said white people listen to hip hop more but don't end up in the \nsame situation because they live in better neighborhoods, black kids in the \nhood resort to violence because they are in the hood not because of some \nstupid Gucci Mane song. If there was no hip hop, crime would still be rife \nin the hood and if the black kids didn't live in poverty they wouldn't have \nto resort to violence neither. Obviously this has been the greatest waste \nof time in my entire life...You clearly haven't the capability to prove \nyourself, you're just a hater with no insight, rap lyrics are literal to \nyou and because you're an idiot without anything intellectual to add to \nthis discussion, I'm just going to go, block any email notifications from \nyou, put on my headphones, listen to some NWA \"Gangsta Gangsta\" and move on \nwith more important things life. You go ahead on your futile mission (and \nyour guy Bill O'Reilly) of trying to fool people into thinking black people \nare dumb enough to kill and have sex because Lil Wayne or Nicki Minaj said \nthe words gun and fuck in their songs.

What point are you trying to even make there? lol. \nlike i said already, I named them as I was making a point about hip hop \nhaving been about vulgar and straight up no holding back talk since it's \nearly days which you should know if you were listening to the genre like \nyou claimed (remember when you first acted like there wasn't any female \nrappers other than Nicki Minaj but then you changed your stance when I \nlisted a dozen of them for you?) lol. Hip hop is what it is and it's been \nthat way so long anyone who hears the word \"rap\" would know exactly what to \nexpect, just like they would know what to expect in action , horror movies \neven porn, long before opening the tin so if anyone who feels like rap \nmusic isn't their thing they should go listen to gospel. I'm brainwashed to \nlisten to Lil Wayne? haha what are you smoking dude? Of course I have the \npower to listen to what i want to listen to 100%. I don't watch Fox News, \nlisten to country music, I don't watch horror, fantasy or musical movies, \nnor do I watch soapies, the baseball world series or Big Brother. I choose \nnot to. If I didn't want to listen to hip hop, i wouldn't, it's as simple \nas that. There are 100s of millions of Americans who don't listen to it \neither and it's because they choose not to as well not because they are \nexempt from some brainwash scheme. Whatever conspiracy theory about some \nsecret organisation \"secretly hypnotizing\" people to listen to Nicki fuckin \nMinaj is a figment of your imagination you fucking weirdo. There's no \nfactual basis to your claims which means it's only your personal opinion, \nit's all in your little conspiracy-theory-laden head and it's bullshit that \nno one else will give a shit about. Like I said Nicki Minaj being a crap \nrapper is your own opinion not mine or the many people that like her music \nand you can not impose your likes and dislikes on other people. Her being a \ngood or a bad rapper has nothing to do with girls in the ghetto turning to \nprostitution and having sex for money. \n\n\nWhite kids don't turn violent after listening to gangsta hip hop because \nthe ghetto isn't outside their window? So the black kids wouldn't turn \nviolent too after listening to hip hop *if they didn't have ghetto \nconditions outside their windows too right?* after all it's the gangsta \nlife/ghetto conditions that is the differentiating factor here right? You \njust answered yourself right there MATE...So what made the kids turn \nviolent all those hundred of years before hip hop and why hasn't crime \nincrease as the popularity of hip hop grew, since you claim to have \"shot \ndown\" everythin i said right...\"Acting like hoe\" is ACTING like a hoe, just \nlike Denzel acting like Frank Lucas or Marlon Brando acting as Vito \nCorleone doesn't mean they are literal gangsters...it doesn't mean Nicki is \nan actual hoe...and no... shaking her booty and saying the word vagina a \nlot does not make any woman a hoe... Women can wear bikinis, reveal as much \ncleavage as they wish and shake asses like salt shakers before anyone can \ncall them \"hoes\". this is the 21 century not the 1200s. this ain't an \nIslamic State where women aren't as free. The Southerners analogy is flawed \nbecause in our case I'm not saying hip hop has always been about vulgar and \nso it's good (or bad either, because that's not the point)), I'm saying \nit's always been about vulgar and people should know what to expect from \nit. It's not the same at all MATE lol...you can believe what you want, fact \nis if you do a simple google enquiry you'll find out the largest source of \nrevenue for music labels and artists, and keep in mind that whatever the \nsource of revenue is, it excludes illegal downloads and youtube et al...in \nother words you're the one full of shit"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w", "inappropriate_score": 1.2806830309498398, "authorDisplayName": "hud1231", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13he3aqoyblhxoeq235vh1jlp3exnqpb04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-13T01:14:12.544Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29457399999999995, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-13T01:14:12.544Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MFc7nsWzovY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/7syS2LpnF3Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104225673499407483728", "textDisplay": "+Bob! okay, I'm in the stone ages. but YOU'RE the one who keeps naming old \nskool rappers...not me. talking about \"the way its always been\".

Rap music and \nvulgar have been apart of each other long enough for people and especially \nparents to know what to expect whenever rap is concerned. Just as \ncondomless fucking has always been apart of porn since forever because \ncondoms are regarded as libido killers in the videos, vulgar in rap was/is \na raw method of painting a picture of the hood. Without it, the message \nisn't as punchy and without it no one would have listened to what black \nrappers like Tupac, Biggie, Nas, NWA et al, had to say. And no, vulgar \nlanguage listened to by adults and having always been that way is fine and \nis NOT THE SAME as when the southerners tried to justify discrimination by \nsaying that we've always been inferior. That's a piss poor analogy at best. \nThe only one *\"talking some dumb shit just to take up space to make it look \nlike they have something to say\"* IS YOU here dude. Any knowledgeable \nperson will read the comments and they'll see who is putting out actual \nfacts in support of their argument and who is the stupid O'Reilly-the \nracist, ass licking retard between the two of us lol. Anyone can see who's \nbasing their knowledge on mere fiction and who isn't:\n\n\n- *Your signature argument here is that I'm the sell out cuz I'm condoning \nthe so called \"dumbing down of black people by promoting hip hop music\".* \nWell no I'm not promoting hip hop, I haven't promoted Anaconda or PMW at \nall, if you can read English like I hope you can..I'm clearly just saying \ndon't blame the wrong things for the issues in the black community. \nPromoting hip hop would have been to say without hip hop, blacks would be \nworse off or something right? I'm not saying that Nicki Minaj twerking on \ntv is the best thing to happen to black people since MLK, no you're missing \nthe point, or you're ignoring it and...well, *saying dumb shit just to take \nup space to make it look like you have something to say*. I'm saying that \nNicki twerking on tv is irrelevant to the poin that even if she didn't do \nthose things, the hood would still be the way it is now since the rates of \nprostitution or promiscuity in the hood is a centuries old problem to begin \nwith. \n\n- Your second argument is that *hip hop makes the kids dumb and resort to \nviolence and promiscuity*...Fiction. Like I said music can't make any smart \nperson aka the black youth (so do we both agree that they are smart?), act \nin any way whatsoever, your character is what motivates you to be a \ncriminal. If a person decides to KILL SOMEONE it is not the music that's \ndoing it. If that were true then the same could be said for TV. I have been \nwatching Elmer Fudd try to shoot Bugs Bunny since I can remember. just have \na look sometimes at the cartoons/movies your kids watch. There's 100x more \nviolence depicted in them than any rapper could ever put in a song. The \nrates of crime and the rise of hip hop are not connected at all, there's no \nlink in the world, the link is only there in your Sci Fi loving brains \nthat's all. The data is available on the internet if you want I can link \nyou to it.\n- You go on to say *the media pushes bad music on to the children*...Again \n*Fiction*. And again like I said the internet is the new source of all \nthings media. Kids have access to porn and everything. With the Dark Net \none can access drugs, guns, underage nudies.... even fuckin hitmen. The key \nto it all is having parents raise their children properly and protect them \nfrom anything that may harmful to them, ermm like videos that begin with \nthe words Warning Adults Only, Sexual Content, or music albums that have \nthe label *Parental Advisory, Explicit Content\" perhaps...it isn't nuclear \nphysics to you right? Radios only put out radio versions of music and \naren't allowed to broadcast explicit during times when kids may hear it or \nsee it. So yeah FICTION\n\n\nThose are the basic things you've been saying all along, including of \ncourse the toppings and the dressings that don't make any sense at all. I \nnever said it's racist to say hip hop is bad for the black community, what \nare you talking about? I didn't even call YOU racist coz I'm guessing you \nwere not lying when you claimede you were black..how can you be racist to \nblack people when you're black. I did call you an uncle tom for blaming \nblack women for white celebrity on screen sexual actions though and I did \ncall O'Reilly a racist because we all know O'Reilly. When did I write a \n\"list of other bad music in other genres\" lol u mad bro? Read my posts \nthere's absolutely nothing that you can point out and call dumb, and \nobviously back up with VERIFIABLE data to show that it is in fact \"dumb\", \nyou don't debate someone by calling their statements \"dumb\" or \"weak\" \nwithout actually going on to prove why.

I never \nsaid the media was racist. their motivation is money. I said the media \nmakes dumb downed hip hop. they push it on black ppl, knowing white ppl \nwould follow cuz they do mostly everything black ppl do. but what about \nyou,,,if you say media is racist. why be a fucking meat puppet....Toby? you \ndon't have to be on that plantation anymore. shucking and jiving. I'm \nthinking you just like that dick up in your ass. why put money in the \n\"racists\" pocket?. who do I blame??? there can't be more then one person or \ngroup to blame? just more retarded logic.  point out where I said black ppl \naren't intelligent....you're constantly talking out your ass. I'm saying \nthe opposite of BET. I clearly know what a uncle Tom is...you're the one \nselling your own ppl out. I want upliftment in the black community. you \nwant to dumb down the black community. you condone turning little girls to \nstrippers and whores. this is what the white man wants and you oblige him. \nI said numerous times it would take more then stopping ignorant music to \nfix the problems in the black community. you mentioned liquor stores...if \nyou took out all the liquor stores, would it help all the problems? no, it \nwouldn't. but it's a start. what you don't understand is that it is a \nprocess. the problems didn't happen over night, nor will they be fixed \novernight...DUH!! \"parental advisory\" bullshit gets paid as much attention \nas a speed limit sign on the interstate. newsflash: there's a lot of bad \nparents that let kids roll with shit....what can I do about that? I didn't \ndo it...don't know why you're talking to me about the parenting jobs being \ndone. but when you think about it. it's our job to take care of our kids. \njust like Tyie Phoniex and Njeri earth say. they don't have cigarette ads \non tv for fear it would have kids smoke...they didn't say \"if the parents \nwould be parents then kids wouldn't smoke\" No..they did the right thing for \na kids. you must not have been a kid cuz I had good parents but since I'm a \nbig basketball fan...they couldn't compare to ballers. I bet most kids feel \nthe same way. kids love their parents but most of time it's an athlete or \nartist that has the kids saying \"wow\". so I guess we have big problems. \nit's hard enough being a parent without that bullshit constantly going \nagainst you. I saw your list of other \"bad\" music in other genres....which \nwas some weak ass bullshit...you just wasted your time writing another \nparagraph about that. saying hip hop is bad for the black community IS NOT \nRACIST, I REPEAT, SAYING HIP HOP IS BAD FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS NOT \nRACIST....SAYING THAT MAKES YOU A COMPLETE RETARD. I'm convinced you're \nassociated with the KKK or some type of white supremacist group. you can't \nget me to hate my ppl, you can't convince that playing dumb down music \nabout drug dealing,sex, crime and ignorance is good for the black \ncommunity.  and if you're from Australia, where there's not many blacks \nthere.

Cmon, \nlet a brother know will yah. Blame it all on the hip hop right? BET said \nthat blacks weren't intelligent and won't play conscience (conscious) rap? \nYes and that's exactly what you're saying here too isn't it? That blacks \naren't smart enough...haha so was Nicki Minaj right to say the media is \nracist then??? Me and Nicki know the media is racist already but seems like \nyou're not sure if they are or not and why... One minute you're blaming \nNicki for calling them out on it the next you're saying the same too..Like \nI said you don't even know what the fuck you're trying to argue, either \nyou're blaming individual artists for making dumb music, or you're blaming \nhip hop as a genre for making dumb gangsta music, or you're blaming the \nmedia for \"pushing out\" dumb gangsta music on to the \"the children\", or \nyou're blaming the black children for being uncle Toms (yeah you don't know \nwhat an Uncle Tom is clearly) for being \"programmed\" into choosing dumb \nmusic over conscious music. That's right let's be confused and not know who \nto blame so let's blame everyone, Nicki Minaj, hip hop, the media, the \nuncle tom kids. So what is it then \"gangsta\". How does this so called \n\"programming\" work anyway could you enlighten this dumb white Australian \nuncle Tom? (oxymoron right there)...The media doesn't push anything on \nanyone, the internet is the new source for all things media. People don't \nwatch music on MTV anymore, there's no music on MTV anyway. People don't \nlisten to radio anymore and even if they did both, it sure as hell won't be \nexplicit music, it will be radio versions all day..Your problem seems to be \n\"how it's all so readily available to children\"...and what I'm saying is \nthat people watch their music on the internet, on YouTube, they listen to \non-demand sources like Spotify and Itunes. What I'm saying is that with the \ninternet there really isn't much that's not readily available to children \nanyway. So it's up to the parents to enforce rules and prevent their kids \nfrom accessing it all...IT'S CALLED RAISING YOUR KIDS! If people wanted to \nlisten to conscious rap they can find it just as easy as they can find \nAnaconda...but they choose to watch Anaconda...not because anyone \n\"programmed\" them to but because most of them don't come from the ghetto \nand don't associate with what a typical conscious rapper talks about.\nPoint is:\n- There is bad music and good music in every corner of the world, people \nwill look for and listen to what they wish to look for\n- Fact is Hip Hop music does not influence bad behavior. Music does affect \nyour mood but it does not cause you to act inappropriately. Your character \nis what motivates your behavior in life. When you are growing up your \nmorals define you as a person and influences around you in your personal \nlife. \n- kids in the burb listen to and watch music and film that glorify \nviolence, sex and drugs just as much if not more than kids in the ghetto. \nKids in the burb watch porn and all kinds of explicit content more than \nkids in the ghetto, but kids in the burb go on to become doctors, lawyers \nand presidents more than kids in the ghetto. Hip hop is not the cause for \nproblems in the ghetto, in fact it's problems within the ghetto that lead \nkids to speaking the hip hop way, getting rid of hip hop won't get rid of \nthose problems to begin with.\n- Lil Wayne's content is very much influenced by the ghetto and where he \ngrew up and not the other way round. If anything everything you see in all \nthe videos originated from the ghetto. The drugs, the shootings everything, \nwas already there in the ghetto before Ludacris and Co ever started making \nvideos of it on TV. Hip hop has always been the most reliable mirror image \nof society since its inception, Sene, a rapper in Brooklyn, once said. \u201cIf \nyou don\u2019t like what you\u2019re hearing, it\u2019s a safe bet you don\u2019t like what you \nare seeing among the youth in the city.\" \n\n\nBlaming hip hop for black neighborhood problems is what the racist media \nlike Fox/Bill O'Reilly want you to do...they want you to not concentrate on \nthat senator or mayor that under-funds schools for their own benefit. They \nwant you to not blame their money generating gun stores and liquor stores \nas the problem, they don't want you to blame the racist police for \nincarcerating many more blacks for the same crime that many whites aren't \ncharged with. They want you to blame it on Lil Wayne! The racist media \ndoesn't put out dumb music so you can in turn become dumb, that's dumb of \nyou to say! If kids aren't going to proper school and getting a good \neducation then no conscious music would help them any way because it takes \nan insightful mind to make sense of what a conscious rapper like Immortal \nTechnique is saying in the first place! \n\n\nThe covers already have the words \"Parental Advisory, EXPLICIT CONTENT\" on \nit, parents need to start doing their job and stop blaming Lil Weezy for \neverything. If Weezy has more influence on your child than you, then we \nhave a big problem there, and it ain't Lil Weezy ;-) And the Australian \nshit?? Are you 12? Is that your signature argument here \"gangsta\" \nthat-thinks-he-knows-rap? What exactly does it prove in this argument of \nyours? that I don't know anything? How does being Australian prove anything \nmate you need to stop listening to your uncle Bill O'Reilly, he's a racist \nbastard and clearly you're his bitch."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w", "inappropriate_score": 1.5479876160990713, "authorDisplayName": "hud1231", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13he3aqoyblhxoeq235vh1jlp3exnqpb04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-09T03:16:10.091Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLyOaFQ_GoNToyFV5SYDk_w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.56734400000000007, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-09T03:16:10.091Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MFc7nsWzovY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/7syS2LpnF3Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104225673499407483728", "textDisplay": "+Bob!

Every single hip hop cover has had the label \"Parental \nAdvisory Explicit Content\" since the 80s, anyone that listens to hip hop \nshould know exactly what they are going to hear coz it says so on the tin. \nEvery hip hop track has a radio version and an explicit version, the one \nthat you hear on radio and on tv is the censored version..If you don't like \nexplicit content, vulgar or gangsta talk, then go listen to the censored \nversion and if you still have issues after then, then switch to gospel \nmusic or something. If you don't want your kids to listen to vulgar then be \na decent parent and prevent them from accessing the explicit content. An 8 \nyear old has no business listening to music that was intended for adults. \nAn 8 year old watching a video that clearly says not for kids, means he has \nterrible parents....the youth are old enough to talk about sex and drugs, \nso they are old enough to listen to hip hop, but don't lie to the people \ntalking about hip hop influencing those kids to gang bang and be \nprostitutes. if you think the black youth are so stupid and easily misled \nby a couple of 23 year old rappers talking about blings and bitches....and \nyou're black yourself then you have sickening inferiority complex, just the \nway your white masters want you to be...if hip hop is such a detriment to \nthe youth, then why does it not affect the white majority that listen to it \nmore than the black youth themselves, there's no evidence whatsoever that \nhip hop has any effect on the youth in terms of violence or promiscuity, no \nchild has ever turned into a prostitute after listening to Nicki and no \nchild has ever killed someone because they listened to Wayne rap about a \nfuckin pistol....And what the fuck is all that garbage about Nicki having \nno flow, having \"no rhyme skillz\"...Like I said that's your garbage \nopinion, I'm not entitled to agree with other people's opinions especially \nidiotic ones. my opinion is different from yours...I think Nicki Minaj has \ndecent flow and decent rapping skillz as seen in the tracks that listed to \nyou and you said kids don't listen to them..and why do you think people \ndon't listen to conscious rap more than the Anacondas and the PMWs? It's \nbecause they like what they like....it's not because they have guns pointed \nto their heads forcing them to watch Lil Wayne popping bottles. There's no \nevidence that shows Tupac talking about guns and bitches leads anyone to do \nanything, not even by a bit...The hood is plagued by drugs, police \nbrutality, unevenly distributed justice and families enduring the legacy of \neconomic oppression and subjugation, clear serious social problems that \nneed to addressed pronto, yet critics and sell outs find it easier to lash \nout at a 23-year-old rapper wearing bling and putting out a video showing \nbathing suit-clad beauties than to take on public officials who continually \nunder fund public education.

No you're the one who chooses to change my words. Never said Nikki \nmakes girls become prostitutes, stripper....yeah. u know what? Fuck \nit...yeah she makes them become hookers too. Cuz she's a hooker herself. It \ndoes matter how u got your success. If a drug made a lot money? Fuck him he \nmade money off destroying lives. Nikki makes a lot of money? Fuck her she \nmade money off destroying minds. Again so let's take a community, have all \nthem saying ignorant shit in unison to a song. This is good for all \ncommunities, they should make it a law. They should do that shit in church. \nWhat do think mate? A bloody ignorant wanker like yourself would go for \nsome shit like that. I don't believe you're from America. Yes it does \nmatter. and it matters if the kids don't hear the songs that you say are \nsoooo fucking motivating. Cuz we were talking about the influence of music \non the kids. I see u totally ignored the point I made about if an artist \ncan inspire the kids they also can be detrimental. Why is it, only some \nfake ass positive bs you're talking about effects the kids....but dumb \ndowned, ignorant, oversexed, drug dealing that played over and over again \nhas no effect whatsoever? Oh that's u talking out you ass. Damn, that put a \nbig ass hole all in your idiotic logic...haha....dummy. I never said not \nhaving ignorant music is the cure all. Its going to take a lot more. That's \nwhy used the term\"don't put gas on a fire\" meaning there's already a \nproblem, why make it worse with ppl fave rapper saying to do the same shit \nyou're trying to stop? this is a no brainer. Lets not feed the youth with \nconstant songs of drug dealing, crime and sex. Blacks are in jail cuz of \nliquor stores??? Really?And most guns bought in the hood by criminals \naren't bought at gun stores.... so Nikki has a song without vulgarity in \nit? Good for her...her mother should be proud of her. She can't spit, but \nnot cuz of the vulgarity. She can't spit cuz her lyrics suck, her flow is \nass, her cadence is lame, her punchlines are playskool at best. She's no \nrap artist she's a pop act. SHE HAS NO RHYME SKILLZ. I forgot to mention \nthis before u think I googled those rappers. So that fast I knew type \nPhoenix had a song called\"revolving door\" and knew what the second verse \nwas about? And she on that documentary I named. In that same amount of time \nI knew Njeri earth had a few about the music being feed to black youth. \nThese are strong black women denouncing (just like me) Nikki vulgar, trashy \nand oversexed music. Are they uncle Tom's are they sellouts? Fuck no, \nthey're black ppl who want the best for black ppl. They're mother's who \ndon't want kids subjected with constant trashy garbage. Don't you want \nwhats best for black ppl. Noooo. Cuz you're just as ignorant as mainstream \nrappers. Why the Fuck u keep mentioning Bill O'Reilly. I don't listen him. \nI thought this way about hip hop well before I knew who he was. And before \nI forget....I probably know way more about hip hop than.

Who said anything about hip hop \"saving\" anybody? haha \nYou missed the whole point entirely you desperate little dunce, the point \nis there's no direct correlation between the rise of hip hop and crime \nrate, THERE'S NO CONNECTION WHATSOEVER, the fact that crime is going up or \ndown or sideways has nothing to do with rap. Like I said, unlike sell outs \nlike yourself, the real black youth know the REAL reason 1 in 3 black men \nget incarcerated....the real Black youth know the real reason there's lack \nof opportunity in the hood, they know why there are liquor stores and gun \nstores in every corner of the hood, they know why the black man has been a \nsecond class citizen in America for centuries, they know it all and it \nain't because of NWA or fuckin Lil Wayne. Stop regurgitating everything you \nhear from Fox News genius. Bill O'Reilly is full of shit and don't let him \ntell you otherwise. Hip hop has conveniently been the perfect scape-goat \nsince the fuckin 80s, hip hop has been blamed for any and everything wrong \nwith the community but people are now aware of it..Judas' like yourself \nthat ignore the real issues and blame Nicki Minaj for fuckin prostitution \nare the problem because you're trying to keep us from keeping our eye on \nthe ball, trying to distract us from facing the real enemy, prostitution is \na centuries old problem that stems from far more complex issues than what \nNicki could ever do on a music video. Nicki could never be powerful enough \nto influence a smart and aware young black generation to think prostitution \nis the way to go....like I've said time and again, ask any Nicki Minaj fan \nthat considers her their role model WHY THEY DO SO, they'll tell you it's \nbecause of how she made it as a woman in a man's industry, how she owns a \nbusiness and how she's a millionaire in a sexist, racist world....none of \nthem will tell you they love her because she \"acts like a hoe\". That is the \nmost simple minded shit I ever heard and it denigrates and cheapens the \nstruggle for equality, never mind how it greatly implies that the black \nyouth are complete idiots...and that's what your dad Bill O'Reilly and his \ncronies are after, we won't be fooled though...\n\n\nI am sat in my room in Philly right now MATE and last I checked, it bang in \nthe middle of the United States of America... adding a \"mate\" at the end of \nsentence is just something I choose to do for personal reasons, I could add \nan amigo for all I care... means nothing, if it affects you any way, deal \nwith it. but like I said where I'm from is irrelevant, hip hop is music and \nmusic is for the world, I can be from Sudan, Poland or Argentina it makes \nno difference. Have you got something against foreigners or something? On \ntop of supporting Bill O'Reilly are you also a Trump fan?? lol do you think \nthat hip hop is only for Americans or that the struggle for equality is \nonly an American thing?

Because that would contradict his very \nnarrow view point of course, and that adds some gray area, which can't be \nallowed of course.\n\nWhat O' Reilly doesn't factor in is that in order for someone to influence \nthe outlook on life that these children have, they have to be able to \nrelate to them. If you try to have a privileged person from a well off \nfamily come to their school and tell them that they need to study and go to \ncollege, they won't listen. Why? Because they're aware of the different \nbackground. They know that they're environment sucks and is making it \nextremely difficult for them to follow that route. \n\nBut when you have someone like Nas, who grew up in the Queensbridge housing \nprojects during a violent decade (90s) in a bleak neighborhood with crime \neverywhere and cocaine running the streets, and who was able to reject that \nlife for a career in art (yes, rap is art), then you have someone who they \ncan relate to. \n\nAnd if you still wholeheartedly share Bill O'Reilly's view that ALL hip hop \nmusic is damaging to children then look up the music video for \"I Can\" and \ntell me that it is corrupting our children.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCkTGEOQMl_gFxG76K4EZw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Alexis Garner", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13fjbfxvsvcxnv4t04citdpctjbgxo45zk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-20T14:01:13.440Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTCkTGEOQMl_gFxG76K4EZw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.51448200000000011, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-20T14:01:13.440Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Qz4ygQG6c1o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAE98/MMSUgAONzp0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114399291820375816513", "textDisplay": "Or Queen Latifah U.N.I.T.Y or why didn't he use \"Pretty Hurts\" by Beyonce. \nOr use \"Murder to Excellence\" by Jay and Kanye?

We are \ntalking specifically about the hip hop genre. Films have been discussed \nbefore in other debates but thats for another video. Also we are comparing \napples and oranges when it comes to movies and music. To answer your \nquestion, my answer is No, I don't believe actors like Johnny Depp, Robert \nDi Niro, Jack Nicholson, etc are thugs in real life because they played \nthugs in movies. You know why? That is because they ARE ACTORS. Acting by \ndefinition (as an adjective) is temporarily doing the duties of another \nperson. Musicians on the other hand are not actors so many people, \nespecially young people take their messages seriously. It doesn't matter if \nthey are really thugs or not. Most rappers do believe in the lyrics that \nthey write. Tupac, Biggie, The Game, Lil' Wayne for example were all thugs \nin real life. All were in a gang, dress like thugs, talk like them etc. Why \ndo you think so many rappers murder each other? That's because many of them \ntalk shit in their music and they take that shit seriously.So do many of \nthe listeners that listen to them. I'm not saying that all rap is bad \nbecause I know there are some rappers who actually put out decent music. \nWill Smith and The Fugees, and many other come to mind. But the truth is \nrap (especially todays rap) has way to many negative messages in their \nmusic. You have even said it yourself that you wouldn't let your kids \nlisten to that kind of music.

I'm going to just ignore that point of your comment, since \nit isn't relevant to what we are talking about.\n  \"If it is true that poor white and black communities in Cleveland had \nrelatively equal amounts of crime, that is a distinguishing figure only in \nthat locale. The federal numbers take into account the total number all \nacross the nation.\" Although it is true that there could be multiple \nfactors that can account for the results, it still helps my point. It \ndoesn't matter if it is local, it still shows that where there is high \npoverty, there tends to be high crime. I understand that you think that it \nis only a correlation, however, look at it this way. If how crime truly \ncaused poverty, there would be a larger amount of impoverished areas. If \nyou are a robber, and you steal from an area that has money, and the area \ngoes to the dumps, you will eventually move on, therefor, the crime area \nwould spread. However, statically speaking, area of crime is normally \nconcentrated and hardly moves. Why is this? Because places that are not \nimpoverished have more resources to stop crime. Think about it, if you have \ntwo areas, one where the local police department is well funded, has all \nthe officers it needs to fully protect an area, then naturally, crime rates \nwill be lower because people are less likely to get away with a crime. \nHowever, if you have a police station that is underfunded, not nearly \nenough police officers to stop all the crime around them because of it, \npeople are going to have a much easier time getting away. This, mixed with \ntheir need for the money, drives them to crime more easily. You will rarely \n(it happens, just not nearly as much as in the impoverished areas) see \nsomeone come from an impoverished area into a well to do area, and steal. \nWhy? Because again, the well to do area has more resources, and they are \nmore likely to get caught.\n   \"Starting from the 1970s, studies in the US pointed more and more at the \nlink between unemployment, poverty and crime. After that other connections \nwith income level, time spent at school, quality of neighborhood and \neducation were revealed as well. Fresh research from the UK even indicates \nthat economic cycles may affect variations in property and violent crimes.\n\nBut most importantly, what reveals the unmistakable connection between \npoverty and crime is that they\u2019re both geographically concentrated \u2013 in a \nstrikingly consistent way. In other words, where you find poverty (minority \nneighborhoods) is also exactly where you find crime. Of course this doesn\u2019t \ninclude \u201csofter\u201d crimes such as corruption which causes massive damage to \npeople\u2019s lives but in a more indirect type of violence.\n\nIn the 1990s, the \u201cfirst wave\u201d (of immigrants) has rarely shown such \noutburst of violence. In theory the main difference with the first \ngeneration of these immigrants\u2019 children is that they have spent much more \ntime at school, as research has often concluded that education tends to \nreduce violent crime. (Source: \nhttp://www.nationaldialoguenetwork.org/poverty-and-crime/) However, if your \nschool is underfunded, and lacks the materials needed, qualified teachers, \nand directors, students are more likely to not come to class. \n  Excuse me if I find it hard to believe that poverty is a product of \ncrime, when there is so much going for the opposite. Besides. I grew up in \na very poor area, with high crime. I went to a terrible school and I saw \nhow the environment changes some of my childhood freinds. I've seen some of \nthe nicest people I have ever met turn to selling drugs, and stealing just \nto help their families. I can honestly say that the same would have been \nfor me if I hadn't been lucky enough to have awesome mentors who guided and \nfinancially supported me. No race is inherently more violent than another. \nBut every human being will do what they believe to be necessary to live. \nThat's why I referred to the  Cleveland source. To show you that its not \nall about race. Now as for why the numbers of crime are higher among Black \ncommunities. There is a higher percentage of Black, communities that are \nliving in poverty in America than there are whites. Because poverty leads \ncrime, there is naturally going to be a higher percentage of blacks \nengaging in crime. So you where correct. STATICALLY Blacks are about 2 \ntimes more likely to commit a crime than Whites, however, it is not because \nthey are naturally more aggressive as most people seem to believe.

Only your first source is truly relevant, \nand non-ideological, so let's go with that one. If it is true that poor \nwhite and black communities in cleveland had relatively equal amounts of \ncrime, that is a distinguishing figure only in that locale. The federal \nnumbers take into account the total number all across the nation. There may \nbe a host of factors contributing to the equality of crime rates in those \nspecific communities which do not apply to the nation as a whole. Secondly, \njust because poor areas are correlated with more crime does not mean that \npoverty is causing crime. It could be that crime is causing poverty, for \nthat matter.\n\nThese kinds of results only mean that \"correlation\" is revealed by the \nstudies -- \"causality\" is nearly impossible to prove in the social \nsciences, so anyone  who claims to know what causes what is an ideologue or \nengaging in speculation. I would agree with you that in that specific \nstudy, according to those numbers, the crime rate among black and white \nneighborhoods was found to be equivalent. To then say that such a local \nstudy invalidates the official FBI numbers is not a compelling argument. \nNational vs local? National is more descriptive. The rest of your \"fact \nsheets\" (talking points) are aggregated for the like-minded, not hard data \nintended for serious researchers. \n\nMy point is that nationally, black crime is twice as high per capita as \nwhite crime according to the FBI. (I never said what causes that to be the \ncase, because any speculation would be nearly impossible to prove.) So if \nblack crime is twice as high as whites, then it makes sense that blacks \nwill see more engagements with the police, naturally, and there will be \nmore black deaths. In fact, I discovered that I was wrong about that point. \n \n\nHere is an official department of justice statistical table proving that \nnation-wide black deaths at the hands of police are not as disproportionate \nas tends to be claimed by people such as yourself. \n\nhttp://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ard0309st.pdf\n\nA summary:\nOut of all police arrest-related deaths from 2003-2009\n\n42% White\n31% Black\n\nI was very surprised to find this. In fact, more white people are killed by \npolice each year than blacks despite the doubled rate of black crime!! If \nanything, white people should be marching in the streets. Do you have any \nnational numbers that show anything different? Otherwise, I think you'll \nneed to concede that your premise is false.

Later, Miranda Lambert made similar \nwaves with her song \u201cGunpowder and Lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cFancy\u201d\nReba McEntire\nWhy it was controversial: Even 20 years after it was first recorded, some \nlisteners were still shocked by this song\u2014about a destitute mother who \nsends her own teenage daughter into prostitution\u2014when McEntire covered it \nin 1991.\n\n\u201cThe Thunder Rolls\u201d\nGarth Brooks\nWhy it was controversial: Brooks\u2019 lyrics dealt with another illicit topic \nin the conservative country world: Infidelity. The song, about a cheating \nhusband, comes to a gruesome climax in the third verse, in which the \nbetrayed wife pulls a pistol on her two-timing spouse.\n\nRock\n\nThe Prodigy \u2013 \u201cSmack My Bitch Up\u201d\nThe Prodigy released in 1997 its album \u201cFat of the Land\u201d. The song \u201cSmack \nMy Bitch Up\u201d instantly gained popularity, putting the band on every \nnewspaper\u2019s headlines. This song evoked drug use, sex, vandalism and \nviolence, told from a first-person view; that of a young woman.\n\n\nRage Against the Machine \u2013 \u201cKilling in the Name\u201d\n\u201cKilling in the Name\u201d is indeed one of the most controversial songs of all \ntime. When Rage Against the Machine released its album in 1991, featuring a \nknocker on the U.S military industrial complex, police violence, and \ninstitutionalized racism\n\n\nMichael Jackson \u2013 \u201cThey Don\u2019t Care About Us\u201d\nMichael Jackson raised multiple controversies throughout his career. When \n\u201cThey Don\u2019t Care About Us\u201d was released, within the album \u201cHIStory: Past, \nPresent and Future Book 1\u2033, the world was stirred.  The song contained \nanti-Semitic lyrics like \u201cJew me, sue me, everybody do me / Kick me, kike \nme, don\u2019t you black or white me.\u201d M.

We are not \ninfected with hiv, raped or robbed anymore than you are; only the news, \ninterested in maintaining the status quo doesn't mention all the kids \nwhites molest, or the 20 million drug addicts you have(about half hard \ndrugs) or how studies show you are more likely to abuse drugs than Black \nPeople.  Whites buy 10 times more rap than we do and imitate it at least as \nmuch, the degree to which they do so depends on economics, but you might \nwant to look around.  White trash is swallowing you up.  Even the term \nwhite trash is racist, because it is only given to you.  You get to \nseparate your good white folk from the dregs, and then turnaround with a \nstraight face and say your righteous in judging everyone else by theirs.  I \nhad a run in with your people the other day, sagging no shirt and yelling \nho at a lady passing by, both on the way to get meth.  Also another \noccasion one of your \"Good White Sistas, laughed at me when I told her \nAsians are the smartest race as a whole.  Imagine that, even your smart \npeople can't keep up with Asians, but your dumb people think they are \nsmarter than them! Someone lied to you and I hope you don't get stuck in \nthe trap, being white makes you god and you have no more work to do.  That \nthinking is why the world is flying past you!!!!  Can you guess the most \neducated Ethnic group in America?(Hint: white people aren't in the top 3) \n\nYou can only blame a person for what they are responsible for.  Slavery, \nand stealing a continent, I don't know how the Indians feel, but now you \nclaim to be civilized(white culture I mean), yet do not attempt to make \namends for the sins of your father., until Repair-rations have been made, \nthere will be a valid reason to blame white people.\n\n Do you know what 20 Trillion dollars does for Infrastructure?  Probably \nnot, but you use it everyday and then deny white privilege.  Look at it \nthis way If success is at the top of a building/sky whatever.  What harm do \nyou do to a person whose ladder you stole?  Then imagine the benefit of \nadding that ladder to yours.  WE are working with the ladder missing half \nthe rungs you added to your ladder which is 400 years of blood,sweat and \ntears with no compensation.  Even still, the accomplishments are \nstaggering, Black President, Best Pediatric Neurosurgeon in the \nworld(Presidential candidate), list goes on.\n\nWhile I don't care if you subscribe to you white supremest ideology after \nthis conversation, I am interested in a better world, so I just wanted to \nimpart my thoughts on the subject, which are based on actual facts, not \nwhat the nightly news tells me is true.  God Bless You, if you are a \nsincere person, and if your not he won't.  Which reminds me, Your white \nscientists say man started in Africa, so God is Black based on being made \nin his image, then how would his son be lilly white?  If you can imagine or \nresearch the depth of racism that still exists you will get a hint of why \n\"Black Trash\" are such easy targets, doesn't matter to me either way, but I \nwould like another Brother in truth.  Because I don't agree with criminals \nof any color LEAST OF ALL BLACK!!! \n\nIf you read this Far I appreciate the effort anyway!!!

Look to blame the hip hop culture on is to me \nunfair and just ridiculous. Look music is art, art is expression, these \nrappers or musicians make art relevant to their lives. I guess I was the \nonly one who learned not to take this shit that seriously and that you take \nthe good and leave the rest. I've never listened to a song about selling \ndrugs and decided I wanna go sell drugs. When a rapper is referring to a \nhoe he's not talking about your everyday JANE he's talkin about women who \nwant to take advantage and use him for his money. I'm sorry disagree or not \nbut that's a hoe. When they tell how they used to sell drugs they trying to \nhelp paint this vivid picture not to glorify to show you how scary and real \nit was. It's funny Jay can say \"Hov did that so hopefully you won't have to \ngo through that\" but that's lost. These are artist not musical puppets like \npop stars or country stars who just sing the same songs about love and \nbeing this everyday person that's a lie and not to say all rappers tell the \ntruth but it's a bit dis in-genuine for a musician to constantly make music \nover and over and over about being this regular person when in fact that's \nnot true. I rather the boastful, cocky and arrogant truth about your life \nthan that bullshit because it's socially acceptable. I think there is a \ndisconnect though because there are those who don't understand this is art \nthis a show this false this is all apart of an act if you will and when a \nrapper puts out a new album and acts a certain way it's essentially like \nperformance art. That's part that's not getting through to the young people \nwho listen to this. But when we want to tell people to start lying in their \nart which is essentially when it comes to hip hop autobiographical art I \nthink we as people society and consumers need to check ourselves. We don't \nneed music to survive it's an art form it's subjective and people like mr \no'reily kevin powell and juan williams have no place using this as \npolitical platform to get tv time.    \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYqS-VWUeDZJzKpLq-koqEg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "mrinformado", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z131it2j4ljwz5jto22jsf4hqyygzlnvn", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-11T18:29:10.766Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYqS-VWUeDZJzKpLq-koqEg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.64517200000000008, "formal_score": 35, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-11T18:29:10.766Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101708961581268669743", "textDisplay": "you are a flake and a social statistic, fads are for flakes! much love from \ncompton."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd527FUFIevynjvd3uT-hsA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "BabyFacedAssassin301", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z131it2j4ljwz5jto22jsf4hqyygzlnvn", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-13T12:59:30.648Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCd527FUFIevynjvd3uT-hsA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.65420600000000007, "formal_score": 89, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-13T12:59:30.648Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112057860820075812019", "textDisplay": "Agreed\nYou can use these same criticisms with any form of music and pretty much \nall popular forms if entertainment"}}]}}}
