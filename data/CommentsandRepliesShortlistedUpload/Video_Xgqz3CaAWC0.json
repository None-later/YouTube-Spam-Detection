Thanks for all the great work. \n FYI:  These \"Truth about\" episodes are interesting, but almost like \nmuck-raking in some regards.  I only made it five minutes into this video \nand quit when the emphasis shifted to MLK's plagiarism.  Does it not seem a \nbit Ellsworth-Toohey-like to produce these episodes denigrating great \nhistorical leaders in order to make them seem \"more human\" to us aspiring \ncommoners?  I wonder if it might be a greater service to humanity to allow \nthese characters some grace, and overlook their relatively petty flaws in \nrespect of their greater feats of leadership and perseverance.  Criticizing \na civil rights leader for plagiarism while downplaying the organized crime \nmachine of slavery, extortion and racketeering he came from seems almost \nunethical.  Where in the great book of morality does it say one must cite \nthe original author of every sentence written or spoken in deference to the \noriginal authorship?  I understand university papers aren't supposed to be \nplagiarized, but the matter in contention is one of passages, not pages and \npages.  If BU's professor's let it slide, it's not exactly Dr King's fault \nnobody held him to a higher standard in the awarding of his Doctorate.  I \ndidn't hear you denigrate the Dr's professors at BU.  Is that because they \nweren't prominent black civil rights leaders?  \n\nI'd rather learn more about the extraordinary feats of accomplishment of \ngreat characters in history than spend time studying trivial petty \nshortcomings.

That\u2019s consistent with desiring reparations and \nconcessions, and it is exceptionally, though not utterly, nonviolent. \nBelieving in Rule of Law is not widely considered advocacy of violence. \nYou\u2019re splitting some fine hairs.\n\nViolence is hard to eradicate. Government monopoly on violence represents a \nconsidered attempt to put limitations on violence, which, thus far, is the \nbest we've been able to do. I think it naive to believe that eliminating \nthe State would eliminate violence.\n\nPeople who never owned slaves benefit from the profits of slavery, while \npeople who never were slaves suffer from the economic and social tolls of \nslavery. A person\u2019s relationship to slavery does not have to be immediate \nto be very real; reparations are one avenue for redistributing stolen and \nhoarded wealth that has passed, through inheritance, to those whose \nforebears stole it. Might be the best avenue, might not be, but it\u2019s far \nfrom ridiculous. We have been redistributing wealth by force, in the form \nof taxes, since the passage of the United States Constitution. Of course we \ncannot entirely resolve slavery, since we cannot turn time back to undo it, \nbut that does not mean we should make no attempt at tilting the balance of \ncircumstances towards justice. \n\nThe reality that King was not a consistently admirable father and husband \ndoes not negate the important contributions he made to the progress of \ncivil rights in his country. That he was not faithful to his wife, that he \nplagiarized, these are widely known facts. Despite these serious flaws, we \ncan still acknowledge his positive influence and his remarkable \nachievements. Thomas Jefferson was no saint, either.\n\nSaying that people must be considered *more important* than machines is not \nequivalent to calling for a ban on all computers and farm machines. It is \ndiscouraging that you label King economically illiterate and an idiot \nsimply because he held different economic beliefs than yours. Many highly \neducated and intelligent economists are Social Democrats.\n \nThe question about paying water bills in a world that is two-thirds water \ncan be taken rhetorically rather than literally. King talks about \nrestructuring society so that all people have access to essential common \ngoods. Many smart people consider access to water a human right and are \nconcerned about ownership of the world\u2019s potable water by private \ncorporations or others who can deny access to something folks will die for \nlacking. It is true, of course, that the two watery thirds of the world do \nnot provide endless drops to drink. That\u2019s not the point.\n\nYour argument that nonviolent protests of racism, at great personal risk to \nthe participants, represented nothing more than thinly-veiled power grabs \nstrikes me as witheringly dismissive. It rings of the often repeated claim \nthat America\u2019s Civil War was primarily about states\u2019 rights, rather than \nabout slavery, another reductive theory.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12sjtgyambcvvk3322ohnrautipunixz04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZUYTN2807r9mWB-ivfPy9A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GKcLGeKnBhE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/gFu94CGl_Ro/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "FuriousFatMan", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-21T16:06:06.522Z", "videoId": "Xgqz3CaAWC0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZUYTN2807r9mWB-ivfPy9A"}, "sentiment_score": 0.42286399999999996, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-01-21T16:06:06.522Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104491285103439384135", "textDisplay": "\"communist. a jewish communist? can't be....\" -stefan\n\ni know right? seems you cant talk about communism w/ out talking about the \njews that invented it. odd.\n\n:D\n\n-FFM\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13wtta55qnrwvqix04cedrwplnpwjwhayc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 3, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0yDLxLvC_1nEe_R0Nlsy3g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yZSglZR_fVs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEo/BEuGHdm1Mw0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "daniel cdc", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-13T01:41:42.711Z", "videoId": "Xgqz3CaAWC0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0yDLxLvC_1nEe_R0Nlsy3g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.78379200000000004, "formal_score": 98, "updatedAt": "2014-11-13T01:41:42.711Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108312103191110739962", "textDisplay": "this man is a self serving  whistle blowiing fraud...... no man could have \nmade the sacrifice he made.... point that high profile finger back at your \nself..... you racist crook\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0yDLxLvC_1nEe_R0Nlsy3g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "daniel cdc", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13wtta55qnrwvqix04cedrwplnpwjwhayc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-02T07:24:43.230Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0yDLxLvC_1nEe_R0Nlsy3g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.67968999999999991, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-02T07:24:43.230Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yZSglZR_fVs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEo/BEuGHdm1Mw0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108312103191110739962", "textDisplay": "You are envious of Martin Luther King Jr and his greatness. ..."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0yDLxLvC_1nEe_R0Nlsy3g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "daniel cdc", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13wtta55qnrwvqix04cedrwplnpwjwhayc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-02T07:23:24.630Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0yDLxLvC_1nEe_R0Nlsy3g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.041708000000000023, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-02T07:23:24.630Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yZSglZR_fVs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEo/BEuGHdm1Mw0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108312103191110739962", "textDisplay": "Put them on your filthy level. .

If he \ndidn't do that I would have just thot he was \"being negative\". \n\nI now understand that *some people* are demotivated by heroes with shiny \nimages and some are not. So, it's okay for me to not be motivated by what \nhe has done here. In fact, I am so demotivated that I stopped watching. His \nmessage is not universal. I think he needs to understand that. \n\nI don't have a problem with being in denial about people who are shiny (the \nshorthand word I'm going to use for people who have a very impressive and \npositive public image). Of course these people are normal humans like many \nof us out here and they are all going to be contexted inside of their \nculture and many other things which may be very different than my contexts. \nFor me, that is a given. What I need from heroes is the pure message. The \npeople and the message are not the same. I get that. So, this information \ndoesn't sully the message that I'm taking away from my consumption of this \n\"image\". \n\nWhat I see most of the time, however, is people who use this info to engage \nin \"ad hominem\" - which is an invalid and illegal form of debate and is \nattempting and intending to lower the value of the message by lowering the \nimpression one has of the messenger. People do it all the time in public \ndiscourse and I try not to give it any of my time.\n\nKing is a popular target for ad hominem. So is Mother Theresa. Alot of \npeople *want* their impressions of these people to go lower. Religious \npeople are easy targets. An example of someone who is not a popular target, \nbut who has just as much ammunition to offer, is Steve Jobs. Too many \npeople *want to* worship him for his flaws to be happily traded. Doing so \nwould make it impossible to prove that you are not just trolling. But at an \nindividual scale, all of this is just trolling. The oldest form. \n\nThere are some people who I do need to be impressed by. That is how the \ninfection of inspiration and motivation *begins* to spread. So, information \nabout their flaws *will* effect the Message. But only in the beginning \nstages. I can tell if I've transcended hero-worship when I learn something \nnegative about someone I admired, and I can drop them and keep the Message. \n\nSo, since I do have a religion and these types of discussions offer nothing \nto me in the way of motivation, I'm going to ignore this and other posts \nlike it. The Message is still pure for me - regardless of who it is \nattached to and what their personal flaws are. The Message motivates me and \nwhen King speaks it, I feel motivated. I don't feel demotivated the way \nthis guy does.

They act like white crime \ndoesn't even exist unless it's a school shooting.\n\nYou're only legit beef is that they focus more on White on Black crimes \nmore so than vice versa.  That's for two reasons.  Blacks are already \nvilified in the media, so it's redundant.  Also in the past Whites have \ntaken violent action against blacks in the on a mass scale.  Where Blacks \nreally have not done that on a mass scale.  We just attack each other.  So \nit's too dangerous to hype up Black on White crimes. \n\nThey focus so much on black crime on purpose, that they feel good about \nthemselves when they report a Trayvon Martin type story and vilify the \nGeorge Zimmerman, or vilify the celebrity who says the N word.  It balances \nout for them. \n\nThe media is far from anti-white.  To win an Oscar if you're White just \nrequires you to be in a decent movie and be a big name.

First you are projecting your current \nknowledge of the government and the world on to MLK. It is wrong to assume \nthat MLK knew exactly what you knew especially since he lived in a time \nwhere information was not so easily obtainable as it is today. To claim \nthat MLK wanted the government to get more powerful and make things worse \nis assuming his knowledge of how the government works is at the same level \nas your own.  It is most likely that he fully believed that what he was \ndoing would help bring an end to racism and bring equality to the country.  \nAs a supporter of communist MLK most likely fully believed the biased \ndoctrine he was fed and thought that it would help create his views of \nequality.  Finally you argument that because he knew violence would occur \nfrom his protests he supported violence is incorrect.  While he definitely \nknown the outcome of sit ins and marches he is not responsible for other \npeoples violent actions.  If I told you to fuck off and you hit me in the \nface would you blame me for the assault because I insulted you?  I think \nnot.  His protests were a way of not only showing the racism in the system, \nbut how the government's solution of violence is wrong.  The police are the \nones that broke US and moral laws by using excessive force, murdering, and \nkilling peaceful protesters.(I know protests were not always this one \nsided, but it was MLK's intentions that they would be)  Most if not all of \nthe protesters also knew the risks and still volunteered.  As far as I know \nMLK never claimed that protesters would be safe and actually led them to \nbelieve they would be attacked and imprisoned.  Thus since protesters \nconsented and knew the risks he was not responsible for their harm or the \nviolence done to them.\n\nNow I must agree that you should call MLK was ignorant(he probably did not \nthink he was), and a hypocrite many times over.  I can agree that his ideas \non how to solve racism and inequality were fundamentally incorrect, but I \nthink it is very arrogant for to assume that MLK meant malice with his \npolitical actions.  If there is proof of this then I will retract my \nstatement, but I think it is unlikely.  If he had lived longer maybe he \nwould have apologized for his mistakes.  Maybe he really was just kind of a \ndick and knew exactly what he was doing.  For better or for worse we will \nnever know.\n\nI would like to finish by saying intentions do mean a lot.  Over my 27 \nyears on this planet I have been a Democrat, Communist, Liberal, \nRepublican, Libertarian, and finally an anarchist.  Even though I have held \nalmost every point of view my end goals has always been the same.  I have \nalways been interested in whatever system would lead to the least poverty, \ndeath, and would lead to the highest advancement for humans.  People can be \nlead astray by false information, but that does not necessarily make them \nbad people unless they break their own moral code.  Even though it seems \nyou think he meant malice with his actions I doubt he did.  I think his \nideas of nonviolence and equality were a good message that he can be \ncommended on.  But we should most definitely learn from his pile of \nmistakes to make ourselves better people.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z133w5xxkrn5xdt0c22pun54uo3wsbgg204": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYHM8X1jWBQDCQOLYL7seA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xyhghVtzKgk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIs/09yDxRt-Z24/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ted Lewis", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-30T15:44:36.573Z", "videoId": "Xgqz3CaAWC0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaYHM8X1jWBQDCQOLYL7seA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46337600000000001, "formal_score": 63, "updatedAt": "2014-04-30T15:44:36.573Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116403281397454656302", "textDisplay": "So what!

Molyneux notes that he did not \nconfess to these actions at any point in his life time despite knowing that \nhe had done wrong, but it seems obvious why he didn't. Even if MLK \ndesperately wished to atone for those misgivings, one could easily imagine \nhow much it would tarnish his reputation and diminish his efforts, being \nthat he was one of the foremost figures of the civil rights movement. Much \nof the content of this video is also merely opinion and conclusions drawn \nfrom these opinions. Just because Molyneux believes that MLK's desire to \nreceive government reparations is flawed does not mean he is revealing \"the \ntruth about Martin Luther King.\" He also claims that Rosa Park's refusal to \nsit in the back of the bus \"wasn't a protest against racism, but a protest \nagainst government laws.\" It was, of course, a protest against both. \nGovernment laws and racism went hand in hand very often at that time, so I \nquestion how much Molyneux has truly examined some of these conclusions he \nmakes. It is indeed difficult to trust the credibility of somebody who \nclaims that Rosa Park's did not protest Racism. He makes a distinction \nbetween government and the rest of society when there isn't one this \ncontext. He fails to recognize that by protesting societal constructs, she \nwas also protesting the government. And just because these constructs are \nimposed by the government does not mean that the rest of society does't \nplay a part, nor does it mean that it is somehow a mistake for MLK or Rosa \nparks to expect the government to do the right thing and have a role in \natoning for what they did wrong. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13rt51xdmbte1mzy04cez2i3szqgd4r55o": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYdlCFs2TqQR0nmKlmJQIdw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-99AQn9vhqfE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABB0/aAA6i_6KqBM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.13568521031207598, "authorDisplayName": "Procommenter", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-06-09T15:31:46.886Z", "videoId": "Xgqz3CaAWC0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYdlCFs2TqQR0nmKlmJQIdw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.019671999999999967, "formal_score": 93, "updatedAt": "2014-06-09T15:31:46.886Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107008506864088096597", "textDisplay": "*It takes a village to pillage as Western humanity balances on this \nestablishing dialogue from the 1942 movie **Bowery at Midnight** between \nheat-packing ruffians (who were no strangers to the pit-a- pat of gun fire) \nmeeting for the first time: Frankie Mills: \u201cWhat are **you** afraid of?\u201d; \nStratton: \u201cDon't get gay kid just because you're handy with a heater.\u201d*\n\n*Edward Mandell House to Woodrow Wilson:*\n*\u201c[Very] soon, every American will be required to register their biological \nproperty in a National system designed to keep track of the people and that \nwill operate under the ancient system of pledging.*\n\n*By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which \nwill affect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency.

Two people I have always had a lot of respect for (based on \nwhat I knew of them) was Ghandi and MLK. While your video on Ghandi was \nvery eye opening and radically changed how I viewed him, I find this video \nless so and would even go as far as to say that you are being quite unfair \non MLK here. Like with Ghandi, you have pointed out some definitive truths, \nbut while you successfully exposed serious flaws with Ghandi as a human \nbeing including cruel and racist traits, with MLK you have made too many \nleaps and assumptions regarding his intent, ideas and ideals. I also think \nyou have focused too much on the less relevant aspects, like his sexual \nactivities or his ties to communists (I also disagree that communist should \nbe equated to Al Qaeda, unless you refer to how they are regarded by the \nmainstream populace). Like you, I detest affirmative action and racial \nquotas but am not entirely convinced that MLK was pushing for the these \nthings. Aside from the quotes you mentioned, I find little evidence to \nsuggest that he supported the things you said, particularly the government \nenforcement you mentioned (which I feel is a good example of you making a \nbig leap regarding MLK's intentions and ideals). Maybe I am showing \nignorance and maybe I am guilty of refusing to let go of my reverence for \nMLK as quickly as I did with Ghandi, but I don't think you have given MLK \nenough credit for where he was right and perhaps have stretched things a \nbit when pointing out his wrongs. That's not to say that you didn't open my \neyes on many faults of his character and made many pertinent points, and of \ncourse I understand the value in seeing the full rounded truth of his \nhumanity. While I understand that MLK was far from a perfect human being, I \nstill feel respect is due to a man who spoke for more truth and justice \nthan most from this time and place. Just as I don't agree with everything \nyou say, but respect much of what you stand for, I feel MLK deserves to be \ncredited with more than plagiarism and adultery.

Just to clarify my comments regarding communism \nis that it was, back in MLK's day, demonised by the media to excessive \ndegrees. In fact part of the reason communism is looked at with more \nsympathy today is due to a recognition of the over the top hysteria that \nsurrounded it in the past. I am not a fan of communism but my point was \nthat equating it to Al Queda is stupid in my opinion. I know many people \nwho support various socialist or communist ideologies that are good \nhearted and while they may be misguided in this belief they are certainly \nnot evil. I don't agree with communism but many people who have socialist \nideals have them based on good intentions and are attracted by the idea of \nequality and community. My issue with Stefan's indictment of MLK because of \nhis links to communists is part down to the fact that I disagree that being \nfriends with communists is akin to being friends with Al Queda, MLK \ndenounced communism on many occasions and while media may have gone on the \nopposite direction in recent times, during MLK's era the anti communist \npropaganda was almost hysterical. But as I say, I am not a fan of \ncommunism, just don't think equating it to Al Queda is rational.\n\nI agree with Stefan's contention that many of the problems with the state \nare based on the socialist aspects of it, though it is the state imposition \nitself that is the main problem.\n\nMy personal issue with both communism and capitalism is that neither have \ntruly manifested themselves. The virtues of capitalism is the freedom the \nfree market is supposed to promote while the virtues of communism is based \non the ideals of equality and collective support. The problem is we do not \nhave the virtues of either systems. The modern state is a combination of \nthe worst aspects of both. The cut throat competitive nature of capitalism \nwith out the freedom it is supposed to provide, just as we get the \nimposition of socialist control with out the equality that system is \nsupposed to promote.\nJust as capitalists would argue that true capitalism hasn't actually been \ndisplayed, as many of the flaws of our system are related to state control, \nwhich isn't inherently a capitalist issue. Communism sympathisers could \nalso argue that the so called communist states that have existed are not \ntrue embodiments of that ideology. The fact that they all were under \ndictatorships is a good example of something that actually runs counter to \nthe communist ethos.\n\nI too hate the state and agree with much of what Stefan says about the need \nto be free from state violence. Give me anarchy over the current system any \nday, and give my anarchy over all other systems that have existed and do \nexist.\nI totally agree that we should be free to chose what system we wish to be a \npart of and contribute to. Personally the only law I accept is the common \nlaw ethos of prohibition against causing harm or loss to another. Any other \nlaw outside of that mandate is by definition fascism and even laws with in \nthat ethos have the problem of how can their enforcement be funded with out \nstate coercion in the form of taxes. I, like Stefan, would much rather live \nin a world where such systems were more like a charity, where funding and \nsupport is entirely voluntary and no imposition is put on those who wish to \nhave nothing to do with such systems.\n\nI fully understand the need to reveal the full humanity of those we revere \nand flaws should not be hidden. I just felt that this video was less \nobjective than other videos Stefan's made and by his high standards was a \nbit of a disappointment. He seemed to favour FBI over MLK in many \ninstances, which I found very hard to understand. When it comes to the FBI \nvs MLK there is no doubt in my mind who's side I would be on and a lot of \nleaps and assumptions against MLK were made in this video. I felt he \ndeserved a bit better. He was obviously a flawed human being, as are we \nall, but he still ranks as one of the good guys in my opinion in the grand \nscheme of things. Stefan has shown some unusual sympathy to the state on \nsome occasions, I noticed similar tendencies with his \"truth about \nFergusson\" video which I was also disappointed with.\nI do agree with 90% of what Stefan says and stands for but just as we \nshould heed his advice not to elevate people and be blind to there flaws I \nthink it is important to do the same with Stefan too."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNdT_37NfuoFrOp6XB1Zy_w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Matthew Sands", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z123ivr4rlukjdyvh23whhehor3ogxdnb", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-12T13:27:18.654Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNdT_37NfuoFrOp6XB1Zy_w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.59313400000000005, "formal_score": 7, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-12T13:27:18.654Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106311785942564086593", "textDisplay": "+Russell Barlow From my point of view it seems that people are not reading \nmy comment before responding.

A lot of shady people may have \nassociated themselves with MLK and he himself was not a perfect person but \nI don't think this video was as fair and objective as I would expect from \nStefan.\nI don't honestly know all the things that were said in sexual escapades of \nMLK, though the FBI's attempts to spy on this part of his life says more \nabout them than him for the most part. And there is no evidence that MLK \nhad anything to do with any murders (correct me if I am wrong) so again \nsuch things would be unfair to bring up when assessing his character. \nStefan's videos are titled the \"truth about\" so I think he should stick to \nwhat is definitely truth.

I was just pointing \nout that the \"facts\" are not as damning as they were for Ghandi. I have \nproperly changed my view of Ghandi after learning many of the things about \nhim that demonstrate cruelty and perversion. I don't think the same is true \nof MLK and the facts given about him are far less damming IMO. I don't \nthink he is a saint, nor did I before, and was already aware of some of the \naspects mentioned, like his links to communism or sexual activities. But \nwhile Stefan revealed some real traits of cruelty and borderline pedofilia \nfrom Ghandi, it seems the worst he can say about MLK is that he engaged in \nsexual debauchery (with consenting adults) and was guilty of plagiarism in \nhis younger days.\nThe communism links are not something that concerns me that much and are \nnot so well established either. Do you really agree that communism is or \nwas equivalent to Al Queda? Because I don't and know many good hearted \npeople who have many socialist ideas. Also MLK denounced communism on many \noccasions.\nWhile Stefan has given some quotes and actions of MLK that suggest he \nsupported affirmative action he neglects to mention many quotes and actions \nthat suggest that he would not, so I don't think it is unreasonable for me \nto remain unconvinced that he would support this, though I accept I may be \nwrong.\nBasically, all I am saying is that there are one or two leaps made here by \nStefan. The Ghandi video stuck to cold hard facts and demonstrated a lot of \ncause and justification for labelling Ghandi a bad man, rather than just an \nimperfect one. This MLK video shows many flaws in his character but I don't \nagree there is enough to call him a bad man.\nI agree his sexual escapades make him a bad husband but I still feel he was \na good man at the heart of things and appeared to be genuine in his fight \nfor equality and freedom for all people, not just black people. I am open \nto being educated and, as I said, have genuinely changed my view of Ghandi \nbased on the facts presented to me, but I am not hearing a strong enough \ncase against MLK. Too much of it is based on assumptions, rather than \nfacts, and too many of the facts are less relevant examples of his sexual \nweaknesses. The adultery thing for example is a bigger crime in Stefan's \nhead because of his own ideals, but does it make him a bad person? Not in \nmy opinion. It shows him to be weak and flawed but it is not enough to call \nhim a bad person.\nI think the point of Stefan's videos is to discourage hero worship and to \nremind us that even the most revered are deeply flawed. In the case of \nGhandi he actually demonstrated enough info to show Ghandi as a bad person \nwith real cruel traits and self serving hypocrisy. In the case of MLK he \nhas revealed some real flaws to show that he is far from a saint, but has \nhe demonstrated that MLK was a bad person? No, not even close.\nOne of the main reasons I respected MLK is because, despite the mainstream \nview of him being a figure for black people's rights, his words and actions \nwere often about equality and justice for all. The establishment wants us \nto remember MLK as a champion for black people when the he was mostly a \nchampion for poor people. Stefan is reminding us that, regardless of \nwhether he is revered for fighting for black people, poor people, or all \npeople, he was a very flawed human being. That is fine and I accept that, \nbut he has not built a case that convinces me that MLK was a bad person.\nMaybe I am wrong with my assumptions about things like affirmative action, \nmaybe Stefan is wrong. My point is that much of this is assumptions rather \nthan cold hard facts.\nMaybe I am guilty of refusing to let go of my reverence for MLK. I am \ntrying keep my mind open to such change, and did not have a problem \nchanging my view on Ghandi after hearing some very damming information \nabout him.\nJust as we should not blindly hero worship people like MLK or Ghandi, we \nshould also be careful not to be guilty of doing the same with Stefan. \nRather than treating Stefan's words as the words of God, we should be \nprepared to challenge his view when we feel it is appropriate. I respect \nhis view but the same lesson he teaches with regards to figures like MLK \nshould be applied to him and we should be prepared to challenge him and his \nviews, I would expect him to welcome such things.\nYour brief appraisal of my comments seem quite close minded and dismissive \nand I don't expect you to even read my rather lengthy response, but I would \nbe interested to hear Stefan's view on what I have said if he ever comes \nacross these comments."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC301IX4GCutIhkUFD75MLOg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Derek Marlowe", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z123ivr4rlukjdyvh23whhehor3ogxdnb", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-01T03:49:53.723Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC301IX4GCutIhkUFD75MLOg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.012883999999999951, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-07-01T03:49:53.723Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116761959856319324845", "textDisplay": "The facts speak for themselves.

It's arguable and silly to think that middle class \nblacks are less productive than middle class whites.  I would think middle \nclass blacks have to work harder and be twice as productive just to get \nwhere they're at because a sizable portion of white people are inherently \nracist.

Lower \nclass Mexicans are more productive than everyone and will take over what \nwas once for lower class whites.  So I'm not quite sure it will be blacks \nwho are the only ones worse off.

instead claiming \nthat they would rather not \"dignify\" the question, coming from a \"racist.\"\n\nThat stance is an obvious side-step, and it impresses nobody. The questions \nare simple: Why do blacks continue to align themselves with those who would \nrather seek reparations than remedy the underlying problem of black \nculture?  Why are blacks so appallingly backward, violent and destructive? \nCan blacks ever take accountability for their own actions, or is it always \nabout white Americans with their \"unearned entitlement\" and \"oppressor \nculture.\"\n\n\"Racist\" has lost its power to shame.  I am a racial realist, and here's \nthe reason: You cannot ascribe blacks the same qualities you can for \nwhites, Asians, Latinos, Semites or other humans. \n\nListen to how ridiculous this sounds: \"Blacks should be credited for all \nthe good they do in communities.  By being such good neighbors, they only \nenhance the communities they populate.  Black schools are wonderful \nbastions of learning, given the high standards that blacks require of \nthemselves and the dedication and discipline it takes to succeed among \ntheir communities. Blacks are so law-abiding as to make policing \nsuperfluous. They are wonderful examples of intact families, and black men \nlead the way in being good fathers and being role models for their sons and \ndaughters.  Blacks are a model of an industrious people, who have given the \nworld incredible advances in the fields of medicine and science, and their \ncities and civilizations are wonders to behold.  Is it any wonder that when \na young couple of any race is deciding where to live, the first place they \nchoose is among the blacks?\"\n\n\"Dignify a response>\"  Niggers, just clean up your own

I'm starting to understand \nexactly what the problems is with your viewpoint. You act as if the state \nis its own entity to which people willfully relinquish their freedoms when \nthey feel as though they need to be protected. You mentioned in the \nScandinavia video that corporations are not people, but are in fact made of \npeople from whom taxes are extorted in the form of the corporate tax. So, \nthis would imply that a corporation is a particular amalgamation of people, \ncarrying human flaws and representing those flaws proportionately; things \nsuch as greed, apathy, etc. However, when it comes to the state, which \nshould be viewed very similarly, as a group of people with human-based \nflaws, suddenly the state becomes its own entity, as if it were a natural \nantagonist to humanity and can therefore never be viewed positively. \n\nMy point is this. You automatically assume that any attempt to correct the \nsystem to which we submit is futile because the state itself is the \nproblem. The state is neither inherently good or bad. It's made up of \npeople, with the same moral strengths and weaknesses of people. And only by \nspreading the messages of morality can we hope to strengthen society \nmorally, which will then flood over into the government.  The government is \nsimply a sample of society. Is government the problem, or is our own nature \nas human beings the problem? And if that's the case, can nurture override \nnature so as to produce a better society? And would that society then mold \na better government in the future? Those are the questions we should be \nasking. My problem with libertarian philosophy is that there's a breakdown \nof logic right at the core when antagonize the structure of a state as \nsomething beyond the reach of reasoning. A state is very much a human \nthing, and to address all of the problems within the state is to take a \ndeep look at ourselves and recognize everything wrong with us. Government \nis a tool, and it's up to people, on the whole, what they choose to do with \nit. When the masses are unaware of this, the few who can then utilize the \ntool for their own well-being at the expense of others, hence the corporate \nsocialism we see today. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI_qwr4ufV2_DsVEBTb9AIA", "inappropriate_score": 0.26281208935611039, "authorDisplayName": "TheAntiStatesman", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13avpjropzcyxj0n22ngjajbxvmeh5gb04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-19T15:53:11.371Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCI_qwr4ufV2_DsVEBTb9AIA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29737199999999997, "formal_score": 95, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-01-19T15:53:11.371Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hkFOfktdHUM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB4/Rjyus4PkjEY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101492491955337258984", "textDisplay": "States are made up of people, yes. They are a human construct, yes, but \nthey also serve as a monopoly on violence in a given geographical area. The \nsame cannot be said for companies in a purely capitalistic sense. In a free \nmarket companies would conduct themselves in ways that are non detrimental \nto their employees and customers, because if they don't, well, those people \nalways have the choice to go to the competition.\n\nIn our current statist la la land, companies are state subsidized and state \nincorporated, and are just tools of the state and part of aforementioned \nmonopoly on violence, hence the rampant crony \"capitalism\"  (or corporate \nsocialism, as you put it) we see today. But such a construct only exists \nbecause the state exists. Its like a mutually beneficial parasite-host \nrelationship that only serves to fuck over the rest of us because there's \nreally no incentive not to. Such incentive would only exist in a free and \nopen market which is not controlled by a violent monopoly.\n\nYou say to look inside ourselves to see the problems of the state. I call \nbullshit. Governments are staffed by power hungry individuals, many of whom \nare likely to suffer from grave personality disorders which completely \nnegate their capacity for empathy. Thats just how it is. Those are the \ntypes of people who seek and maintain power. Just look at history. These \npeople are not like you or I.\n\nThere really is no individual choice in the matter. Voting is a fraud, spun \nup by your psychotic masters to give you the ILLUSION of choice. Its all \nsmoke and mirrors. Have you ever seen government shrink or de-regulate \nitself in any measurable manner when a D wins out over an R or vice versa? \nIf you are a logical person, I would expect that your answer would be a \nresounding NO. And the next logical realization would be that no matter who \nanyone votes for, the government will always grow.\n\nGiven that, the logical next step for many libertarians or anarchists would \nbe the complete philosophical abandonment of statism in favor of the non \naggression principle and voluntaryism.

These endowments are as \nintimate a part of a person as is their Soul, a \"direct connection\" with \nthe Divine. But, if God Over All (go outside and look UP - view the micro \nto macro systems all around you that provide yhe means for YOU to BE; none \nof which any man has created ANY of the land, water, air, sun in the sky or \nstars beyond...and science says NOTHING can be duplicated in a vacuum \nwithout a PURPOSE FOR ITS CREATION...how many molecules are similar? Stars? \nGalaxies?) doesn't have any \"papers\"on our Souls how do white folks figure \nthey can weasel in and PLAY Creator?\n\nYou don't view Negroes for what they really are: Prisoners OF War exiled \nwith amnesia forced upon them via heavy duress. We are the single largest \nfactor in the creation of the greatest economic empire in your recorded \nhistory - and we do while being beaten, raped and even murdered.\n\nFrom Trayvon Martin, to Oscar Grant to the NEXT child hunted down for \nsport, this evil pattern has gone on since 1452 and if the FACTS are not \nexamined will continue on for centures more.\n\nMLK and Brother X did not know these facts, but they were CLOSE. Close \nenough for the USA to KILL them for it, and no Negro \"leader\" has the guts \nto speak of freedom for OUR People FROM white folks since.\n\nYet all we need do today is look up the WORD \"Negro\" in any good \ndictionary. We then SEE it derives from \"Nigri,\" which a lie has been told \nit mans \"black\" in Latin - trying to the couch the Eurocentric view that \nthey somehow invented this FOR us...when in fact \"atrum\" is the Latin word \nfor black, and Nigri was known to the Romans via their greatest mapmaker, \nPtolemy's \" masterwork \"Geographia.\" (Published 2nd century ADE)\n\nHis data on his scribes is so advanced it depicts the general shape of my \nhomeland, over a dozen centuries before any other European was the wiser!\n\nWhy is all this important? Because the US Congress identified Nigritia as \nour lawful juridictional Nation (the pirates kept \"detailed files...to \nsteal a line fron the \"Terminator\" movie) to record WHO and WHAT they were \nattacking and, to ensure everyone got their proper cut from the ill gotten \ngains...or hadn't you ever thought about what \"taxation without \nrepresentation\" came from?\n\nHave you wondered why, if Negroes come from \"Africa\" a slur againgst then \nis \"Nigger?\"\n\nBecause Africa was a Senayorial Province of the Roman Empire, from 146 BCE \nto approximately 395. ADE.\n\nIt is where Tunis is now, and is NO PART of the sub-Saharan sector of the \ncontinent. This term was revivrd by the Holy Church of Rome in the 15th \ncentury, when the Pope gave orders to the monarchs under his control to go \nsteal the wealth of my People and make them slaves so they can never come \nback with a rightful claim of their property. That Prince Henry the \nNavigator of Portugal had brought back upwards to 70 shiploads of gold, \ngiving his church 10% \"tithes\" (7 shiploads of gold was more than all the \nothet monarchs of Europe had COMBINED at the time) had nothing to do with \nit...\n\nThat Plato is known to have come to Nigritia and stayed and studied our \nform of governance for 15 years, going back to Greece and teaching his \nstudents our principles...\n\nAnd they, lazy louts, made a badtardized version called \"Democrasy\" or \n\"majority rule.\"\n\nWe dis something quite different and FAR more effective. We simply worked \non a problem until it worked out for EVERYONE. Imagine your Congressional \nsessions having THAT happen.\n\nNigritia, when reported back to the Bishops and Monarchs of Europe, was \ndescribed as far more advanced than their own civilization.\n\nNigritia operated very much like the US of A today, in that it had separate \nsovereign sectors of various sizes yet all had equal station. Nigritia held \nwithin it entire empires, kingdoms, tribes, peopled, villages and \ncity-states (Greece stole that too).\n\nNigritia is identified as the formet name for the region of the Soudan (do \nnot confuse this with the lies published as \"countries\" which were all made \nup out of the \"partitioning\" of \"Africa\" (used as a term to hide crimes \nwhen in fact lies were being told by your church leaders that we were \n\"savages \"ethics\": heathens, infidels, pagans) who by God their wealth is \nbetter served to be in the hands of the more capable...justification for \nthe atrocities of piratical warfare from the very top down and condoned and \nsupported rvery since) out of their Berlin Conference of 1884.\n\nNigritia was recorded in almanacs at the turn of the 20th century as having \nthree Divisions, Northern and Southern Nigritia, and the kingdom complex of \nSokoto-Bornu.\n\nFunk and Wagnall's states \"Nigritia extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the \nRed Sea, south of the Sahara; typically known to be between the tropics of \nCancer and Capricorn.\"\n\nSmith's Dictionary of the Bible (the four volume set by which all the red \nmarginal notes derive) states \"The original language and culture of the \nEgyptians was Nigritian. A Hamatic admixture came later...\"\n\nStolen?\n\nWe were in our last great era when Europe was learning how to READ!\n\nDo NOT include Negroes in YOUR society a this is a falsehood of great \nmagnitude. Negroes - including STILL make this mistake. We try to integrate \nourselves into something that munches us the moment we are born...because \nTHAT is all we know.\n\nAnything not the truth is a LIE. If the truth will set us free then we must \nnot be working WITH the true. And so the problems persist. The reason? \nGreed. Avarice. Not hatred as one is lef to believe.\n\nThe venom from white folks - including their false pretense of feigned \n\"dignity,\" is measured by the VALUE we have to creating PROFIT for them \nwithin their current societal structure, and the Creator provide resources \nthey continue to separate us from and steal from us.\n\nNegroes SHOULD be the richest Peopke on earth!\n\nThe \"N\" word slur is NOT against an individual but IS an instant \nidrntifcation of one regime's horrid transgressions against a fellow NATION.\n\nSeems every race on earth can have their own Nation BUT the Negro...\n\nThat's not true. This ALL has been verified by te President, Secretary of \nState, Congress, FBI, and CIA of the USA, challenged in US Superior Court \n(we won) and sanctioned by the IN Security Council.\n\nWhat does all this mean? It means the institutions, war machinety, agencies \nand agents of the USA have NO LAWFUL JURISDICTION over Nigritians.\n\nIt means over 40 million Nigritian babies born within USA borders are not \n\"subject to\" taxes, police, courts and jails.\n\nNigritians are SOVEREIGN - just like your \"Queen Mum\" is. You give away \nyour power to proxies (police, soldiers, preachers, politicians, judges, \netc.) that then hold YOU hostage.\n\nYou are afraid we will learn and then USE our true power, for, if we can do \nall that has been done in bondage, imagine what we can do AS a FREE People!\n\nSomehow, the speaker, using very wise and calm terms, MISSED ALL OF THIS...\n\nDo not rebutt, please. Just go do your OWN research. This information is \nnot hard to find, although \"poltical correctness (ie whatever the current \npopular erroneous view is) is whitewashing the records...\n\nGo LOOK up \"Africa\" in any encyclopedia published before 1970...\n\nGo look up Nigritia and Negro in the Oxford Dictionary of the English \nLanguage, the multi volume set...\n\nGo look up \"black\" to see it is the single worse word you can curse some \nwith (\"evil, foul, doomed, full of despair, insidious, treacherous, dirty, \nfilthy nasty, etc...\") and iy has been ASSIGNED to us!\n\nBut, understand, this is NOT \"our\"language, and like every other aspect of \nyour societu, it is used as a wrapon to secure continued profits and \nbenefits from our toil and suffering.\n\nOnly 10% of the total USA population we make up 80% of the prison \npopulation.\n\nIn California (I'm the Oakland, CA Mayor's Mentor of the Year Awardee, \n2013, the FBI's 5th highest crime city) they test 3rd grade Negro males in \nmath to predict how many prison bed they will need by the time they are old \nenough to drive.\n\nPrison labor in the new private Prison-Industrial complex accounts for a \nwhopping 40% of the annual Gross National Product (GNP) of the USA.\n\nNegroes generate over ONE TRILLION dollars annually - making them one of \nthe top DOZEN buying powers on earth, get havr no assets, no industries and \nge nothing in exchange for their huge volume of purchases.\n\nThe are \"cash cows.\" Chattel slaves.

In 1868, blacks and Whites \nwere 50-50 in terms of population, by 1948, it was 75-25. The last 21 years \nof ANC government proved the Afrikaners fears legitimate: industries were \nnationalized and turned over to ineffective, corrupt black political \nclients; Whites, especially farmers, have been systematically targeted, \nbutchered, rape, murdered; the ANC still remains a black supremacist \norganization that openly sings \"shoot the Boer\" songs in 2015; and Whites \nare completely subordinated to all of this in a state their ancestors \norganized and built. Look at what happened in (Rhodesia) Zimbabwe; now \nafter killing and dispossessing all the White farmers, Zimbabwe's starving \nand wants their White farmers black, lol...  As for Jim Crow, it made sense \nfrom a business perspective: White southerners didn't want to be around \nblacks so businesses catered to that very strictly. You can make an \nargument that in public accommodations, black facilities were less than and \nthus violated, \"separate but equal\"  but to mandate racial integration for \nprivate property is to eviscerate freedom of association and private \nproperty rights in general. \n\n\nThe biggest blow to black prosperity wasn't some CIA crack conspiracy \ntheory, it was the 1965 immigration act and the tidal wave of low-skilled \nworkers, legal or not, that displaced the black working class over the past \n60 years. Drugs are a problem, but they weren't as much of a problem when \nblack men still had work opportunities -- and didn't have to compete with \n50 million Juans from South of the Border -- and the nuclear family was \nstill intact. \n\nBuddy, most White Americans are a mix of European ethnic groups. My \nfather's side is old-stock English/Scottish and has been in North America \nsince 1648. I actually have ancestors that fought in the American \nRevolution and the Civil War (Union cavalryman) so, yes, I can claim a \nconnection to the \"we\" who fought the Civil War  -- and incidentally \nprovided you the right to sit on your black ass and lecture me about how \nevil White people are, ffs. So your whole argument about me using my \ndepigmented skin to undeservedly appropriate an identity with American \nhistory that my family wasn't actually a part of just completely fell \napart. Nice try, though. \n\nAs for my advocation of a return to Africa, I guess I just take the words \nof black Americans at face value. If life in America has been so difficult, \nso hard, so discriminatory, so unbearable, and held back an immensely \ncapable class of people, then why not return to your ancestral homeland and \ntruly exercise self-determination in a continent increasingly devoid of the \nevil White oppressor? I just find the constant, advanced victimology of \nblack Americans baffling. It's just like feminists; they self-style \nthemselves as strong, independent, capable actors and then in the same \nsentence complain about societal forces and oppressors that are too great \nfor them to overcome. And thus, they need society to perpetually subsidize \ntheir efforts in empowerment. It's contradictory, dishonest, and inane \nlogic. \n\n\"And it is in government that black people have always had their own \nproblems, because it has been, and it continues to be the use of \ngovernment, mostly by white people, that have made the bad problems in \nblack communities worse\"\n\nHence, my point about leaving a country where you will never be the \nmajority population and therefore never predominate in government. Oh wait, \nyou actually benefit immensely from living in a 1st world country. I'm \ntired of this rhetoric. I don't think in world history you can find another \nexample where a population (White Americans) have bent over backward so \nmuch to enfranchise and empower a formerly enslaved people. It's altruism \nto the nth degree and still your not satisfied. Luckily, however, the \nattitude you present is increasingly irrelevant as Whites are rapidly being \ndispossessed by non-European immigrants and the claim of White dominance \nrings more hallow each day. Whites of my generation are starting to realize \nwe've been sold a raw deal, and that like Latinos, Asians, and Africans we \nhave distinct ethnic, racial, group interests as well and most pursue them.

So yes, black people have a host of social problems, but whites \nplayed a large part in contributing to these problems. And finally, who are \nyou to tell black people to go back to Africa.

I should know because unlike your unsubstantiated fear of white \nAmericans today, nearly the entire Ukrainian part of my family died in the \ndisastrous genocidal collectivization policies of the Soviet Union during \nthe 1930s, which resulted in the Holodomor. Yep, that's right, black \nAmericans don't have a monopoly on suffering; frankly, black Americans were \nprivileged compared to what my Ukrainian side of my family was enduring \nunder Soviet communism. Moreover, the fact he couldn't differentiate \nbetween a faux-egalitarianism, such as communism, which eventually leads to \na ruthless combination of political and economic domination and \nmonopolization by a small political bureaucracy, and actual social and \neconomic freedom granted by classical liberalism is both frightening and \nprecedent.\n\n\nAs for your claim that \"white racists\" or \"white authority\" are/is somehow \ntelling (or forcing) black men to impregnate, on average, multiple black \nwomen out of wedlock then commit disproportionate amounts of violent crime \nthat winds them up in prison unable to support the multiple children \nthey've had resulting in 77% of black children growing up in single parent \nhomes is complete nonsense. There's actually a sizable portion of blacks \nwho do succeed in \"mainstream\" America, which btw is increasingly diverse; \nthis isn't 1960, half of U.S. children under 18 are non-white, and \nAsian-Americans, who faced similar racially discriminatory laws in the US, \nnow make more per capita than white Americans. So this narrative of \nperpetually racist, evil \"white\" America \"holding back\" and or making it \n\"impossible\" for blacks to succeed is just your own, self-justifying, \nethnocentric propaganda. Its also pretty hilarious you talk about how great \nPresident Obama while by your own logic, the status and opportunity of \nblack Americans has remained the same under his very leadership. Great job \npointing he's done nothing for poor blacks besides, of course, creating a \ncostly, inefficient pathetic excuse for \"healthcare\" reform.\n\n\nIt's honestly painful to hear the commonly held political and social \nopinions of black people; you literally are stuck in a slave mentality \nwhere no one but \"great leaders\" like King Jr or Obama can save you from \nthe \"evil whites\". The greatest irony though is that your \"great\" leaders \nalways recommend using the same institution, Government, that put your \nancestors in chains in the first place; and then, of course, whenever \ngovernment wealth redistribution doesn't work, nor alleviates all the \nsocial problems within the black community, you convenient blame whites for \nall your problems. I swear, we should've repatriated all the slaves back to \nAfrica after the Civil War, it would've saved us so much trouble."}}]}, "z12jt1s4apngz3cu4221gdmgntbmcvy2q": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg_I0ePO8jnKpeouRfzFMOA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "dextr79", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-20T19:30:12.860Z", "videoId": "Xgqz3CaAWC0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCg_I0ePO8jnKpeouRfzFMOA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.79919600000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-01-20T19:30:12.860Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100958429957495524592", "textDisplay": "Haha, after Mandela and Ghandi, I was actually waiting for this one to come \nout. :D Too bad I can never do a performance of Don Henry's song \"Beautiful \nfool\" with a straight face anymore, but oh well...\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13iw5wiwxvms53ry04cdnkj2lenfd2wji0": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJQmCBU7j8y4Zb3G36fCEGw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-knoFwA8YtZM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOE/b2iMW-sYeaI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "eric mfoula", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-20T10:37:39.520Z", "videoId": "Xgqz3CaAWC0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJQmCBU7j8y4Zb3G36fCEGw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.027735999999999983, "formal_score": 36, "updatedAt": "2014-05-20T10:37:39.520Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115320055247801377423", "textDisplay": "About reparation.

It was changed on the books, but \nwhen I grew up in the late 1900s early 2000s segregation was a part of \neveryday life, My school was like most schools self segregated.  If you go \nto a horrible school district you get a horrible education regardless of \nrace, so how did he change anything in any significant way for people as a \nwhole. The wealthy class mostly white live in good school districts.  So \nwhat did he really change?  In my book he changed things for the worse   \nYou still have the same slums as you did in the 60s if not worse now.\n\n I have had class's with black people and I hated it.   MLK made me go to \nschool with those people, most of them were loud, unruly people with little \nclass, they are mostly dysfunctional and for the most part are ignorant \npeople that do not want to learn.  These people can not be helped. They are \ncontent with who they are and how they act.   If you think I am racist read \nwhat Malcolm X had to say about his own black people.  I am no more racist \nthen he is about his own people. I am sure MLK stood for the same thing as \nMalcolm X it was nonviolence vs. violent means to achieve their goals.  \n\nEvery now and then you get a needle in a haystack like Barack Obama that \nhas class.  He is educated and was well raised. You can understand him when \nhe speaks. These kinds of people are few and far between.  Most of black \npeople are ununderstandable, and when they do speak its some kind of jive \ntalk.  I wish Martin Luther KIng did not exist because then would not have \nhad to go to school with those people, and its as simple as that. You get \ndown into the real world and stop living some mainstream media propaganda \nlie where we are all holding hands and you see the world for what it really \nis.\n\n Liberals talk a good talk but when it comes to them and the schools they \nsend their kids to its a private school with armed guards and they live in \nprivate fenced in communities with little to no diversity as they speak \nabout diversity and how its so good.  How come they spend so much money \ntrying to get away from diverse communities.  Dont take my word for it \nwikipedia some of these diverse towns where the median income is 150k to \n200k a year and the towns are 95% white.  Yeah thats the truth and yeah \nthats where they live in Diversity and diverse schools,  Bull shit!!!!!   \nLying scum bag political bull shit!!!    \n\nHey I can sit here and lie, just like them, but why not just tell the \ntruth. If MLK was alive today he would probably live in a gated community \nmake 20 million a year in speeches and have multiple illegitimate kids and \nhang out with Jesse Jackson and Jesse Jackson Jr., and Talk about \ndiversity.         \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12qftor1xzsylagp04cf3qruvnltjara1g": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 25, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC3L8QaxqEGUiBC252GHy3w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9ifro6l4eVI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAoY/dFmr6ZdIC74/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Stefan Molyneux", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-20T15:35:33.418Z", "videoId": "Xgqz3CaAWC0", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCC3L8QaxqEGUiBC252GHy3w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.7534479999999999, "formal_score": 69, "updatedAt": "2014-01-20T15:35:33.418Z", "likeCount": 70, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105416475244874554281", "textDisplay": "A very important look at Martin Luther King, Jr.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgesmy_ynb7k13IaMDJ9_Tw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jack Mehoff", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qftor1xzsylagp04cf3qruvnltjara1g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-01-24T07:48:16.014Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgesmy_ynb7k13IaMDJ9_Tw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9007400000000001, "formal_score": 51, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-01-24T07:48:16.014Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115168702760222203111", "textDisplay": "I accept your argument.

And \"perspective\" has \nmore to do with the latter two and less to do with the Actuality that you \nhave decidedly accepted as your \"perspective\" that of which you \"can not \nescape\". You say it's not easy there at the seniors' home but as they say, \nnothing worthwhile comes easy. The question becomes is it possible for you \nto perceive this \"inevitable downward slide\" as a perspective of darkness \nthat is indeed worthwhile and needs to be Embraced rather than \"escaped\"?\n At first, this may seem an uncomfortable notion to consider, let alone \naccept and integrate into your life but hear me out.\nI mentioned in my previous comment about my volunteer services at those in \nneed of support at a local hospital. I also admitted the struggle that on \nsome days I face with that service. But what I didn't mention was the \ndarkness I was thrusted into and have had to endure for the past 7 years as \nI watched my beloved life partner battle with the degenerative disease of \nmultiple sclerosis and witness how it's effects has ravaged her from her \nonce former independent, active, full of energy, life, laughter, joy, \nbeauty and youth to her present state, bedridden, virtually completely \nparalyzed, practically 100%\ndependent on me to make sure that all of her even most basic daily needs \nare met. But I remain by her side and will never leave her. Till death do \nus part. My love for her braces me through the darkness and the despair \nthat I feel at times. It is this embracement of our circumstance that in \npart helps me do my voluntary work at the local hospital. The \"darkness\" \nonce embraced helps me transcend. I now in each waking day and moment try \nto take nothing for granted. Fresh air....the breath of life....the taste & \nsmell my food...I take it all in...including the hurt suffering and \ndespair... all.\nI fast, meditate & pray...I also yell, scream and hit things...I accept my \nflaws and pursue my strengths while living and doing the best I can.\nThere is a time for fasting...for consciously withdrawing for what we take \nfor granted including our health and life itself. (old ppl our elders in \nretirement homes)...\nA lot of suffering isn't consciously chosen  but often imposed on us (eg. \nloss of loved ones, grieving, abandonment, the inevitable old-age \nassociated illnesses, burn victims or other victims of other accidents or \ncircumstances that result in physical and/or psychological illness .) but \nwe do have a choice in the way we respond to it. The commonly quoted \nSerenity Prayer reminds of that: \n\"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\nThe courage to change the things I can,\nAnd the wisdom to know the difference.\"\n\nSo in those cases where we often have little choice about what happens to \nus and we can NO LONGER take for granted those things that we took for \ngranted before, perhaps the \"mystical\" dimension enters into it through our \nability to respond to it. We may not as the cliche goes \"get to the other \nside of it\" (however one wants to interpret that ) and there may be long \nperiods of despair and darkness at first but perhaps (some will attest to) \nthe only \"way out\" is by seeing a greater hope or something else that lies \nbeyond....this creates the condition that brings about the proverbial \n\"bigger picture\" (noting that one could never see the whole picture if you \nare in the frame, so to speak). \nBut I think the so called \"darkness/despair\" that we inevitably find \nourselves walking in throughout different times of our lives is in fact, in \nand of itself, potentially instructive IF we are receptive to it. But of \ncourse even still we must be prepared to endure perhaps long and \nuncomfortable periods of angst, fear, sorrow..etc. that comes with this \nPATH of darkness...whereby all we can do is take it day by day with little \nsense of hope or even complete hopelessness. But their are many rituals or \npractices from various religions or spiritual systems from a variety of \ncultures that can help one through this path of darkness. These traditional \nand often ancient meditative and contemplative rituals/practices can help \none embrace the \"darkness\" which seems at first at unnatural thing because \nmost of us when faced with great grief and suffering will naturally want to \nrun away with from it. Some will partake in various versions of \"escapism\" \nbe it by self-medicating or unhealthy outlets and distractive but \ndestructive behaviors or depend upon western psychotropic  meds like Prozac \nthat also provide a form of denial and escapism ultimately preventing us \nfrom facing & embracing the instruction of the darkness. We try and teach \nour children to face their fears so that they can be stronger yet \nironically we so often in this so called \"modern society\" are unwilling to \ndo it as adults. The ancient mystical traditions teach that we should \"go \ninto the darkness\" .. \"eat the darkness into the pain\" do not run away from \nit...one can not learn the lessons by choosing to run from it.  \nMechtild of Magdeburg,  a well noted thirteenth century woman of the \nBeguine Christian order wrote of this darkness in the following \nmanner...she says: \u201cThere comes a time when both body and soul enter into \nsuch a vast darkness that one loses light and consciousness and knows \nnothing more of God\u2019s intimacy. At such a time when the light in the \nlantern burns out the beauty of the lantern can no longer be seen. With \nlonging and distress we are reminded of our nothingness\u2026.I am hunted, \ncaptured, bound, wounded so terribly that I can never be healed. God has \nwounded be close unto death.\" 15] Mechtild does not run from the darkness \nbut stays and learns. \u201cGod replied: \u2018I wish always to be your physician, \nbringing healing anointment for all your wounds. If it is I who allow you \nto be wounded so badly, do you not believe that I will heal you most \nlovingly in the very same hour?\u201d What is it we learn in this darkness of \nsoul and spirit? \u201cFrom suffering I have learned this: That whoever is sore \nwounded by love will never be made whole unless he embrace the very same \nlove which wounded her.\u201d \n\npeace my friend mattcatt...keep on striving."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR519vC2NEngz5WOEWg3gFA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "matt thecat", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13uetd4nlnzcdr5o04cf3qruvnltjara1g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-11T22:17:32.451Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCR519vC2NEngz5WOEWg3gFA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.086032000000000053, "formal_score": 52, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-11T22:17:32.451Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115278742156915633435", "textDisplay": "I work at a retirement community and see the inevitable downward slide of \nsenior citizens on a daily basis.It's not easy here either.Perspective is \nsomething I can't escape.\n\nOther than that...I am 'up to no good' lol"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_qcp7jLFeOAw-rKRT7iKVg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Keybob Rob", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13uetd4nlnzcdr5o04cf3qruvnltjara1g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-11T09:20:04.678Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_qcp7jLFeOAw-rKRT7iKVg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.47269800000000001, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-11T09:20:04.678Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101186260217764952540", "textDisplay": "+matt thecat I don't quite know what you are talking about but in any \nevent,  how have you been my friend.

Martin Luther King Jr. is a civil rights \nactivist who inspired the grassroots to forget their differences no matter \nwhat political views or affiliation to come to together for a common cause. \nI think you may have lost the point of what he represents by others. Yes, \nhe could be seen be a role moral or even a moral instructor but not from \nthe perspective of his personal life. I see him as being a role model for \nthe oppressed and downtrodden. The accusations made against his personal \nlife are irrelevant.     \nIn my previous paragraph I wrote that he inspired people enough to forget \ntheir differences and rally together. So as a consequence, some of those \ninvolved would be republican, liberal, socialist, communists etc. So I \ndon't understand what you are getting at?  He called himself a social \ndemocrat, isn't that enough? I believe in treating people how you want to \nbe treated, capitalism, and individuals owning their own properties, small \ngovernance and interference in our lives. Martin Luther King Jr. still \ninspires me. I believe in the free market but still believe in helping \nthose in real poverty.\nFor me the ignorant and the compliant in a democratic society is far more \ndangerous than any communist or a national socialist for the reason that \nthe latter two know the importance of their rights and are prepared to go \nout and protest for their rights to air their views. McCarthyism was a \nterrible era which I hope will never be repeated. \nWe are accustomed to a low intellectual and dumbed down education system \nwhich results in a celeb culture that controls individual thought by \ndestroying an undesired message by tarnishing the reputation of the \nmessenger.

In Chicago, white \nracists climbed trees along the street to throw rocks at him. If you want \nto compare the condition of African Americans today with their condition in \nthe 1970s, what about the culture of fear and the virulent racism which was \nso prevalent then? Do you believe that white people were not shamed by \nKing? I remember feeling great shame when I saw what whites were doing to \nblacks at that time.
