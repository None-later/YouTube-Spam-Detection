And it's not about morality but about biology. Every \ntime you sleep with a women there is a chance you create a new child. And \nthere are legit reasons not to want to abort a pregnancy even if you not \nreligious. E.g. the continuation of the human race. We humans have powerful \nemotions about procreation and feeling a life grow inside you is a real \nthing, not just a philosophical question if a man has the right to choose.\n\nBoth had the right to choose if they sleep with each other or not, sex can \nresult in pregnancy and that is simply a biological fact. If you don't want \nto pay child support for your own kid then don't sleep with women you don't \nknow. Biology doesn't care about \"casual sex\". Biology takes each sex act \nvery seriously lol.\n\nAnd also you are moving the goal post. Now we are talking about women that \nget pregnant even though the man used condoms. This is a special case and \ncould be treated as a special case. Still you would also have the option of \nasking the women if she uses the pill.\n\nBoth men and women want to have sex but both have to live with the \nconsequences. The only reason this absolutely irrational emotion exists is \nfor procreation. You can't say the women has to act rationally and abort \nwhile the man can act rationally and sleep with her in the first place.\n\nAnd lastly you can at least see there is a discussion about this. It's not \na black and white issue like Stefan likes to make it. There is no simple or \neasy solution to this.

So no if a man and a woman have \nsex they DID NOT sign a contract to raise a child. The woman has all the \nchioces and in the west these are all lifestyle choices.

The man should have the reproductive right to choose when and with \nwhom he might raise a child. If the woman is determined to be a solo mother \nby choice then she needs to fully fund that lifestyle choice herself. If \nshe can't afford it, don't get pregnant and don't keep the fetus/child. \nIt's a bad choice so if she insists on making that chioce for her own \nreasons she must fund it totally herself. \nIt's very simple once you start to consider women as fully grown adults how \ncan take responsibility for their own lifestyle choices.

Feminists and \nfeminist organisations oppose men having any reproductive rights. \nFor example it may be appropriate that only the woman should sole right to \ndetermine if she wants to keep a featus or not. That would seem reasonable \nto me and I imagine most people. However the biological father should have \na similar right to choose if he should be a father or not. If for example, \nshe wants the baby and he doesn't then he should have the right to opt out \nof fatherhood and all that goes with it. Just like she has. If she wants to \nhave a baby against his wishes, she can't expect him or the government to \npay for her lifestyle choice. Particularly because it is a poor chioce for \nthe child and for society. \nHence men can be granted reproductive rights without removing reproductive \nrights of women. That would be equal rights. However feminists oppose any \nreproductive rights for men because it inevitably means that women have to \npay the consequences of their choices. \nYou are claiming that feminism is about equal rights for both genders. \nHowever the evidence shows us that this claim is untrue. Perhaps you feel \nthat feminism should be about equal rights but that doesn't make it so. I \nthink that after 40 or 50 years of what feminism is in reality is enough \nfor us to draw conclusions. I don\u2019t see that the ideology has changed is \npractices. I just see that most people have identified feminism for what it \nis in practice and hence have abandoned the ideology. \nI think reproductive rights illiterates this quite clearly. It's easy to \nsay that you want equal rights but when men ask for the one right they \ndon't have then suddenly there are a host of reasons or objections that \nfeminists use to oppose it.

She was \nopening up a dialog between men and women but criticizing Emma like Stefan \ndoes in this video isn't going to help the dialog going.\n\nStefan keeps bringing up this study where the total number individual \nincidences of a child getting hit by a middle class American mothers is \nover 900 but less than a 1000.  If this study is correct that means if you \nare a child of a middle class American mother the chances of being hit are \nextremely low because there are millions and millions of middle class \nmothers in America.\n\nMen die younger than women because of genetics.  Men have less genetic \nmaterial than women.  Women are XX chromosomes and men are XY.  For a women \nif something happens to one of the X chromosomes the cell can then go to \nthe other X chromosome as sort of a backup system genetically.  If the X \nchromosome in a male gets damaged the cell may not be able to go to the Y \nchromosome for backup since it does not contain all the genetic information \nas an X chromosome does. \n\nI do agree with Stefan that women play a roll and even perhaps are 50% of \nthe cause of inequality between men and women.  I have often said to my \ngirlfriends that women as a whole do not realize the power they posses. \n That since by in large women are the primary care givers between birth and \nsay 9 or 10 years old that in one generation women could change a society \ncompletely if they just raise their children differently.\n\nI also agree that depending on what state you live in some states heavily \nfavor women and some men in a divorce and child custody issues.  I do agree \nthat generally courts favor child custody to the mother.  This makes sense \nsince mothers overwhelmingly are the primary care givers though it is \nunfair to the stay at home Dad's when it come to divorce.\n\nYes women do physically abuse men.  However since on average men have \nalmost twice as much upper body strength as women when women hit they do \nfar less damage.  Pitbulls are no more likely to bite than any other dog \nbreed.  It is just that they are so much stronger and end up doing so much \nmore damage when they do that they get more publicity.  I am not saying it \nis OK for a woman to hit a man or that there aren't times when a male \nvictim will need as much emotional and financial support as an female \nvictim.

She could have said things \nclearly, had she wanted to. It's not that hard.\n\nAlso, whether these women hate men or not is a non issue, relatively \nspeaking. What's an issue is that they commit hostile actions including \nstealing resources, threatening and subjugating men and women to violence, \nand skewing the work and will of the unawake population to the detriment of \nthe men boys and future generations, including disturbing work in the \ninterest of men. \n\n\"heforshe\" what a joke.\n\nI would discourage any man from caring more than a second about whether \nthese people hate you or not. They are effectively your enemies in action \nand how your enemies feel, whether it be hate, joy, fear, should really be \nquite irrelevant.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13tv5jxmtyuwhmwy04ccbgrel3zybfxynk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYgZNZwsMBZ0zjkGtEFmLlA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "John Doe", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-22T19:09:01.035Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYgZNZwsMBZ0zjkGtEFmLlA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.5864339999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-22T19:11:25.000Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105283339642366183697", "textDisplay": "Another thing Stefan never gets around to bringing up-possibly because of \nhis pacifism-is ending the cycle of violence of wars.

I suspect there is a good \nchance that she *personally* cares about gender equality, but that doesn't \nchange the duplicity of the HeForShe campaign or of feminism more broadly. \nFor example, Emma brought up that men, like women, are restrained by \ncertain gender roles. However, her speech then turned to how freeing men \nfrom these gender roles would benefit women. Acknowledging that freeing men \nof gender roles *for their own sake* would've been nice, but I give her the \nbenefit of the doubt that this was the intended message, albeit a poorly \nphrased one.\n\nMuch less forgivable is the lack of real-world action by feminists toward \nimproving the plight of men and the language used by HeForShe that is \nsimilarly dismissive of men's issues. On the first point, what has feminism \ndone to address the concerns brought up about (for example) bias in custody \ndecisions following divorce? Surely, there are individual feminists who \ncare about and have fought this discrimination against men, but it is not \neven a blip on the radar of the feminist movement at large. In fact, Karen \nDeCrow faced rampant criticism from her own ranks for her support of shared \ncustody during her time as President of the National Organization for Women.\n\nThe same type of hypocrisy is apparent in the HeForShe campaign. It claims \nto be about promoting gender equality, but all of its rhetoric is evidence \nto the contrary. From the HeForShe webpage: \"Gender equality is not only a \nwomen\u2019s issue, it is a human rights issue that requires my participation. I \ncommit to take action against all forms of violence and discrimination *faced \nby women and girls.*\" But this omission of men and boys must've been a \nsimple oversight, right? Not so: \"HeForShe is a solidarity movement for \ngender equality that brings together one half of humanity *in support of \nthe other half of humanity*, for the benefit of all.\" For the benefit of \nall? What a crock of shit! When HeForShe (and feminism) admits that men \nface problems in their own right (rather than as side-effects of problems \nthat women face) *and* actively work to ameliorate these problems, I will \ntake its claim of promoting gender equality seriously.\n\n\nFWIW, I don't consider myself an MRA either.

So much so I can only assume there is some bad history \n& personal issues involved. I am not sure where you acquire most of your \nstatistics, but claiming that children raised on physical discipline are \nmore likely to later in life be violent & aggressive must be wrong. Perhaps \nyou need to separate excessive physical discipline & general physical \ndiscipline.\nDuring my Teenage years where my social circles where at their largest, it \nwas quite clear which of us had received appropriate discipline. I and only \na small number of others during our childhoods might recieve a clip round \nthe ear for slightly stepping out of line when we knew of our actions, or \nreceive a firm smack to the rear for actively breaking rules & even laws. \nIn our teenage years, those of us who had recieved the physical discipline \ngrew up respecting our parents & upholding the laws of society. Whilst the \nmajority of our social circles received no physical discipline to little \ndiscipline at all & they showed no respect to elders or authority. Often \nthey would get in trouble with the police for drugs, alcohol, smoking, \nvandalism, skipping school, fighting, and sexual indecencies. Many of those \ndisobedient teenagers are now adults either in prison or single parents on \ncouncil estates, milking the government for every benefit they can, with \nmultiple children conceived with different partners (a few of which were \nconceived whilst they still attended school). Where as those of us that did \nrecieve the physical discipline as children, respect the law, have stable \nrelationships, care about the welfare of ourselves & those around us, put \neffort into education and careers & generally strive for a higher standard \nof living. I was disciplined physically and I am a pacifist & not \naggressive in the slightest. I am friendly, caring, respectful, \nconsiderate, but sometimes can be a little shy & quiet at times.\nAND YES, like our parents before us, we punish our children accordingly, to \nhow we deem nessasary for the crimes commited.\nA big problem in the UK during the past (almost) decade, were groups of \nyouths referred to as Chavs. Degenerates & Scum that should have been \nbanned from breeding (as parenting is not a word you could possibly \nassociate with a Chav). Lack of physical discipline thanks to the media's \nportrayal of it equaling bad parenting, must be the route cause of what I \ncan only refer to as an Outbreak of these Chavs. Luckily in the last year \nor two, numbers of this plague seem to have dwindled & I can only assume \nthat either users of physical discipline is on the rise again here in the \nUK, or that Chavs are slowly losing the ability to reproduce (we can only \nhope).\nIt's basic common sense, but a child raised with a fear of punishment will \nobviously in adult life be less inclined to commit a crime than a child who \nwas raised without fear of punishment.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13zzvkw1xeqf3amq220cds42wmlgt34004": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYDQ_ZwH6MkSjO9s0oQ-wQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UwMsu5NKY3g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFE/M4Qe7qJpsAg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ChristieRoad", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-09T20:11:35.311Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLYDQ_ZwH6MkSjO9s0oQ-wQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.82285179999999991, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-09T20:11:35.311Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114913369096712020558", "textDisplay": "Where is the statistic of women acutally getting paid better?

So \nmuch of what we hear is not what is being said.   The primary method of \nthis language persuasion is presupposition, which is a statement that \nsounds like one thing is being said, when, in fact, there's an entirely \ndifferent meaning. \n\nAn example.  The question; \"Do you think the minimum wage should be 15 \ndollars an hour? 10 dollars and hour? Or should it remain what it is? \n\nSounds like I'm offering three choices, but in fact, I'm limiting your \nchoices.   I'm removing the choice of, \"there shouldn't be a minimum wage\" \nand directing you to think in terms of there should be a minimum wage.  If \nyou select any of the three options presented, you have indirectly said \nthere should be a minimum wage, and likely never even consciously noticed \nthat the choice was an illusion, and in fact, you were forced into a \nposition to accept the idea that a minimum wage is what's best.\n\nAnother example; \"do you still beat your wife?\"   if you answer that \nquestion, you are admitting that you have or do, beat your wife.\n\nWhen a salesperson says, \"which credit cards would you like to use?\" if you \nanswer VISA, you have agreed that you are buying whatever is being sold.\n\nThese are simple examples, but presuppositions are not always that obvious, \nand they do work to establish a thought.   This speech is loaded with \nexamples of presupposition and other persuasive techniques.\n\nIn fact, this post I'm making now has some presuppositions contained.  I \nsuggest you look for them, and learn how to spot them, because we are under \na constant barrage of mind manipulation through covert language. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z134ubn5xumgydpok04cfn2gkvmrfzriu14": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3_CHgaCxPYtS-jRV-G54Cg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "lamentation2", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-30T00:54:34.682Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3_CHgaCxPYtS-jRV-G54Cg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.73656999999999995, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-30T00:54:34.682Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106462484248213697838", "textDisplay": "She sounds like a nervous 14 year old.

So because a SMALL subset of men cat call \nwomen, every man needs to undergo further \"understanding and respect\" \ntraining? The vast majority of males grow up knowing to respect EVERYONE, \nnot just women. Yet some still cat call. In order to completely stop cat \ncalling, you have to take away freedom of speech, which is a greater wrong \nthan cat call can ever be.\n\n\"But instead of arguing with me (I really don't have the time) can you \nplease just think about what I have said and try to understand OUR point of \nview.\"\n\nYour point of view is based on false statements and a lack of logic.

She didn't do anything to actually solve these issues. It \nwas either a naive stance or a cowardly stance, not tackling the elephants \nin the room and holding feminism accountable for its ugly actions. What an \nempty speech, no action following such will impact the world. Her examples \nof problems are mediocre. At a UN speech/conference, she should have chosen \nkey problems that are massive and affect us globally, or more \ninternationally.\n\nSwedish feminist laws, the limitations of women getting jobs and being \nindependent in middle Eastern countries, the heavy traditional \nresponsibility of the men in those same middle eastern countries, as the \nbreadwinners who, to have a family, socially must take care of their wife \nand kids all on their own, male prison rape- especially in the biggest \nprison nation (America). I think one of the biggest issues women, \nparticularly western women, face is the propaganda-riddled cult of \nprofessional victimhood within feminism. What a mental illness, and it's \nbeing encouraged. It ruins women's lives too, like a drug. The men and \ncommunity around these women gets hurt in the same way the \nrelatives/community of a drug addict get hurt. As the drug of victimhood \nerodes away the person, making them comparably more pathological than \nbefore, they become a burden on society and may even scar their close ones \nfor a life time of therapy. Feminism is a disease hurting everyone. \nBut Emma Watson doesn't tackle any of this. A leader is not a person who \nfollows the status quo, but rejects what is wrong and harmful and supports \nwhat is right and healing. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13xfz05jw2owzxi304ce3aheuu5dxbipgs": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiKXbYAYucbmKYMSv5oL9OQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fUbEKUk6KUg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANA/_2dj8mBzzGk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kate Bystrova", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-07T16:26:49.742Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCiKXbYAYucbmKYMSv5oL9OQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.10927200000000004, "formal_score": 58, "updatedAt": "2014-10-07T16:26:49.742Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107566706541667396648", "textDisplay": "This is full of great points, but I have one main stickler with it: Stefan, \nyou say, rightly, that women are moral agents free to make their own \ndecisions \u2013 women are not at the mercy of men, they choose to be with their \npartners (at least in developed countries, for the most part), they choose \nwhether they hit their children, etc. I am not disagreeing with this at all \n\u2013 it is true, and many women need to realise that these are choices.\n\nYou oppose the speech when it states that women are oppressed as a \nconsequence of men's actions, victims vs abusers.

However, I prefer \nnot to group MGM (male genital mutilation) with FGM (female genital \nmutilation) as they are not the same. Firstly, the two practices are \nperformed for TOTALLY different reasons. The practice of MGM originated to \nprotect men from certain sexual transmitted diseases. It is more socially \nacceptable because it has known health benefits (decreases chance of UTI, \npenile cancer, and sexually transmitted infections), and is performed when \nthe boy is an infant. However, FGM is performed when the girl reaches \npuberty, and is done for a totally different reason. FGM is done to \u201ckeep \ngirls pure\u201d by making sure that sex is totally unenjoyable. It has no known \nhealth benefits, and is even considered a detriment to a girl's physical \nand psychological health. Having the procedure performed against the girls \nconsent is bad enough. Having to deal with trauma and pain during \nurination, childbirth, and intercourse is even worse. And worst of all, FGM \ncauses severe infections, and in a profuse amount of cases, death. \n\n\nI don't mean to be rude or an internet troll or anything; I just sincerely \nfeel strongly about this issue. I disagree with either form of genital \nmutilation, only because it is performed without the consent of the person. \n\n\nAnd I would like to remind everyone that not every single feminist is only \nfighting in the interest of women. I identify as a human fighting for \nthe equal rights of everyone, who also happens to be a feminist (who fights \nfor the rights of women, since I keep equality in mind for everyone)."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaDXKKbD7lRRxUpxbmMEV8Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Syerjchep", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mztxaxl3mdr45m04cfd3azorfez5iz34", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-04T06:59:06.027Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaDXKKbD7lRRxUpxbmMEV8Q"}, "sentiment_score": 0.92769610000000002, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-04T06:59:06.027Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4ZFf1r_hM3k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAk/DDFXkQAbiqw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115732540717043385392", "textDisplay": "+Verena Valkyrie The 25% stat isn't really relevant for first world \ncountries."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOJx0X0ffBzF5bUmdQeGnCQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ecchi Version Of Liquid", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mztxaxl3mdr45m04cfd3azorfez5iz34", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-11T21:53:14.298Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOJx0X0ffBzF5bUmdQeGnCQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.92775820000000009, "formal_score": 13, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-11T21:53:14.298Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9cKJZi4c3j0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAH0/kDUE71HxYFE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117719398672968787998", "textDisplay": "shaming people is kind of boring, i don't get it....just let em be idiots \nand make fun of them, no one needs to believe you or be like you."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0rq4m2ThYzMaRjPa-mwBkA", "inappropriate_score": 2.5316455696202533, "authorDisplayName": "Doctor Turdmidget", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mztxaxl3mdr45m04cfd3azorfez5iz34", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-10T19:31:05.123Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0rq4m2ThYzMaRjPa-mwBkA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.31379000000000001, "formal_score": 24, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-06-10T19:31:05.123Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113325157993081021108", "textDisplay": "+Verena Valkyrie It sounds like you too have had some bad experiences in \nyour childhood and, by your own rationale, are not in a position to start a \nneutral discussion.

True feminists DO believe \nthat male rights are as important as female rights, as Emma outright \nstates. True feminists believe that everyone, men AND women, have a \nresponsibility to change the sexualization and the unequal treatment of \nwomen. You keep referencing situations where women are given more rights \nthan men but provide no in depth concrete examples (except paternity leave \nand child rearing). You keep preaching a wish for equality for men too and \nthen fail to offer examples where equality is not provided. Well I can \ncertainly give you some examples where women are not treated equally. \n\nThe problem is that places where women are seen as \u2018superior\u2019 to men (i.e. \nchild rearing, teaching) are often positions that are devalued or underpaid \nin our society. What is more important: Cleaning a house/child rearing or \ngetting a high paying job? Teaching or politics? Nurses or doctors? The \nanswer is the latter in all of these scenarios \u2013 and the latter are all \npositions predominantly held by men rather than women.  So the positions \nthat are skewed in favour of women are normally lower-level positions.\n\nLet\u2019s use your example of teachers. I know that teachers are predominantly \nwomen \u2013 it\u2019s a fact. You imply that this shows an unequal balance that is \nskewed towards women but when we look at the position of principles and \nvice principals, less than half of them are women. How can this be when \nwomen represent such a large portion of teachers? It\u2019s because women are \nvery often seen as unfit in positions of power. I was told in a job: \u201cYou \nare being considered for management. We almost never promote women because \nthey don\u2019t command respect or authority, but you do.\u201d I wonder how many \ntimes you have been told: \u201cWe almost never promote men. They don\u2019t have the \ncompassion or empathy required to manage employees effectively, but don\u2019t \nworry, you do.\u201d\n\nYou say that women outperform men in schools which points to inequality in \nour educational system. So why women are paid only 77-90 cents for every \ndollar paid by men in the same positions (number varies depending on the \nsource)? If they seem to be doing better in schools, does it not mean they \nhave at least equal value in their chosen career? Is equal pay a \"first \nworld problem\" as some of your supporters have suggested? I personally do \nnot think so. I think that equal pay is a global issue.\n\nYou are confused when Emma said her friends dropped out of sports because \nthey did not feel sexy? I am confused that you are confused! Our society \nconstantly preaches slim beauty and gender roles! Look to headlines of \nSerena and Venus Williams who have received multitudes of negative \nattention for their thicker arms or muscular bodies. They are not body \nbuilding women as you imply. Lean women are the ideal, not STRONG women \n(which is why dance is an athletic activity \u2018suitable\u2019 for women, since it \nproduces such a lean type of strength). Our society shames women with big \nmuscles (ever heard the term \u201cbutch\u201d? Why is there no negative male terms \nfor this?) and does not do this for men (unless the man is unnaturally \nbig). How often are women sexually objectified in the media compared to \nmen? I promise you, it happens substantially more to women. Look at Sarah \nPalin or Hillary Clinton who were actively objectified in the media during \ntheir 2008 elections despite a need for coverage of their political goals \nand ideals.  Why did this not happen to the men running in the campaign? \n\nAnd I am sorry, but a dictionary definition of feminism DOES matter. It \nsays what true feminists believe versus the extreme feminists that you seem \nso focused on. We have created a society afraid to say the word feminism \nbecause of the man-hating that we assume comes with feminism. Emma was \nsaying that man hating has become synonymous with feminism and you are a \nprime example of someone who believes that.  It is why in her speech Emma \nspeaks about allowing men to break free of their societal chains and become \nmore vulnerable... because their equality matters too. She does not imply \nthat women are faultless, she speaks of broad culturally accepted norms for \nboth genders in North America! But she calls on men to help because they \nare half of our population and we NEED them to be liberated. Men represent \nabout 75% of congress. Tell me how the equality of women is supposed to be \nachieved without the support of men? If you have ever read feminist theory \nyou would realize that it does not excuse women and calls on all people \nequally to react to the issue.  Do you not see the irony in saying feminism \n\u201cexcuses females from responsibility\u201d for their own liberation? Feminism \ncalls on women and men for action. If their theory excused women from \nresponsibility then why are feminists predominantly female? \n\nI\u2019m sorry but I stopped watching 9 minutes in because I realized that you \nhave read very little on the subject. Stop spewing facts about feminist \ntheory that have no factual basis (\u201cmen bad, women good\u201d is not part of the \ntheory, despite the entertaining ape-like way you say it). You speak of one \nincident where some crazy \u2018feminist\u2019 women threatened to bomb some \nconference. That\u2019s like saying Muslims are all evil because a few \nextremists become terrorists. Sexism flourishes the way racism does: by \ncharacterizing entire groups of people based on a few. I encourage you to \nbe part of the solution rather than part of the problem. When you meet a \nfeminist who seems to be man-hating, please explain to her why it is not \nokay. Please explain that men and women have equal value and THAT is the \ncore of feminism. Please tell her why she is hurting the cause. And please, \ndon\u2019t paint all feminists with the same brush. You hurt societal \nprogression by doing so.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCYvKKUmSXLEEn5gR5l-Uw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "PolarBear21", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12aelpoom2dyxxu422lsfzhxp33f1wnq", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-08T16:14:22.978Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkCYvKKUmSXLEEn5gR5l-Uw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.68269200000000008, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-08T16:14:22.978Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LYuR2eHWrV4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/i1yIvVUvwTs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110387590851469855876", "textDisplay": "+Nicole Smith\nhttp://barreloforanges.com/2013/03/06/circumcision-is-a-feminist-cause/\nQuote: \"Patriarchy came up with the idea to cut the genitals of baby boys.\"\n\nThat's just sick and typical of feminist nonsense...blaming any problems \nmen have on the Patriarchy (other men).\nIf this is the kind of help we can expect from feminism then men really \ndon't need it."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNcIM3UnmC9UheQ5mI4OYrQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.052493438320209973, "authorDisplayName": "Ninth Symphony", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12aelpoom2dyxxu422lsfzhxp33f1wnq", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-06T01:20:27.806Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNcIM3UnmC9UheQ5mI4OYrQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.30854200000000004, "formal_score": 29, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-06T01:27:10.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101641461440509680036", "textDisplay": "- \" True feminists DO believe that male rights are as important as female \nrights, as Emma outright states.\"\n\nNo true scotsman fallacy.

So why women are paid only 77-90 cents for every \ndollar paid by men in the same positions (number varies depending on the \nsource)?\"\n\nBecause of factors unrelated to education, obviously. Yes, they vary and \nthe studies are inherently flawed as they do not consider every factor that \neffect income, as in that paid by your employer, but rather dismisses some \nto fit their agenda. That's why statistics when associated with social \nstudies, an hilarity of a field in itself, are a laugh.\n\n- \"Lean women are the ideal, not STRONG women (which is why dance is an \nathletic activity \u2018suitable\u2019 for women, since it produces such a lean type \nof strength).

By shame, I'm certain that \nyou mean; 'men don't find muscular women attractive', which is true with \ndeviations allowed obviously. There is a male term; wimp, spas, twig etc. \nWhy? Because females don't find wimps attractive with deviations allowed of \ncourse. It does do this for men. You probably have as well, assuming you're \nheterosexual. What do you find to be more attractive; Channing Tatum's body \nor that of let's Jesse Eisenberg's body type? You probably prefer Tatum's \nwhich isn't surprising nor strange. It's biology. \n\n- \"And I am sorry, but a dictionary definition of feminism DOES matter. It \nsays what true feminists believe versus the extreme feminists that you seem \nso focused on.\" \n\nAh, we make full circle again, yes. Scots must be quite annoyed by this \nterm by now but I love the scotsman fallacy and so do you, apparently. It \ndoesn't matter when the actions contradicts the dictionary definition. \nBecause if it did, then you'd assume that languages and the meaning of \ncertain words therein, are fixed. They are not.\n\n- \"Emma was saying that man hating has become synonymous with feminism and \nyou are a prime example of someone who believes that. \"\n\nAs do many others, seeing as it as become synonymous with feminism. While I \nmyself am a strong believer in mass ignorance, I don't believe that holds \ntrue in this case. \n\n- \"It is why in her speech Emma speaks about allowing men to break free of \ntheir societal chains and become more vulnerable\"\n\n1. You assume that men want this because you proclaim that they do.\n2. You assume that they aren't free to be as vulnerable as they want, \nnothing hinders them.  \n3. Who is in a position to ALLOW individuals to be who they are?\n4. Why is that a desirable trait?\n\n- \"But she calls on men to help because they are half of our population and \nwe NEED them to be liberated.\"\n \nSince we established that feminism has become synonymous with man-hating \nand that many believe that this is true, including myself, do you find it \nsurprising that men may be reluctant to aid FEMINISTS in THEIR quest for \nliberation? It's like aiding something that wants to destroy you. \n\n- \"Stop spewing facts about feminist theory that have no factual basis \n(\u201cmen bad, women good\u201d is not part of the theory, despite the entertaining \nape-like way you say it).\" \n\nAgain, the theory isn't interesting. The application is. The result of the \napplication is plainly visible. \n\n- \"That\u2019s like saying Muslims are all evil because a few extremists become \nterrorists.\" \n\nEvil doesn't exist. However, all muslims are idiots because they're \nreligious. As are ALL christians, jews etc. you name it. The extremists are \njust the ones willing to announce it to the rest of us. \n\n\n- \"Sexism flourishes the way racism does: by characterizing entire groups \nof people based on a few.\"\n\nSo..... feminism in a nutshell? \n\n- \"When you meet a feminist who seems to be man-hating, please explain to \nher why it is not okay.\"\n\nI will not, I will ridicule her to no ends. If that individual retorts to \nviolence, Darwin will guide the way. \n\n- \"Please explain that men and women have equal value and THAT is the core \nof feminism. Please tell her why she is hurting the cause.\"\n\nSpreading lies is what inherently dogmatic people do, I don't. \n\n- \"And please, don\u2019t paint all feminists with the same brush. You hurt \nsocietal progression by doing so.\"\n\nYou are already painted with same colour as religious people are, in my \nbook, the colour of stay-the-fuck-away-from-and-treat-as-hostile. No, \nsocial progression can't be stopped or hurt, surely social studies \nadvocators know this. \n\nIf you read this, have a nice day or don't. Either which suits me \nbrilliantly.

It is extremists who are the problem, just as extremists in \nthe anti-feminist movement are a problem. And I'm very glad that you know \nother feminists who share my viewpoint because, like I said, we are the \nmajority.\n\nAgain, please source your information - not sure where you are getting \ninformation on the lack of pay gap? And the way the equal pay law is \nwritten (as I understand it), you have to prove that you are being paid \nless because you are a woman for the law to apply. However, oftentimes this \nis very difficult to prove. For example, look at the study I spoke of \nearlier. When given two identical resumes professors at Yale chose a resume \nwith the name John over a resume with the name Jennifer. They also offered \nto pay the \"man\" John an extra $4,000. These employers were men *and women* \nin higher education who believe in equality of the sexes. But our \npsychological biases are deeply ingrained and so sexism manifests subtly in \nthe pay and hiring structure. The point is that it is difficult to prove \nsuch subtle actions are caused by gender (because often the perpetrators \ndon't even realize it themselves)... but like this study shows, these \nthings happen and often go unnoticed. Logic isn't always a factor in human \npsychology. You'll find racism still operates in the same implicit way. \n\nI'm still not sure why you are talking about radical responses. The only \nradical feminist responses I've heard are from men on this discussion \nboard. Asking questions is CRITICAL, no one should ever compare you to \nHitler for doing so. If a feminist says this to you, feel free to contact \nme and I will put her in her place. \n\n\"This is how feminists I see on tv, in schools and in politics work these \nare the feminists that are recruiting nationwide.\" Don't you realize how \nskewed our media is? I don't think it's right to drop the term feminism \nthat has done so much good for women, men, and children in the world \nbecause the media portrays it negatively. \n\nBesides, if feminism IS broken then it is up to us to fix it. That is why \nhaving men involved in feminism is so critical. We shouldn't abandon a \nmovement that has TRADITIONALLY been a force for equality and morality. \nPutting a new face on old issues (i.e. calling ourselves egalitarian and \nstriving for similar goals of equality) will elicit the same negative \nresponses in 10 years that feminism receives now. It isn't the name that's \nthe problem, it's the extremists. Until we address them, they will \ninfiltrate egalitarianism as readily as they will infiltrate feminism.

Boren). This \nwas in direct response to laws in Oklahoma that made it legal for an 18 \nyear old female to drink but made the legal age 21 for men. This implied \nthat men are more reckless \u2013 a regular gender stereotype that Justice Ruth \nBader Ginsburg \u2013 a feminist \u2013 struck down as unconstitutional.\n\n2) Feminism has also advocated for single men. Moitz v. Commissioner \nchallenged the fact that not all men could request dependent care \ndeductions. Tax deductions were given to women, widowers, and divorced men, \nsingle males slipped through the cracks at that time. Ending this \ndiscretionary policy was soley in favour of single men.\n\n3) Feminists wrote to the FBI to change the definition of \u201crape\u201d to include \nmen who are raped. Until pretty recently in US history, the old definition \nwas \u201ccarnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will\u201d which \nexcluded males from being raped. Feminists acknowledged that men can be \nvictims too. Their efforts RIGHT NOW to eradicate sexual assault in the \nmilitary actually helps more males than females, since males are the \nvictims in the majority of rape cases during the wars overseas.  Along the \nsame lines, the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, led by feminist Lovisa \nStannow, advocated for the 200,000 inmates who are sexually abused, most of \nwhom are men.\n.\n4) Most recently in 2013 the U.S. department of defense decided to allow \nwomen in combat roles. The feminist Charles Clymer explained that the \nmilitary opened up 237,000 jobs that were previously off-limits to females. \nThe draft is next. Besides, studies have shown that mixed gender units \ndemonstrate smarter thinking and why should males be forced to endure that \nburden alone?\n\n5) Thanks to feminist activism, paternity leave exists.Because contrary to \nwhat some of you believe, feminists strive for equal *two parent* homes. A \nMom or Dad can stay at home. It's their choice. \n\nTo read a more thorough list (because there are definitely more than 5 \nthings feminists have done for men), please feel free to visit: \nhttp://mic.com/articles/88277/23-ways-feminism-has-made-the-world-a-better-place-for-men\n\nWhat this entire group has been doing is selective bias. You are choosing \nthe handful of incidents where feminism has not been perfect in its goal. \nThe BEST way to change this is to become active in the movement or at the \nvery least to bring to issues to the attention of advocate groups. When you \nlogically and articulately explain what has been unequal then change can \nhappen.

First off, \nI never denied that some feminists have made poor decisions. I said that \ntaking a few cases and misapplying them to a whole population of people is \nwrong and diminishes the very important cause they fight for. And I said \n\u201ctrue feminists\u201d believe in equality because a true feminist believes in \nthe dictionary definition of feminism as cited by Stefan himself. That is \nwhat dictionary definitions are for: appropriately classifying. \n\nInstead, I have been challenging the inductive fallacies and biases of this \ndiscussion such as hasty generalizations about feminists. I am a feminist \nand I am telling you that I don\u2019t believe what you say feminists believe. \nChoosing to ignore this is an example of slothful induction (dismissing it \nas a coincidence). This forum has also been exceptionally good at special \npleading: paying attention to relevant statistics that support your cause \nand ignoring the information I\u2019ve provided which refutes your points. For \nexample, citing something as an exception to a widely accepted principle \nwithout justifying why it is more valid (in the case of the argument \u201cthe \nwage gap doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d when most academics agree that it does).\n\nAnd I\u2019ve said this many times but I will repeat it for your sake: my post \nwas in response to anti-feminist comments, not pro-male comments. You are \nmaking this man versus woman again and I don\u2019t understand why you believe \nthe two are so opposed. \n\nNo, I don\u2019t work the phones for any laws that are passed. I go through my \nlife and try to change inequality I see on a day-to-day basis. I\u2019ve \npresented at a conference for women in science and engineering, I have \nstood up for women\u2019s rights in the workplace when my male coworkers were \nsexualizing my female coworkers.  I posted here to try to convince \nanti-feminists that feminism is about equality, not about some crazy \nextremists that place women above men. No, I did not get a degree in \nwomen\u2019s studies. Yes, I do have a degree in human psychology and an \nunderstanding of teaching philosophy, sociology, and human rights issues.   \n\nAnd I used arguments for slavery because they are the same arguments that \nare being used in this discussion. No, women do not have it as bad as \nslaves. I was saying that those who oppose human rights often recycle the \nsame poor and unjustified arguments. \n\nI have never said that women are blameless.  What I said is that men and \nwomen are equal. Just as there are evil men, so there are evil women. The \ncrimes of women are equally bad as the crimes of men. Women who assault men \nshould be punished the same as men who assault women. Women who rape men \nshould be punished the same as men who assault women. Feminism is about \nequality in all things. \n\nI don\u2019t think you have a firm understanding of divorce law. If a woman \nmakes more money than a man than the man walks away with HER money. The \nlaws are in place for an important reason. If a man and woman build a life \ntogether, she cleans the house and raises the children and he decides to \nleave and gives her NO money, then she is screwed. It is an unequal power \ndistribution and creates a situation where women are afraid to leave just \nbecause of financial obligation. Women (or men in the same situation) would \nbe more likely to stay in abusive relationships.  Divorce law ensures that \nthe women/men will have SOME financial income while he/she finds a career \nand becomes stable in their new life apart. Is our system slanted towards \nfemales? Absolutely. Is that wrong? Absolutely.\n \nWhy is it that we need to value Gloria Steinem any less than Frederick \nDouglass? Both have contributed to human rights. Both are to be commended \nfor their progressive minds and their passion for what is moral and fair. \n\nAnd of COURSE men created all of those things: because women weren\u2019t \nallowed to contribute. Now that women are playing a larger role in our \nsociety they too help develop a better civilization. Why exclude half of \nyour work force from helping to advance society? And then you blame women \nfor not contributing to civilization? How can women contribute if we are \nexcluded from contributing?  That is a nonsensical argument. \n\nNo one is blaming men for the world\u2019s ills. Feminists blame all of society: \nfemales and males alike. As I\u2019ve said many times, this movement isn\u2019t a \nmovement to bash men. It\u2019s a movement to create worldwide equality. I don\u2019t \nknow why you and all of your fellow anti-feminists keep assuming feminism \nis synonymous with man hating. I bet you don\u2019t personally know a single \nfeminist! \n\nI also think its offensive to generalize your opinion to all men. The men \nin my life all support feminism and equality. Check out Emma Watson\u2019s \ntwitter account and look at all of the men who support the feminist \nmovement. Men are not sick and tired, they are becoming enlightened to the \nissues women are facing. \n\nAnd your question is totally irrelevant. There have been no studies \ncomparing women research volunteers to men research volunteers that I\u2019ve \nseen. Science doesn\u2019t work that way. Some studies require men only, some \nrequire women only. Psychological experiments that I\u2019ve read usually \ncontain equal numbers of males and females. That\u2019s the point of a \nscientific study \u2013 that they be unbiased towards either sex.   \n\nHow many male teams wear pink to support breast cancer? If you believe that \nfeminism should fight for prostate cancer research, why don\u2019t you suggest \nit to some feminists?  I don\u2019t believe they would oppose you.\n\nI do think that women should be drafted if men are drafted. I also know \nthat many women feel the same way. \n\nAgain, I am sick of being labeled as sexist, or snot-nosed, or simplistic, \nor solipsist. Those accusations are irrelevant to our discussion. Attacks \non personal character do not advance your point they simply make you seem \ndesperate. Besides, Obi-wan is awesome!\n\nWomen and men ARE complimentary. Women and men ARE equal.  And those \nsayings may be overused, but it makes them no less valuable. Is the saying: \n\u201ctreat your neighbor as you would like to be treated\u201d any less valuable \nbecause of its consistent use?\n\nAnd umm social movements are not the same as government? They are often \ndiametrically opposed lol. Belittling my belief and comparing it to \npreviously falsified beliefs does not make you right. \n\nMAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!\n- Obi-Wan Kenicoley"}}]}, "z13aj5mgqluewhmdo23vvxzxeyildnjp404": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw6HSz4s9uoMikcJ5Cm6aKw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "dntwantgglplus", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-14T23:04:00.727Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCw6HSz4s9uoMikcJ5Cm6aKw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.14210199999999995, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-12-14T23:04:00.727Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110701791629127653948", "textDisplay": "i think you have to judge a group based on its foundational texts, \notherwise it becomes difficult to debate specific tenants\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12kynwghsaxhfn4j04chxtiml2wjhaobhc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 14, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHIi-NgxK2dwSpACQKPG8A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "morgainnejade", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-16T13:49:19.055Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoHIi-NgxK2dwSpACQKPG8A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.29756999999999995, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2015-08-16T13:49:19.055Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104024534752122605054", "textDisplay": "At just shy of the 8 minute mark, you speak of \"women pretending they have \nnothing to do with the cycle of oppression\" - *SERIOUSLY*!!!??!!!

Citing one, or even a handful, of instances in \nwhich men are treated more harshly than women does not negate the fact that \nwomen had to fight men for basic rights, such as voting. What evidence do \nyou have that supports your claim that man hating is a core concept of \nfeminism and not a fringe activity, if by definition it seeks equality for \nthe two genders? I will reiterate: the extremist feminists get the most \nattention in media just as extremists of any other group do--besides, \nperhaps, Christianity. \n\nIf you look into the wage gap reality more closely, you will see that only \nabout 60% of the wage gap between men and women can be explained by factors \nsuch as occupation, industry, experience, etc [1]. This shows that women \nmake 10% less than men when many factors are controlled for. Your \nevaluation also ignores the fact that women are often not considered for \npositions or promotions because they are women, which then affects their \nearned wages. Considering women in the US have only been able vote within \nthe last century and that it was taboo for women to work after marriage \nuntil well after the world wars, you need to show greater evidence that \nfeminism is man hating and that women are privileged over men socially, \npolitically and economically. \n\nOne additional point: when you look at the affects of war on oppressed \npeoples, you can see that the oppressed individuals benefit from the white, \nmale engagement in war. One example is South America, which flourished \nwhile the United States was distracted by its wars and once again fell to \nturmoil when the attention of the US returned to the south. The same can be \nsaid for women, who were able to get jobs uncharacteristic for women while \nmany men were absent due to war. Productivity during these times were \nhigher, and women faced greater occupational freedom with the notably \ndecrease of men in the labor force. Women lost their jobs when men returned \nfrom war, which women were generally not allowed to participate in, and the \nmen were paid higher for the same positions in which they were replacing \nwomen. This is a history that attests to the white, male privilege \nspecifically, but to the male privilege more generally as well.\n\nYour argument is based on fear-mongering and generally lacks any merit. \nAlso, in response to your comment on the prison gap: men made the laws that \nimprison men more frequently. At no time in history did women establish law \nthat discriminates against men. \n\n1. \nhttps://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/key_issues/gender_research.pdf"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRMb4LKaJg7DdHOR5x8oSYA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "InternetStudiesGuy", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134jhiaykr0c5kzv04ccniakrbryxyohso0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-16T06:03:24.562Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRMb4LKaJg7DdHOR5x8oSYA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.30207999999999996, "formal_score": 64, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-16T06:03:24.562Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SztOl830mXY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACM/wCGj2UAZWa0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109801862884809776583", "textDisplay": "+Chad Langford You may want to look into the wage gap myth a bit more. \nWomen don't earn 75% for the \"same work\".

Feminism is (as Emma Watson points out in her speech) by \ndefinition the equal treatment of men and women. There are some radical \nfeminist organizations and individuals that get the most attention because \nthey unquestionably hate men. This, however, is not representative of \nfeminism in general. The HeForShe movement is intended to mobilize men in \nthe fight for women's equality, and with good reason. The media focus of \nfeminist extremists has badly damaged the larger feminist movement. \nHeForShe is a rebranding effort in order to show that the larger feminist \nmovement is not man-hating, and does not want to put women before men--it \nis merely that women should be treated equally. If women are treated \nequally, then that necessarily means that men would not be at a \ndisadvantage to women--they would be equals. \n\nYes, there are already certain institutions, such as the justice system, \nthat favors women. These unique instances of prejudice against men are \nactually great reasons to support feminism. This is why: if women were seen \nas being social, political and economic equals to men, then institutions \nsuch as the justice system would not have to unfairly punish men for the \nbenefit of women. This prejudice against men is actually a result of female \ninequality, since men are often seen as the provider due to the current \ngender inequality climate. \n\n\nIf I may simplify it further: right now in the US women generally make \n$0.75 (give or take a few pennies) for each $1 earned by men, for the same \nwork. With this situation men are also unfairly punished more often in the \ncourts, and particularly during divorces. If we were able to achieve gender \nequality and women earned equal pay for equal work, then there would be no \nreason for a court to favor women in instances of divorce and unfairly \npunish men. The reason men are unfairly punished in these instances \ncurrently is that women's inequality is so ingrained in our society that \nthe courts feel as though they must protect women from losing their \nprovider. If we stop the trend of men acting as providers for women by \nensuring equal treatment of men and women, then the instances in which \nwomen currently have an unfair advantage will disappear."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgDRq4D-yZHAc_sG6fNmSZQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "limptastic genesis", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134jhiaykr0c5kzv04ccniakrbryxyohso0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-11T22:46:45.315Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgDRq4D-yZHAc_sG6fNmSZQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99972960899999996, "formal_score": 50, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-11T22:46:45.315Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106383046163319093623", "textDisplay": "haha"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRMb4LKaJg7DdHOR5x8oSYA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "InternetStudiesGuy", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134jhiaykr0c5kzv04ccniakrbryxyohso0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-11T06:15:29.118Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRMb4LKaJg7DdHOR5x8oSYA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.62607799999999991, "formal_score": 72, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-11T06:15:29.118Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SztOl830mXY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACM/wCGj2UAZWa0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109801862884809776583", "textDisplay": "+limptastic genesis You sound like a moron to me.

And, by that, I mean it is likely soon to be \na viable public view that masculinity is a bad thing. If you challenge it, \nyour challenge will be regarded as evidence of your masculinity and hence \nyour evil.  All the same sort of BS rhetorical strategies that are used to \nlabel non-progressive/non-leftist ideas and people as racist, misogynist, \nhomophobic, etc., will be applied here. They'll try to confuse the issue by \nidentifying masculinity as machismo (which is not always bad and has its \nplace, honestly), or just outright violence and aggression.  I think the \nfeminists might succeed at this, because I see fewer and fewer men with a \nhealthy sense of masculinity.  I see more and more \"millennials\" who are so \nconfused and indoctrinated and so without any principles that they'll just \nbow down like the beta males they are under the pressure. In the vain hope \nof actually contributing to the defense of masculinity, I offer this as \nfood for thought. This is my view of masculinity.\n\nMasculinity is the complex of character traits and psychological \ndispositions that result in a man (or any human being) who can effectively \npursue the goals, aims, or life in general, that he has judged is best, or \ngood, or right, preferably with controlled and disciplined emotions and \nfeelings that assist him in his pursuit, but also even where his emotions \nand feelings are contrary to his judgments about what is best, or good, or \nright to do.\n\nThis view might be summed up more informally as follows. \"Shut the fuck up, \nstop whining, and get the job done.\"\n\nMasculinity is the opposite of the womanish psychology, whether found in a \nwoman or a man, whereby one's feelings and emotions are sovereign, \nindulged, and used to gauge or judge social intercourse, personal \nwell-being, and even reality on whole.\n\nThe idea that is popping up more and more, as in this speech by Emma \nWatson, that men, being men, being masculine, are bereft of emotions and \nhence defective, is inane and stupidly evil shit. Tied to my view of \nmasculinity is a rich theory of the emotions, as articulated (with some \nvariations) by Plato, Aristotle, and others, according to which, the best \npsychhology to have is one in which your emotions and feelings, in general \nyour affective states of consciousness, support or assist your judgments of \nreason about what it is good or right for you to do. Suppose you judge that \nit's an important career aim to achieve X. You want to feel resolution and \ndetermination. That will assist you in achieving X. You do not want to feel \nfear or timidity pursuing X. That will undermine your ability to achieve \nX.  When you achieve X, you want to feel pride. That emotion will assist \nyou in future achievement. You want to feel anger when you've been wronged. \nIt will assist you to correct the wrong or avoid it, as you have judged it \nis a bad thing. You want to feel care and tenderness for children. It will \nmake you a better father, which you have judged it is good for you to be.\n\nWhen your emotions are subordinated to your judgments of reason, supposing \nyou make reasonably healthy and sound judgments, you will be a more \neffective human being, whether you are male or female. When your emotions \nare out of control and contrary to your judgments of reason, you will be a \nless effective human being and a far more unhappy human being.\n\nThat's the ideal. Few will achieve the ideal. As Aristotle has pointed out, \nreally, this ideal harmony between the emotions and reason must be \nestablished, nurtured, and trained from the time you are child. You really \ndo need to be trained to have a full set of proper emotional responses \nappropriate to the various circumstances you will find yourself in. For the \nrest of us, we must learn to deal with discordant emotions that undermine \nour judgments of reason about what is best to do.\n\nThat's where being a fucking man is most important. In these cases you must \nset aside your discordant, unhelpful, and undermining emotions; you must \njust say to yourself, essentially,\"fuck my emotions, fuck my feelings, it's \ntime to be a fucking man and get the job done. Period.\" Being able to \nrespond to discordant, unhelpful emotions, so far from being evidence of a \nlack of emotions is evidence of having lots of bad, unhelpful, undermining \nemotions. Being a man, in this case, is just controlling them so they don't \nundermine the pursuit of one's goals and aims.\n\nA lot of women are afraid of this. A lot of women, mostly feminists I \nimagine, want to hold on to their loose, extravagant, chaotic emotional \nlives and yet still obtain the benefits of being a disciplined, controlled \nhuman being. How will they manage that? By restructuring social and \npolitical institutions in such a way that the behavior that comes from this \nirrational emotional life is not penalized, and even where possible, it is \npraised and rewarded. The sort of success and achievement that comes from \nself-control and discipline and inner psychological harmony will be \nundermined and devalued in the grand scheme of the \"distribution of social \ngoods\". We are already seeing that transformation now.\n\nThe irony of ironies here is that it's the \"patriarchical\" societies of the \nWest that allowed them to live the sort of lives in which they could \nindulge their emotions and feelings so freely and rarely with serious \nconsequence.  They'd never get away with that shit in a true matriarchy, \nwhere women would have to take up serious responsibilities or else the \nsociety would fold or be destroyed. Yet, today, these feminists not only \nwant to hold on to their patriarchical heritage, but they want to scream, \nscratch, and claw for the benefits of being a self-controlled, disciplined \nman in a patriarchy. \n\nYou fat, lazy Gen Xers and you beta male Millennials better get your shit \ntogether.  The least we can do is keep track of public feminists like Emma \nWatson and reply to them with cool, dispassionate reason every time they \nopen their mouths in public.

I have even \nwatched your other videos recently, which pertain to the argument and \nrather enjoyed them. Second, I have not, until very recently considered \nmyself to maintain feminist ideals. I myself was a victim of the slander of \nextremists. I have always been supportive of human rights however. \n\nThe faults I found with your speech are in part to do with your argument on \nspanking actually.  I disagree with the foundation of your argument in \nessence putting world violence on mothers, as well as emphasizing that a \nwoman\u2019s fight should instead be in the home with herself and other mothers \nas oppose to striving to better human rights devoid of gender. You are \nmaking an assumption that all feminists are mothers, and that is just \nuntrue.\n\nNow, I do not mean this as an \u201canti-man\u201d argument from a feminist, as I see \na number of comments are. In fact I am a large believer, as you emphasize, \nthat there are inequalities on both sides concerning rights. However, I do \nmean this to open your eyes to the gender bias you yourself have stated in \nthis argument, which work against both arguments you were trying to make, \nfrom what I understood. \n\nTo start, the argument of women looking inward, and resolving bias within \nourselves etc. \n\nI am not going to argue with the fact that women perpetuate gender bias. I \nam not going to argue that women socialize men to be within the stereotype \nheld by society. I am not going to argue that women often disregard male \nrights issues in favor of their own. Now, in stating this, I also do not \nfind it difficult to see why that is. The first most feminist movement \ninvolved women legitimately fighting males for the right to be seen as an \nactual person. A person. To which the male population forcefully opposed. \nFrom this point onwards it is easy to see how subsequent generations may \nhave held onto some hostility. That being said, current generations do not \nknow what is was to not be a person and therefore have based their feminist \narguments on other issues and have made significant strides for females \nalone in western society. This is evident in job and pay equality as you \nmentioned. The majority of women now in western society do not identify as \nfeminists. This is because in western society we live in fairly equal \ncircumstances comparatively to other countries and history.  Most women \nbelieve that feminism has in fact achieved what it was mean to achieve. \nThat is until said non-feminists enter the time of motherhood, which I will \nfurther comment on later. \nI struggle to find an appropriate argument to start with, as your comment \nthat women should look internally and in essence only be fighting childhood \nviolence as opposed to human rights issues baffles me. As I have said \nbefore, western society is closer to an ideal, but it is by no means an \nactual ideal now. That alone is basis for activism. You yourself mentioned \n10 male human rights issues which you feel\u2026Im not sure, but I believe that \nwomen should better understand. I think I will try to pose a question \ninstead of try to explain my reaction to this notion. \n\nIf men alone want to see social change for themselves, how then do they do \nthat without the help of half of society? \n\nThe same is said for women. Female feminists have, as you mentioned, spent \ndecades fighting solely female issues successfully. We have more sexual \nfreedom, we have the vote, we are literally seen as people now through the \nworks of feminism. That being said, I am referring specifically to western \nsociety with these notions. As this is a UN proposition, I feel that it \nneeds to be mentioned that many countries have not received any strides in \nthe rights of females to even come close to realizing the current western \nstandard. However, there are still western social limitations that bind \nwomen, much as you explained similarly bind men as well. \n\nSo, I will ask another question. How shall any person, male or female, make \nsocial change, if they are only supported by half of society? \n\nI find it interesting how closely you incorporate parenting into this \nargument, and I do agree with you on some points. For example, women, as \nmothers, do have a hand in socializing men as boys. I believe that is an \nimportant point moving forward. However, you have forgotten to realize the \nway by which current parenting models came to be. Much as males have \n(problematically in ways) always been held in the public sphere of society, \nso too have women been held in the private sphere. We can trace our current \nintensive parenting model (where in by women are in essence the primary \ncaregiver, as only she is capable) to the end of WW2. It in fact was \nliterally men who informed women that if we did not leave work and stay \nhome with our children they will turn into criminals and it will be the \nmother\u2019s fault. (Much like your argument for maternal corporal punishment) \nI say literally as Rousseau does in fact state that in his book Emile, from \nwhich stemmed modern parenting. It is through this model that men became, I \nwould argue, much less than secondary parents, which is a fact that you are \narguing is problematic. I agree. I agree for reasons on behalf of men, and \non behalf of women. However, I also recognize that until societal ideals \nchange to reflect a change in practice, said practices will not change. \n\nMy point is, that it was a male ideal that bread a parenting model, which \noppresses women physically, and men psychologically and socially. It is not \ntrue that men are incompetent parents, just as it is not true that every \nwoman would be an ideal mother. They are social ideologies that need both \nsexes in order to change either. Much like spanking is a social practice. \nInterestingly, if you look to much of the internet fight in support of \nspanking, it is coming from the male population. Even more specifically, it \nis being held to religious standard\u2026.God, the father, apparently taught us \nto spank our children. (another argument for another time) \n\nI also noticed that all of your arguments focused on western ideals. That \nit is problematic as this is a UN proposition. You are not taking into \naccount the varying rights issues held by men anywhere but (I am assuming) \nthe United States. I assume as you mention conscription and here in Canada \nmilitary involvement is not promoted or enforced. The fact of the matter \nis, in many parts of the world, women are treated I would argue, like \nanimals. I will not go into detail, as I am sure you are well aware, but I \nalso believe that any country (both sexes) should help those who are \novertly oppressed and brutalized.  I should hope that men would feel the \nsame as women in this matter as it is similar to involvement of military \naction; it is often in support of those being in more need of it\u2026I hope.\n\nNow, I did notice some overtly stereotypical and demeaning comments as \nwell, regardless of whether they were intended or not. \u201cwomen are suppose \nto be good listeners \u2013 might be time to take that for a spin\u201d, I believe \nwas uncalled for, and rude. ( I will not mention your terrible comments \nwhere mothers are concerned) \n\n\u201cShe appeals to chivalry in he for she, and asks men to man up and be the \nproviders and protectors of women, which is exactly what men don\u2019t want \nanymore\u201d I do not agree. As I brought up before, social change cannot be \nmade without the involvement of society as a whole. I believe this is also \nwhat the founders of He for She understand. That being said, what is being \nasked of men is not to stand on the front lines and carry women into social \nfreedom. We are not asking men to fight the battle while we stand idly in \nthe background. That is a gross assumption, although it is a common \nnarrative in male commentary on this topic. What is being asked is simple, \nto stand beside women as an equal member of society. (similarly to you \narguing men want equity parenting) Just as you explained she did not \nresearch, or think about male wants and needs, so too are you arguing men \nshould not do for women. If neither half of society is willing to \nparticipate or entertain the ideals of the other then how will either \ngender ever hope to change social ideals? Women know how to create social \nchance on their own, that is proven throughout western history. However, as \nyou said, men must be considered. As I said, as men are half of the society \nwe are wishing to change. (Although its interesting how males associate \nsocial activism with a call to war)\n\nI understand your point of her not researching male rights issues, however, \nit must be remembered that this is after all a move towards mainly female \ndeals of equality. That is not to say that men\u2019s ideals are not as \nimportant, it is to say that this is what UN Women are choosing to promote. \nAs you said yourself, there are male conferences, and there should be male \ncounterparts to discussions and movements of male change based on male \nideals, however, if no male is going to actually do so, then that point is \nnull and void. Just because the majority of the action from this movement \nwould be in the benefit of women, and hopefully in majority world \ncountries, does not make it a bad one. It is an important humanitarian \nmovement that should take place, and with the commentary it had received, \nit is clear to see that many do not agree. This confuses me as I do not \nunderstand how people can hear about, and see someone wanting to make any \nkind of positive global change, and be reprimanded for it. It seems \ninhumane to me. \n\nSo, we stand in a space where one movement has been proposed, and will need \nall of society, global society, in order to change. However, more than half \nof society is refusing to even consider it as it is tied into a \nhistorically hurtful ideal. Feminism is responsible for extremist ideals, \nHence male and female reservations when hearing the word. The name in \nitself presents a gendered binary that is obviously in favor of one sex. \nHowever Watson stated this. She said, they are searching for a uniting \nword.  But frankly, despite its negative connotations, feminism I believe, \nsuits this cause perfectly. It is primarily in favor of helping to \nestablish basic female rights in most countries, in hopes of reaching \ngender equality. I believe that if she, in UN Women, were to have used the \nwords Gender equality instead, would have received much more criticism in \nthe form that you are providing her with. (but what about men\u2019s rights?) \nAgain, the name, is a name, and the movement is nothing but positive. \nTherefore this distain for it is entirely unwarranted. Did anyone truly \nexpect any one movement to conquer every human right issue? I don\u2019t believe \nthat is possible. I believe small battles should be fought and won, and \nmore should begin. \n\nHe for She, yes, does literally state that a male is doing something for a \nfemale. It can also be seen that, having the primary position in a title, \nthe man has obviously more respect than the woman in the title. For, mean \nin support of. Not to carry, not to fight for, not to do what she cannot. \nIt means that He is supporting she, literally, in her humanitarian efforts, \nand that is not a bad thing. She is not admitting defeat to men; she is not \nadmitting inability, when she has proven both already. It is a sign of \nrespect in my opinion, to be held prominently in the title. An effort is \nbeing made to be inviting and being rebuffed on grounds of not being \nrespected or invited previously.  But if the only faults you can find in \nthe entirety of the proposition are the name, the negative connotation to \nfeminism, and a lack of research beyond her male friends. I still do not \nsee why you would not support a cause you clearly have no issues with, as \nyou have not argued any of its core values or in what it is trying to \nachieve. \n\n \nI apologize for the length of this rant, I was tired of seeing such \nterrible male and female comments on such a positive proposition and I \ngenerally truly enjoy your video's. I was let down by this one. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12xj5cq1za2jjyvc23pht0ahnjlyluml": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 8, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdfi-dCLmtkPBQYLbBSSkPA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yEFOuzKlU2o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAVsA/1jw1lQ-hMu0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "matt vovakiss", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T11:06:07.113Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdfi-dCLmtkPBQYLbBSSkPA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.75020799999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T11:06:07.113Z", "likeCount": 12, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105477439290010494326", "textDisplay": "Emma Watson\u2019s UN Speech: What She Didn\u2019t Say  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23heforshe\">#heforshe</a> \u00a0"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdfi-dCLmtkPBQYLbBSSkPA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "matt vovakiss", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xj5cq1za2jjyvc23pht0ahnjlyluml", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T19:33:03.046Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdfi-dCLmtkPBQYLbBSSkPA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.49912200000000001, "formal_score": 8, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-01T06:43:28.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yEFOuzKlU2o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAVsA/1jw1lQ-hMu0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105477439290010494326", "textDisplay": "+goatstaog\n outsiders visiting, tend to say that the locals here are strange and not \nvery friendly.

I realize that I haven't lived through that, \nluckily, but just IMAGINE that you are. How horrible would it be? Women are \nstill being stoned in some countries and thats not the worst of it. Of \ncourse horrible things happen to men and I am all for stopping that as \nwell. But right now women are at a worse so lets focus a little more on \ngetting girls to school. But I vote lets ALSO fight for our men, because, \nyes, I know, there are men who get raped, abused and all those horrible \nthings. But at least men can walk the streets at night without being \nscared. At least they don't get humiliated for what they wear. An example \nfrom a modern society: dress codes in school where girls have to wear long \nshorts because short shorts are deemed a distraction. I was once called a \nprostitute in school, by my teacher, in front of my whole class full of \nboys and girls alike. And that is so far from reality. I am a dedicated \nworker, I get good grades, I enjoy learning in school. Guess what? It was \nHOT outside that day. It was the start of summer and I wore shorts 2 inches \nshorter than the rules. And I was humiliated. (I go to a private, good \nschool I'd like to add). That is hurtful, and us girls have to go through \nit every day. When I go out with my girlfriends, our asses get grabbed by \nrandom guys and we huddle together and clench hands whenever we walk past a \ngroup of men. I AM NOT one of those extremist feminists, because I stand \nfor equality in all things. Men, please tell what your problems are and \nthey will be resolved. That is what Emma is saying. She WANTS men to also \ntake part in this, to have their word and get their part. But hear this, \nall of you who are against what is trying to be done: A WOMAN gave birth to \nyou. Just imagine that all those girls living through these horrible things \nare your daughters, or your sisters, or your friends. How would you feel if \nthey had to leave to get married to a creepy old guy for money? Or not be \nable to study to become a vet like they've always wished to do? Or get \nraped tomorrow night? Just think that. And please, at least TRY to do \nsomething. Otherwise nothing will happen. You have it easy, men. Just try \nto understand women and women will try to understand you. Then it may work. \nThat is all Emma is meaning, she isn't trying to be soppy or emotional. She \nis just fighting for something she believes in. And to answer the question \nas to why chose an actress for this? To get attention, duh. If it was some \nrandom lady, so many less people would have heard about it, and so much \nless would be done. I sincerely hope I have convinced some men out there.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12vjnq4zvzgvna4v04cejdxvofjwjeprt00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAnpVSYWG_fcpJKiBjD7p_w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xr-P6VuaP5o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEEs/p6KwOcywTZs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "DJ Aladdin", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-31T04:19:50.049Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAnpVSYWG_fcpJKiBjD7p_w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.95944370000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-03-31T04:19:50.049Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102681342270916261138", "textDisplay": "i need women, to make my sandwich that is :D cheers and god bless\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ow3hhcr25c5q3d23tv3dg1kidsxaoy04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv7oqU1qHz8u3MT1jVjKR7w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-x_zfxYnsnm4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/Br_YuEOc15M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.42553191489361702, "authorDisplayName": "Iain G", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-12T03:34:22.417Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCv7oqU1qHz8u3MT1jVjKR7w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.42521600000000004, "formal_score": 19, "updatedAt": "2014-10-12T03:34:22.417Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115623238275295177543", "textDisplay": "Something I find ironic, is that so many feminists argue that 'Feminism is \nabout equality for men and women', yet I literally, in countless lecture \nhalls and tutorial rooms, in many online forums and mediums for discussion, \nhave never heard a self proclaimed feminist bring up and argue in support \nof an issue that men face.

Your \nspeech seems to be more about criticising men than it does about ensuring, \nfor example, equal pay for women. As a masculine, heterosexual male, I find \nthis incredibly offensive. If you criticise violence in relationships, I \nfully support this, having known women who have experienced violence from \ntheir male partners and having experienced violence myself from a female \npartner. But if you associate aggression exclusively with masculinity, this \nis ill-founded and deeply ignorant. If you criticise masculinity in total, \nyou criticise men for being men. That is tantamount to what you call \n'man-hating', whether you would define your beliefs as so or not. \n\nIn one breath you say that feminism has too often become synonymous with \nman hating, and then proceed to criticise men for being masculine, saying \nthat it is somehow only the result of peer pressure, as if men do not act \nin a masculine way of their own free will, but are as lemmings, mindless \ncopying their peers in an attempt to appear the most masculine. I also find \nthis extremely insulting and condescending. I am not unable to express my \nfeelings. When I have strong feelings I express them, but I find that many \nmen simply do not have the need to express strong feelings, which is often \na characteristic of maculinity itself. I did not abandon vulnerability and \nit does not make me less human, actually. I do not see that you have the \nright to tell me I am incomplete because I am not overly emotional. You \nsuggest that men do this because they are merely conforming to a gender \nstereotype. I suspect they would find this patronising as well. The men I \nam friends with are masculine because that is their nature, and they are \ncomfortable with this. I am comfortable with this, and I do not see why I \nshould have to change myself by 'getting in touch with my feminine side' in \norder to appear more socially acceptable to you. I am not imprisoned by a \ngender stereotype. You wish to get men on board, then say: well actually, \nthe way men behave is wrong and you need to change to be more socially \nacceptable. This is eerily similar to the attitude experienced by many gay \nmen, if from the opposite end of the spectrum. \n\nFor the record, I despise terms like 'man up', which I have to say I have \nonly ever heard uttered by women in criticism of men who are apparently not \nmasculine enough. If there is pressure to be masculine at all, I would say \nit comes from women at least as much if not more so than from other men. I \nwould expect a volume of boos if a man stood in the UN and suggested that a \nwoman acts feminine because she is told to by beauty magazines - although I \ndo acknowledge that the media has a toxic influence on young women, \nsomething which I cannot say I or anyone I know has ever experienced as a \nman. Who are you to criticise your friends if that is how they perceive \ntheir femininity? You say that when men are free of the prison of their \nmasculinity (which you associate merely with aggression, control and lack \nof sensitivity) then women will be freer as well. I do not understand the \nlogic of this at all. Masculinity is not all about aggression and control. \nGaining more rights for women will not be achieved by attempting to \neliminate masculinity. I believe you are wrong on both counts. Are you \nsuggesting that the way to improve women's lives is for men to stop being \nmasculine? I do not accept this and if I feel any oppression at all at this \nmoment, it is coming from you.\n\nFar from addressing the perception of feminism, this speech simply raises \nmore questions for me.

How can you \nspeak of equal respect, when you show men nothing but patronising contempt? \nHow do you expect to get more men to support your HeForShe campaign when \nyou alienate men such as myself with such ill-founded, cynical ideas? How \ncan you expect people to look beyond the negative connotations of the word \nfeminism to the higher ideals when you seem incapable of doing so yourself? \nHow can you speak of freedom and accepting ourselves when you suggest that \nI should not accept myself as I am? I am not thinking: \"Who is this Harry \nPotter girl, and why is she speaking at the UN?\" I am thinking: \"How does \nthis person not realise that she has accomplished exactly what she has \nsought to avoid?\" As long as you cannot see this, the unity you speak of \nwill not happen.

They hurt MORE than adults because they have not \nlearned how to handle pain...even emotional ones. Hell, babies will cry if \n\"looked at\" meanly. \n\nYoung kids are like whole teeth. As the movie \"Marathon Man\" showed, if you \nthink probing a dental cavity is painful, try drilling into a perfect \ntooth: it will cause you to pass out.\n\nWhy? Because the cavity had a chance to adapt. Just like adults. Children, \nlike whole teeth, have not. So they experience things much more deeply and \noceanically. They know they are totally dependent...and here a giant hits \nthem! If they get mad, they fear being beaten more,  not being fed, etc.\n\nAnd those abuses, coming early in life, stay longer. Like impressions of \npalms in new-poured cement.\n\nAdults who would never accept their own work-boss smacking them with a \npaddle for not \"performing sufficiently\" think it's okay to hit children. \nSuch people should not be allowed to have kids. Each slap they deliver is \nan admission of their own parental failings.\n\nUnless they get therapy, smacked kids will grow into people who hit their \nown kids. And think it fine.\n\nAnd were wonder where all the wars and conflicts in the world come from!\n\nMiller was asked why every abused/smacked kid doesn't become abusive in \nturn. She said having an Enlightened Witness was key: someone who sees your \nsuffering and takes it seriously....even if they can't change the \nsituation. They let the hurt/hit child know they don't deserve their abuse.\n\nAlas, too many hurt kids grow up hurting others. You see this with Janay \nRice...who felt free to hit her now-husband former-NFL player three (3!) \ntimes with impunity. You see it with black celebs saying most NFL players \nraised in the South were \"whupped\" as kids...and now think it okay to hit \ntheir wives. Such men are merely showing their \"love\" to women by hitting \nthem...just like their own mothers did.\n\nOddly, fathers who justify physically hitting their kids, would punch any \nman who \"just\" spat on them.\n\nKids learn to obey such parents. They fear them, though, not love them. \n\nIf you HAVE to hit your child, let him/her smash your head in return with a \nbaseball bat....mkay?\n\nWhy leave scissors, etc. around? Are parents doing enough to instruct and \nprotect their children? Hold your child, explain things, etc. If you don't \nhave the time or patience to do that, don't have kids!\n\nMost parents treat their iPhones, pets, and home-theatre equipment better \nthan their own kids.\n\nOf course, none of what I say willl matter to abusive parents who, of \ncourse, don't see themselves as abusive. They will justify their lack of \ntrue Christian charity by mewling such tripelike \"we're born selfish \nsinners.\" Nonsense! Babies aren't sinners. Only parents who justify their \nown parents' abuse will say \"I must have done something wrong.\" Otherwise \nthey'd have to admit the real \"sin\" was their parents' thinking it was okay \nto hit weaker others.\n\nYou know, like Jesus did when he flogged all the kids he met...right?\n\nThe biblical \"rod\" was the staff used by shepherds...not to beat sheep, but \nto protect and lead them, fending off wolves and other dangers. \"Spoiling \nthe child\" by not properly using the rod/staff was a warning: \"If you don't \nproperly guide your children with love, they will grow up warped.\"\n\nMiller said she never read about, interviewed, or met a murderer who hadn't \nbeen physically \"disciplined\" as a child.\n\nAGAIN: children are not \"little adults.\" Their feelings are much tenderer, \ntheir needs met by others. To think that a spanked kid does not feel deep \npain, deep humiliation, deep confusion, and deep shame (and rage!) is to \ndeny reality.\n\nOnce you hit a child you've broken the bond of trust. It's as simple as \nthat. Yet clueless parents will say that \"discipline teaches limits, cause \nand effect, and most importantly focus.\"\n\nRight. So does putting a gun to someone's head.\n\nThe world is full of meathead \"Great Santinis\" who are bulliles at heart. \nMost grew up with bullying parents who also thought it okay to hit \nchildren. Such misguided parents are legion. \n\nPat Conroy writes a lot about such clueless chuckleheads and the pain they \nspread. Parents who let their babies cry forever, tell kids to be seen and \nnot heard, and so on. \n\nRead Pat, Alice Miller, John Bowlby, and others regarding the importance of \nnon-violent bonding for children. \n\nAs for the meatheads, I despair. They smack their kids, lying that it hurts \nthem MORE. Sorry, such parents get off on their power, It's now THEIR turn \nto do unto their spawn what their parents did to them. They often brag \nabout not hitting in anger, as if being a cold-blooded abuser is a good \nthing!\n\nThey also say fear is good, blind to the power of love and the damage that \nfearing your own caregivers does.\n\nHave you ever seen a truly loved person willingly cause someone else pain? \nHoward Stern was viciously mocked at Boston University. His whole career is \nbased on seeking revenge. Of course, he won't go after those whoh tormented \nhim. Instead he looks for those who remind him of his vulnerable younger \nself. He finds \"freaks and geeks\" (stutterers, pinheads, fat minority \nwomen, etc.) and mocks them on-air...all the while saying he's doing it for \ntheir own good/careers/etc.\n\nLike abusive parents justifying their smacks as \"love.\"\n\nSomehow Fred. Rogers managed to have a long media career, too, without ever \nmaking  others feel bad.\n\nBut again, macho muchachos will never admit they were hurt by their \nparents' hits. It's what makes them macho: having to stuff feelings. They \nhad to bury the pain they felt when adults who claimed to love them treated \nthem like \"things.\"\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12hyr3hatauxrtk4224g1ebguvvdvuit04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNGJPwb2Ce820he8b1n_i9A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7UXrcmfTHE0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJI/MiVGuCd0qTA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jenkkimie", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T20:16:34.035Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNGJPwb2Ce820he8b1n_i9A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.62974200000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T20:16:34.035Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109765740453380694198", "textDisplay": "Did anyone else notice how her speech was about 1st world countries despite \nthe fact that she traveled around the world in 3rd world countries.

It is this preferable blackmail that I believe has led to much of \nthe erroneously perceived aggression feminism has pointed out about men. \nFeminism is hypocritical in that it still wants to maintain this innate \nmodel yet benefit and exploit the fruits of mens labor but without \naccountability.There is no doubt that without all the attributes that men \nin general have supplied to our modern society, there would be no \nfeminism. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13esb0iyqfzvt4r104cjrdj5r2jclvbik00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZH2Ik0udN7Xl1eSyfLjvmA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "William Struthers", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T14:53:26.873Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZH2Ik0udN7Xl1eSyfLjvmA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.77205400000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T14:53:26.873Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103383258876770278610", "textDisplay": "lol yes hollywood has turned women into useless zombies, and she has made \nmillions off this. what a joke.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13hhpvbsk3mcnj5l04chfua5ke2fnsj42g": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6CXHZHjgq6Cl4Mm8QFO2VQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Shade Draws", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T12:42:14.152Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6CXHZHjgq6Cl4Mm8QFO2VQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99999984746299997, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T12:42:14.152Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105364412310679574100", "textDisplay": "I prefer #meforme.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z122s5dx0mqdu54ub23gtthojqzihhbc5": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAFrHIoA2j6XIoMYkzcvpmA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "dashdeception", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-14T14:04:04.692Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAFrHIoA2j6XIoMYkzcvpmA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.24178000000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-12-14T14:04:04.692Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117961422448170459174", "textDisplay": "is she wearing anything under that trench coat? \n\nbut serious, she has suffered so much what a brave woman\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13sfp0zsq3kcfpet23tedcjvpmds3zr104": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb2SSh9thZa3jBYFZwMm2-A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5Wn9vgymbsk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADo/veOz0q_YbNs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "John Smith", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-22T15:54:06.065Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCb2SSh9thZa3jBYFZwMm2-A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.93898019999999993, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-11-22T15:54:06.065Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106177707248108676097", "textDisplay": "Wait....you mean the patriarchy isn't real!!??

Look at children from the 1930's \nand 50's and look at children now, it wasn't perfect then but children were \nfar more respectful, humble and a lot less arrogant.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13yjz0admilehdnt234j5lrsynnwt2cg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxXPPSoTbA28PoBl5kkGA2Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0AR1VRAp9s0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAV4/cn4l1YohgHk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Yes dickhead, my avatar is a pony", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T15:39:13.004Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxXPPSoTbA28PoBl5kkGA2Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.89785170000000003, "formal_score": 52, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T15:39:13.004Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109878649178752013173", "textDisplay": "And after this speech Saudi women will no longer be forced to wear burqas.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13mh3pa3omwgv5ol04cgnpqmpjaw34jbtg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY9qPGJ4DktTb3mprucFBfA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Diego Cezar Magalh\u00e3es", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-10T18:01:05.844Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCY9qPGJ4DktTb3mprucFBfA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.72113200000000011, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-10T18:01:05.844Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114812470155253106613", "textDisplay": "She's a pretty little thing, isn't she?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12exjog4vvyildba04cdfrpvoebtztwu5s": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXtzRoObwDNWGO5kbQ3uaoA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-h9qa07C58Sc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACA/D7hah0Cxa9U/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Assassin55555", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T22:49:58.457Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXtzRoObwDNWGO5kbQ3uaoA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.28655800000000003, "formal_score": 6, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T22:49:58.457Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113484593749926446761", "textDisplay": "What ever let them have their speeches.

Ms. Watson says, \"For the record, feminism *by definition* is the \nbelief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is \nthe theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.\"\n\nNot only does the behavior of *feminists in general* (if you, Stefan, \nweren't a libertarian, I'd have said \"the collective behavior of feminists\" \nwith the opinion that it means the same thing) contradict Ms. Watson's \nstatement \u2014 a thing is what it is in *practice,* not what it *should have \nbeen* in theory \u2014 but the very word FEM-in-ism blatantly suggests a \npartiality toward the female side of things. If feminism were what Ms. \nWatson said it was, then the *gaffe* inherent in its one-word summary label \nmust be among the largest in history.\n\nDoes anyone know whether the tremulous quality of Ms. Watson's voice is \naffected, or whether she always speaks like that?\n\nGood point 6:14 to 6:47. The toned muscles of well-exercised women look as \ngood to the male eye as does the gender-reverse. I suspect that this was \nmerely a rolling verbal add-on, a padding of the word-count, by Ms. Watson: \nSomething-More-To-Say, in the hope it would fly under the critical radar.\n\n10:10. Is \"the cycle of violence\" (parents hitting kids making kids much \nmore likely to grow into adults who hit their kids, making those kids more \nlikely...) a well-documented phenomenon, with peer-reviewed scientific \nstudies to prove it with statistics? If it is, can you link to those \nstudies and to critical reviews of those studies? (There are few scientific \nstudies that have been so perfectly accomplished that *nobody* ventures \ncriticism about the validity of the procedure, or the sureness of the \nauthors' conclusions.) Intuitively, it sounds good that there ought to be \nsuch a thing as a \"cycle of violence,\" but intuition is sometimes wrong.\n\n21:44. Perhaps the failure of feminists such as Ms. Watson to consider that \nshe must first understand what men want before she can effectively enlist \nthe cooperation of men, isn't stupidity, but is politically motivated \nevasion. I've heard it said that feminism has two endorsements, one from \nMarxism and one from corporate capitalism. The Marxists, of course, want to \nset up a global communist state with themselves in power. The capitalists \nwant to make more profit. While feminism, in its actual operation, has been \ntearing apart families, and thus pleasing the Marxists with the destruction \nof an institution rival to the state, the capitalists are pleased with the \nopportunities for greater profit that arise from the way alimony and child \nsupport usually work. They both involve the forcible transfer of money from \nrelatively frugal men to relatively profligate women. By this means, the \ncapitalists sell more junk and make more profit.\n\n25:03 - 25:11. \"If men don't have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, \nwomen won't feel compelled to be submissive.\" *Ha ha ha ha!* AS IF women \nare going to accept any timid, deferential beta male, while giving the Cold \nShoulder to nearby aggressive alpha males! *Very funny!* Women have never \nacted that way, and they never will. And experience with that fact is why \nmen are often more aggressive than Aunt Nellie standards of politeness \nwould call for them to be.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ayviz2rntfhovk22zx30jhwfgshnjv04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ_cazfNaAnWmpFKfG7J_4w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "david22202", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-03T13:32:28.360Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZ_cazfNaAnWmpFKfG7J_4w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99824439599999992, "formal_score": 97, "updatedAt": "2014-10-03T13:32:28.360Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111571146069696753692", "textDisplay": "Most excellent arguments as always Sir!!!!!!

That's not to say, for example, that \npeople who are raped were deserving because they chose to be around their \nrapist(s) or had committed violence in the past.

It's a team effort. Humans stopping other humans from being \nviolent idiots. Which may mean, for some, stopping yourself from being \nviolent. There's never an excuse to harm someone.

As for what men \nwant, I thought it was obvious that women shouldn't be given a leg up above \nthem, in education or parenting or jobs or anything. To me, equality meant, \nIDK, being equal? I dislike the segregation of men and women that's \nhappened over the course of human history. I dislike it intensely. We \nshould be able to have, say, a gender neutral public bathroom and not freak \nout about it. Small thing, I know, but it all matters. Child abuse matters. \nThe normalisation of violence matters. Why do you think we have a rape \nculture? Because we normalised it, said it was the victim's fault, that the \nviolence was ok. From childhood, people learnt it was okay to take what \nthey wanted and to hell with permission. Men, women and children suffer \nfrom rape and violence in general.

As asserting it's positive in the face of well put together and \nresearched critique which quite accurately and accessibly highlighted the \nglaring contradictions in her logic, as well as the host of faulty premises \nwhich said logic attempts to build it's house of cards on. The reality is \nnot hard to grasp, this speech, was little more than PR theater, attempting \nto soften the brand of feminism, likely in response/reaction to the growing \nMGTOW movement and MRA gaining traction. There was no skeptical \nreexamination of the premises the ideology of feminism is based on, no \ncritical re-evaluation of the logic supporting feminism's conclusions and \npolicies, only a vague appeal to emotion, and at best an admission of what \nhas been glaringly obvious about the movement since it's early rise to \nprominence. Now, if this theater was accompanied by any real substantive \nre-evaluation of feminism, much of the criticism (at least my personal \ncriticism) would be moot, or at least mitigated. But, too often this kind \nof feel-good re-branding actually prevents any real self-exploration or \nquestioning by those involved, and actually serves to reinforce the current \nattitudes and beliefs, as these kinds of shallow substance-less episodes \nwill be held up by the believers as a shield against all those \nuncomfortable contradictions and preconceptions that currently prevent a \nmovement supposedly aimed at gender *equality* from even addressing \ninequalities that do not fit their pre-constructed narrative. \n\nNone of this means that women suffer no discrimination or ill-bias, nor \ndoes it mean that no issue trumpeted by feminism has merit. It merely goes \nto show that, in my opinion feminism has fallen into the same trap as most \nrevolutionary ideologies, that of self-reinforcement and an inability to be \nself-critical let alone objective in their assessments and proscriptions, \nas well as the usual refusal to admit and back down from past mistakes."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey1F8YQ4HHdI7zqpCtIgUw", "inappropriate_score": 0.11198208286674133, "authorDisplayName": "superstd", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125c1txhqbmylo3423adrtjmoqru33he04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-18T20:33:40.099Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCey1F8YQ4HHdI7zqpCtIgUw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.45206400000000002, "formal_score": 32, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-18T20:33:40.099Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--1xriCHes_k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/yN_MWqPiwOg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104931079025389409030", "textDisplay": "+limptastic genesis\n\"Not a statement purely on the behalf of first world countries\"\njust like :\n-manspreading\n-mansplaining\n-banbossy\n-wage gap myth\n-1/4 women in college will be raped\n-rape culture\na world problem ?\n\nall of those claimed by feminist and by beyonce ,hillary clinton, even \npresident barrack obama is the WORLD PROBLEM ?\n\nplease ^^ , cut the bullshit .\nshe said the usual defending of feminism 101\n\"fighting for womens rights has often be synonymous with man hating , this \nhas to stop\"\nthis is an excuse language to pardon feminism, feminism has no purpose .\nsorry i dont consider manspreading/ etc feminist problem to be a problem .\n\n\"If you think her speech did nothing to help men in their fight for \nequality then I have to disagree with you. this was a speech in feminism \n101, meaning, she can't cover every single little nuance\"\nit doesnt help men at all , he for she is for MALE helping FEMALE.\nits just a speech to :\n1. squash any dissent against feminism\n2. and to protect the name of feminism\n3. and also to pander to men suffering so they can use them .\nusual feminism 101 = brainwashing .\n\n\"Its ignorant to think every feminist is a man-hater\"\nwhen did i say EVERY ? sorry , *its your delusion* , i respected factual \nfeminist like christina hoff summer .\n\nis beyonce, hillary clinton, president barrack obama an extremist feminist ?\nthey believe in feminist nonsense like ban bossy, wage gap myth, 1/4 women \nin college will be raped.\n\n\"I honestly am done defending her speech\"\nand i am cracking her speech because its not as innocent as you put , sorry \nif it hurts your feelings .\n1. she wants to squash any dissent of feminism as if theres no good reason \nfor against feminism .\n2. she use trick language \"fighting for womens rights\" = feminism .\nsorry, feminism has not fighting for womens rights for almost a decade , \nthey fight for nonsense like *manspreading*.\npresident barrack obama even forced to fights against wage gap myth which \nalready enacted in the law already because he needs to pander to feminism .\n3. very sexist towards male , male do not need to be like women in order to \nbe human .\n4. only said bad things happen to male in suicide and someother ,but dont \nwant to say anything about why is that , simple because the law is \nmisandrist / gynocentric , she cant say that though, why would she care .\n\nthe whole point of he for she is for *male to be useful for female* , thats \nit .\nreverse that label and feminist would go ape and they would scream misogyny \nover and over .\n\nyou dont even think thats its misandrist, thats how brainwashed you are ."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgDRq4D-yZHAc_sG6fNmSZQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "limptastic genesis", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z125c1txhqbmylo3423adrtjmoqru33he04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-18T20:02:28.964Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgDRq4D-yZHAc_sG6fNmSZQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.41764000000000001, "formal_score": 20, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-18T20:02:28.964Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106383046163319093623", "textDisplay": "This was a U.N. address.

For example:\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/equal-pay/career\n\n\"On average, full-time working women earn just 77 cents for every dollar a \nman earns.\"\n\n http://womenemployed.org/equal-opportunity\n\n\"Discrimination at work is still a fact of life for too many women. Women \nearn just 77 percent of men\u2019s wages on average. Women still face \ndiscrimination in pay and promotions and barriers to advancement because of \nfamily responsibilities. Some employers still haven\u2019t gotten the message on \nsexual harassment. These problems are compounded for women in low-paying \njobs because they fear losing their jobs if they speak up about unfair or \nillegal treatment. Women Employed\u2019s work to expand legal protections and \nstrengthen existing laws\u2014and make sure the laws are effectively enforced\u2014is \nmore important than ever.\"\n\nhttp://wall.oise.utoronto.ca/inequity/7baxter.pdf\n\nThe glass ceiling is another problem that women face in the work force. \n\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/us/07iht-letter07.html?_r=0\n\n\"No country is spared. Even in the most advanced countries, she said, where \nwomen have been elected presidents or prime ministers, female candidates \nare still subjected to sexist jokes and comments, salary gaps persist, and \nthere are too few women in major public and business positions.\"\n\nhttp://forwomen.org/moretodo\n\n\"Despite the successes of the women\u2019s movement over the last 40 years, \nsignificant\nbarriers to full equality and inclusion remain, particularly for \nmarginalized women.\nThis report proposes a benchmark for the status of women today and a guide \nto critical\npolicy changes that can help women overcome challenges in the areas of \neconomic\njustice, reproductive justice and safety.\"\n\nhttp://pol.moveon.org/waronwomen/\n\nThese are why we continue to fight.

I wonder why some white men who have mothers, wives, sisters and \ndaughters want to control women and their reproductive rights? Perhaps \nthese men are afraid of women\u2019s sexuality and power, much as some white \npeople fear black and brown people.

And women are mad.\"\n\n\"Maybe -- like so many other women in this country, regardless of political \norientation -- I'm feeling a bit more appalled than usual by the blatant \ndisrespect (to put it politely and mildly) women continue to be shown by \nmen.\"\n\n\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2014/07/25/news/economy/rights-pregnant-workers/\n\n\n\"Women still get fired simply because they're pregnant.\"\n\n\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/pregnancy_guidance.cfm#stereo\n\n\n\"Adverse treatment of pregnant women often arises from stereotypes and \nassumptions about their job capabilities and commitment to the job.

One possibility is that property division is \nsubstituting for spousal maintenance awards. Another possibility is the \nperception that women have sufficient job opportunities to become \nself-supporting immediately after divorce. A third factor is that, due to \ncustody law reforms in the late 20th century, physical placement after a \ndivorce is likely to be equal or nearly equal between the parties, so there \nis no reason to pay the woman to stay home with minor children, even if she \nwas the primary caretaker before the divorce.\"\n\n\nhttp://hosted.law.wisc.edu/wordpress/wjlgs/files/2014/07/McMullen-article.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear lord, they should just get rid of this thing entirely.

Every human being; there are preferred \"gendered\" \nways in which society expresses their emotion openly (speaking specifically \nof the west) i.e anger in men, sadness in women.\n\nEven though both men and women feel both these same emotions too, the \nprocessing can be different, but we don't know if that is due to our \n'nature or nurture' as we know socialisation hugely impacts our cognitive \ndevelopment.\n\nIn decision making emotions play a larger part than most would like to \nadmit, especially those who view themselves as 'hyper-masculine'. \n\nDecision making is largely subconscious, \"Common emotional decisions may \nuse some logic, but the main driving force is emotion, which either \noverrides logic or uses a pseudo-logic to support emotional choices (this \nis extremely common)\". Antonio Damasio\n\nAntonio also found while studying subjects with brain injuries, \nspecifically where their were emotions are generated.The interesting thing \nhe found was that their ability to make decisions was seriously impaired, \nby the loss of their emotions.\n\nHis other studies point to exactly the same thing; \n\n\"research where the subject's brain was wired up to recorders and the \nsubject was asked to simply press a red button at any time. The notion was \nthat if the conscious mind was in charge, then that part of the brain would \nbe seen to change first, an if the decision started in the subconscious, \nthen electrical activity in that part of the brain would work first. And \nthe answer was...that the subconscious started activity first. As emotions \nalso stem from the subconscious, then this makes it even more likely that \ndecisions have a strong emotional influence.\"\n\nThe 'men have no emotions, or don't feel emotions the same' trope is tired. \nWe all feel emotions the same, some people process emotions differently, \nbecause of injuries, past trauma, emotional childhood abuse etc but \nemotions aren't gendered and neither is 'rational' decision making. Anger \nis a socially acceptable emotion for men, which is why more men show their \nanger and act upon it. Sadness is a socially acceptable emotion for women, \nwhich is why more women show their sadness and act upon it. \n\nI know this wont change how you feel, or even what you think.

There are now also diet programs to stop people from \nlooking to fat, there are hospitals that aim to show people how dangerous \ndifference is and there seems to be a lot less focus on the health that all \nthis stigmas causes on an individual, and this means that the most damage \nis caused by an inability to be kind and tolerant of one another which \nbuilds up over time as depression anxiety, and increased anger, and \npersonally I think that all judge mentation of different groups whether it \nis in professional journal articles or whether it is news paper mags, or \nanything that judges a non \u2013dangerous part of human society should not be \nproduced, and instead if something kills and people areas still eating it \nmeans that the substance is addictive, and the person should have to wear a \nsingle increment of blame and because everyone is now so use to blaming \nothers, it is only clear to me more than ever that if you want to wipe out \nthe prejudices that lurk in the normalised community that re created we \nmight have to redesign pretty much everything, everything that contains \nprejudice about the way in which people look, and behavioural disorders, \nand everything that effects someone\u2019s self-esteem, such as make-up, \neverything needs to be remodelled so that people feel a lot less pressure \nwhen walking down a busy street, this ais also a reason why social anxiety \nhas never been higher than ever before, and the fact people then blame the \nperson for the social anxiety is simply another example of how society \nviews others that are a bit different due to the circumstances surrounding \nthe individual with contempt, and getting rid of everything that causes \njudgement would be a milestones in the community. We know that every single \ndisease symptoms get enhanced when people are anxious and depressed for a \nperiod of time, we know that cancer cells are a lot more likely to be \ndeveloped in populations that feel stigmatized by there community rather \nthan people that don\u2019t feel stigmatized by there community we also know \nthat people need to be more accepting anyway so lets design a new model of \nhealthcare where peoples end result is that no one gets judged by walking \ndown a busy street. No labels should be given, rather the sickness get \ntreated and any statistic that says a certain gender is more likely to \ndevelop something than another gender should be placed in the bin because \nof the anxiety that these sought of statistics cause to the general \npopulation, same with statistics that say \u201cpeople with adhd, aere more \nlikely to develop this, and this\u201d because anxiety is caused by the way in \nwhich people treat each other rather than the way that the person treats \nhimself, and everything you know personalities that are developed over time \nis that they are intergenerational they actually get passed down form one \ngeneration towards another generation, and this means that it is extremely \nimportant that in the next 50 years we get this right, because if we don\u2019t \nin our community the rates of depression related illnesses such as \nsubstance abuse of most substances, increased heart disease occurrence, \ncancers, even the exacerbating of type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance, \n all these condition are produced by judgement, all increased severity of \nsymptoms would probably be decreased, the world that we live in would be a \nfar better place. Because what you are exposed to is what a person is more \nlikely to do. Depression also causes violence, as a happy non-judgemental \nperson would never deliberately inflict suffering on another individual, it \nonly when people bottle up there emotions because of all the stereotypes \naround when they become violent and angry with sequence outbursts which \noften load to physical violence, in drug communities, anger against \nproducers. Judging is always wrong, and we need to get into the habit of \nmaking sure that this process that everyone talks about doesn\u2019t happen in \nthe minds of other people. People should know longer be judged by there \nappearance, by the spelling mistakes they make, by the quality of \nreferences but rather by the quality of the ideas, and by any amount of \nprejudiced languages that attach itself to certain groups of society, also \nbrands that are gender specific should be replaced with brands that souit \neveryone, and marketing programs that a split the genders should be able to \nnot be produced bas it leads to judging and stereotypes of other groups of \npeople. Materials that contain sexualised images such as pornography and \nsexualised billboards should not be allowed to be produced unless they \ncontain almost no levels of discrimination towards any group that includes, \nage, sex and gender. If we can get this right, disease rates will go down, \nhunger rates will go down as people spend less time worrying about the way \npeople will view them and more time getting on with producing products and \nwill suffer far less mental illnesses on top of that, they will suffer less \nsevere disease less cancer, less dementia, and will be able to better live \ngood quality lives that are free of mental strain of how do I look when I \nwalk down a busy street. All substances that are known to be addictive such \nas gambling machines that promote sex, or sexual objects, prostitution, \nstrip clubs, all prejudice things should at least be rebranded with \nmaterial that mean it is not gender-specific or discriminates against any \ngender in any way. Alcoholic drinks, sugary drinks, or any drinks that are \nknown to be addictive should advertise itself in commercials without any \nthing the causes social dividing, such as making sure that the worn and the \nmen in the adds wear the same types of clothing and make sure that they \ndon\u2019t look flash and hot, but they look as if they are normal citizens of \nthe world.  Laws should target discrimination in all of its forms, and \ncompanies should be slapped with a fine every time they produce something \nthat would most likely increase the stigma or discrimination of any group \ninclude people effected by down syndrome, or any discriminatory label of \nany kind. Judge mentation does claim lives, because it destroys the soul \nand tries so hard now to make people the same as each other, and fails to \nimply the importance of having differences that can make a difference in \nthe world. If an essay has prejudice or bigotry or any discrimination in \nit, it should be edited so that the language in the essay does not in \nanyway discriminate against groups for example instead of assaying obese, \nsay people can feel better if they consume more fruit and vegetables, or if \nit is a topic about smoking, rather then saying that smokers should stop \nsmoking and putting the blame on the individuals that smoke say phrasing \nlike cigarettes are more likely to cause disease, but because it is more \naddictive, a smoker may need more time to give up the substance and may \nrequire extra care from family members and friend. And the list goes on, \ninstead of saying adhd, say myer briggs personality and find out what \nthings individuals are good at and what they need improving on, saying that \npeople have disabilities because they are a bit different is almost like \nsaying, that everyone who thinks this way is allowed into the circle of \nhumanity, which is wrong people should be allowed to walk the street \nwithout any sense of being forced to conform with everything that goes on \naround them, kids with disabilities should undergo a Myer brigs personality \ntest to discover what they are good at and get them to focus on those \nqualities rather then telling constantly that you have disability and that \nlife is going to be harder for you, as this decreases self-esteem and \nincreases anxiety and depression rates. Also they should not be medicated \nbecause they are different because we want to be not stigmatised against \nanymore, people are getting sick and tired of here stigmatising labels in \nresearch, people want to live in harmony and unless people can stop judging \neach other by there differences, by their appearance of all nature, things \nare going to get worst, rates of anxiety and depression are going to \ncontinue to rise, there will be higher usages of anti-depressants leading \nmore incidence of manic episodes, and the chain reactions can be seen in \nmatter of fact all around the world, as productive is decreased and less \nways for producing happiness,, sharing food, sharing water, slowing of \nscientific methods to people feeling like they are inadequate means that \npeople in Africa cant get as much food, because the productively levels do \ngo down when people continuously judge each other, and so does very induced \ncrime, and increased in levels of anger in a community which leads to \nhigher rates of violent outbursts in communities and higher rates of abuse \ntowards others and higher rates of feelings of oppression. Its time that we \nas a community get this right, that everyone should be allowed to walk down \nthe streets without any judgement, and medications that say symptoms like \nanxiety, depression, possible chance of any condition that effect the psych \nshould next be allowed to pass thee TBA and have undergo changes to improve \nthe happiness of people who are taking the medication instead, and make \nsure that doctors stop using language that invokes discrimination when \ndiagnosing there patients, they should be using language such as your \nreally good at things, it is not because you are fat it is just because you \nare unlucky, and don\u2019t even say it is not because your fat. Doctors should \nnever hand medications that decrease happiness, and there always need s to \na background check between how people feel when they walk in a community do \nthey feel welcomed or do they feel judged and stigmatised by people in \ngeneral, is there an overall sense that increases rate of depression and \nanxiety because anxiety increases blood pressure, common sense, it \nincreases metabolic rates as the body needs to absorb nutrients faster or \nslower in order to keep up with the change in eating habits that people \nwith anxiety and depression of go into, they needs to be better \nunderstanding of peoples school life, so they are not taught to judge \nsomeone by how fat they are, or how skinny, or there appearance, or there \nnon-dangering but weird behaviours that do not cause a threat to other \npeople, and they are engaged in activities that don\u2019t involve the splitting \nof males with females, as this increases anxiety of the genders by get the \nclass to remodelling treating a different gender of the same species as if \nthey are another animal, and will better allows makes and females to \nexclude prejudice ideas like a male and female should always look good, and \nbehave appropriately and classmates should be taught how to critique people \nthat might say a comment whether it is medical journal research or just a \nsimple comment that contains any sought of prejudice towards another group \nof people, and what words the should say in order to diffuse the situation. \nPrejudice doesn\u2019t effect just the classroom, if you are exposed constantly \nto prejudice towards a certain group even if it is one class, whether it is \nin masters, or oin grade 4, you are more like to subconsciously put that \ngroup of people down in your head which then leads to larger divisions in \nthe broader community and less cooperation. People need to be able to walk \ndown the streets without prejudice and that is what my masters degree wants \nto try and tackle, my masters might be very controversial in the sense that \npeople around the world would have to change the way that they speak and \nbehave towards other groups iof people, but the end result will be a more \nloving, nurturing and caring environment where everyone is admired by the \nstrengths of what they can contribute to society and rather on there \npotential flaws. \n\nAnd peace is what everyone should at the end of the day be striving for, no \nmore exploiting of mines to make money, no more exploiting of other people \nresources, no more making peoples lives worst so that your life can be \nbetter, and no more exploiting of native land s to make your pockets better \nto use, there also needs to be a radical change in which people view each \nother as the current way is too judgemental, and too focused on making \ncashed to be correct, because at the end of the day, what you do now will \nhave an impact on every single generation that comes after, meaning that it \nwill be remembered, and it is a lot better to be remembered for good things \nsuch as improving the liv3es of animals and humans alike and less on making \nsure that everyone is excessively wealthy and apathetic to issues that \nshould concern them more.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z133cx5g4obiyl1pd04cdn2jks2gzfwitv00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJCBwILKeamDToVTdQKU2w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ric Aldrich", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-08T09:29:42.471Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUJCBwILKeamDToVTdQKU2w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.81466569999999994, "formal_score": 4, "updatedAt": "2014-10-08T09:29:42.471Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113197050051011639609", "textDisplay": "I wish these actors would do something constructive with their fame.

At \nbest you could ask for more positive male portrayals in the media and to \nremain consistent with gender equality you would ask the same for female \nportrayals.\n\nWhile i am sure the physical attacks in youth do contribute to the \naggression in men, i doubt it is the only reason men are aggressive, nor \ndid u claim it was, so i agree we should find an alternative non violent \nmethod to discipline children, i am not saying women are to blame though, \nequally fathers are violent, this is an issue with both sexes.\n\nBy the end i found you to have gone off of what Emma Watson actually said \nand instead made her out to be one of the lunatic feminists claiming the \npatriarchy, time will tell if she does become one of those but nothing in \nher speech said women were helpless in need of men to come support and save \nwomen, she merely said men don't seem as involved in the gender equality \ndebate as women are, so she invites more men so we can fight the gender \nissues together.\n\nLets say for example only women and gay men had got involved in the equal \nrights of homosexuals, whilst the rest of men were homophobic or silent on \nthe issue, this would have been an ineffective movement, however if \nstraight men also got involved the movement worked, the same will be of \ngender equality. We need men and women supporting the issues of each side.\nMaybe i have a rose tinted view of her speech and am giving her too much \nbenefit of the doubt, the only complaint i would give is the stuff she left \nout.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z120gjow3sivhhhe5225g3rw5sahcjvn4": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewaywhXjF8TQeLdfjql5QA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ilWBBVNp7es/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQU/yw_yUSIQ5_M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Marcara081", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-01T04:39:05.774Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCewaywhXjF8TQeLdfjql5QA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.14462400000000003, "formal_score": 4, "updatedAt": "2014-10-01T04:39:05.774Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108381426193978834225", "textDisplay": "Not her best acting IMO.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13xdpmbpvq4cjlxt04ccxna4z20vxjishc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM0IEwS6pKrUyiDVQTLZjKA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-r556Kp3Xbpg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGD8/5OICpUnDblE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jonathon Gillis", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T19:12:33.667Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCM0IEwS6pKrUyiDVQTLZjKA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.97459589999999996, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T19:12:33.667Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107636577631233507267", "textDisplay": "Great video and research.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12tuphrmkb1chjg404ch5sajp3isvmyals0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEI2Ky1Zf8pZWA98y43WDuA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2-S_t85g_IM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADI/Wu9K4U6PVvw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.88495575221238942, "authorDisplayName": "Bel Rick", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T09:57:36.696Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEI2Ky1Zf8pZWA98y43WDuA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.011933999999999945, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T09:57:36.696Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102188003161307421068", "textDisplay": "Feminism by definition (it is not gender neutral ms Watson, for a smart \nwoman you are pretty stupid to miss that obvious fact but i digress) is the \nbelief that men and women should have equal rights...\nSo to promote this I Emma Watson is now launching a new campaign, #heforshe \n but not #sheforhe  because fuck men.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z123gljybrjny10uf23jxvajhnnbi5pnh": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBjrEn71u1yK2RQZ8Y7dKQg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ginganz13", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-02T20:28:00.916Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCBjrEn71u1yK2RQZ8Y7dKQg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.74676600000000004, "formal_score": 44, "updatedAt": "2014-10-02T20:28:00.916Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105498903572798512932", "textDisplay": "She also tries to make a causal link between sexism and male suicide citing \nthat suicide is the leading cause of death in young men.

As for being \"muscly\", \nI can only assume that refers to the phenomenon by which TONE is favored in \nthe female physique, but MASS is almost universally considered unfeminine.\n\nIf you think women don't require the aid of men in the quest for equality, \nthen your awareness of historical and current oppression is shockingly \nlimited.  Blacks in America would never have won equal rights...or freedom \nfrom slavery for that matter...without the cooperation of the power-holding \nWhites, and the same is true of the battle for feminine equality.  The fact \nis throughout most of the world, especially in Africa and Asia, male power \nis still absolute.  Don't make the mistake of perceiving that your own, \nsafe, socially insulated Western existence is the \nglobal norm.  Male-enacted laws and the male-dominated religious traditions \non which they are based are the top tools of feminine oppression.  For most \nwomen, \"What you can achieve, right now, today,\" is NOTHING!  \"The kind of \nprotection women have had throughout history,\" IN AMERICA may demonstrate \nhow the world SHOULD BE, but it is by no means indicative of how the world \nIS.  \n \nThat said, I've worked in law enforcement for over thirteen years, and I \nabsolutely agree that, while men are statistically more commonly the \naggressors, they are by no means ALWAYS the aggressors.  Moreover, one must \nalso mitigate any abuse statistics with the fact that many men are too \nashamed to report their victimization.  Interestingly, the eradication of \nthis stigma is a secondary effect of he He For She agenda, allowing men to \nfreely admit when they are victims...and hopefully holding female attackers \nequally liable.\n\nAs for Watson's brief reference to gender inequality's adverse effect on \nmen, the fact that she didn't list specific sources, studies, or statistics \ndoes not negate the validity of her own direct observations. Like you, I \ngenerally prefer empirical facts, but political speeches regularly cite \nindividual anecdotes to personalize issues.  It's a technique every novice \ndebater learns because most people don't \"connect with\" hard numbers.  For \nthat matter, reciting a litany of ways men are hurt would have strayed from \nthe primary topic of promoting equality in a world where men still \npredominantly control business, politics, and religion.  Certainly the \nspeech was slanted, but you said yourself that it is unheard of for a \nFeminist spokesperson to even acknowledge male victimization, which means \nthis speech is a major step in the right direction.  Take the win.\n\nAs for Top 10 list... Health: Recent medical research has confirmed that \neach gender is more inherently susceptible to certain DIFFERENT illnesses, \na \"discovery\" due to the fact that more women are working in the medical \nprofession than previous generations allowed.  It's not that women's health \nis receiving the lion's share of focus; it's that women's health is finally \nreceiving a more equal share.  Education: ADD & ADHD over-diagnosis \n(particularly of boys) is a modern, LAZY, liability-wary reaction to the \nway Evolution has conditioned juvenile males (of most species) to play and \nlearn...and that reaction is CRAP!!!  Reproductive Rights: Absolutely \nRIGHT, except for one thing.  To claim it's \"perfectly acceptable\" for a \nwoman to have an abortion is a gross misstatement of popular opinion.  Even \nwhere it's legal, abortion still comes with significant social stigma.  As \nfor the perception by the masses that ALL men are inherently rapists and \nabusers, this is the first time I've ever heard such a statement, so the \nperception can't possibly be that widespread, except among man-hating \nFeminist extremists.  Anti-Male Double Standards: Absolutely no argument.  \nIn fact, I'd submit that \"affirmative action\" programs that give \npreferential treatment to women are exactly such an animal.\n\nWhile I agree that corporal punishment is universally over-used, my law \nenforcement experience has consistently demonstrated that \nhomes without REASONABLE physical aversion conditioning (spanking) more \noften produce adults without respect for authority, boundaries, rules, or \nconsequences.  It's true that abuse often begets abuse, but drawing a \ndirect link between adult violence and childhood spanking is like saying, \n\"Most drug addicts were fed milk as children, so milk is a gateway \ndrug.\"  If exposure to corporal punishment created a propensity for adult \nviolence, then your statement that most men have no desire to \nvictimize women would be inaccurate because most men were spanked as \nchildren.  For that matter, since most of the world's women were also \nspanked (or worse) as children, violent crime rates SHOULD be equal for \nboth genders all around the world, BUT THEY AREN'T!  Most of the worlds \nmost productive and peaceful citizens, both male and female, were spanked, \nand they turned out just fine.  To neglect this fact is a disingenuous \ninsult to victims of real violence.\n\nBy the way, it stands to reason that women statistically hit their children \nmore than men because men are usually less involved in raising the \nchildren, including disciplinary action.  It saddens me that someone whose \nresearch I generally respect would present a statistic so out of context.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12cdnggvsand1adj225zx5y5paaxrmz404": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi137N9b7K_SkJwb6Rf0dKQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tony Seyffer", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-18T04:00:42.823Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCi137N9b7K_SkJwb6Rf0dKQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.10248400000000002, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2015-04-18T04:00:42.823Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110026439258207712258", "textDisplay": "All Stefan has to do is put on a pair of glasses and he'll look like \nClarence Bodeker from Robocop..\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13lc1ybvyecezpv523yu1ipvsfhjdz4f04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ7bboLgtSFrjb4bxF7iEZA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--YpmGXhwoN4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADc/9QGCiIybJDo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "John Rambo", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-30T03:25:34.175Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCJ7bboLgtSFrjb4bxF7iEZA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.84048400000000001, "formal_score": 67, "updatedAt": "2014-09-30T03:25:34.175Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106894866831785892663", "textDisplay": "As usual, great work ,Stefan.

Corporations supported the movement and continue to \ntoday because they are greedy. Having the vast majority of homes having two \nworking parents helps drive consumerism and sales. I feel bad for those \nearly women who lost husbands in the wars and had no choice but to leave \nthe home and enter the work force and were fighting for equal pay to \nprovide for her family. Those women had a real cause to fight for - but of \ncourse the radicals get the media coverage and the media will twist it to \nsteer society were they would like to see it go. I am not a feminist or \nanything else for that matter - I have never come across a group, cause, \nreligion etc that I would associate myself with because I do not agree on \nALL the principles they define themselves as or the way the communities \nconduct themselves. All people are so different, living different lives, \nexperiencing different things, with their own inherent nature - which is \ngoing to form their ideas from what they see and their experiences.... It \nis hard for one general group to speak to another general group without \nleaving out, missing or overlooking something that is going to offend or \nnot resonate with someone. \n\nI am not a man so I cannot speak from a males life experience. I did grow \nup with a father that spoke very harshly (and rightly so for the brunt of \nit) of the 70's feminism movement my entire life and continues to today. As \nan adult I listen and have awesome conversations about it with him compared \nto my youth. Based off of what I learned from my father and how the \nfeminism effected him personally - I was happy to hear that she brought men \nup at all and formerly invited them to have a dialogue about it. I am \nsceptical about many campaigns to begin with and that part of it did not \nstrike a chord with me - but I did feel that her heart is in the right \nplace. Let's hope she can be proactive and dig further into male issues. \nShe is young and it does make me wonder if she may not be mature enough \nregarding life experience - but on the other hand it may be better than a \nmore mature woman who has the old mindset. Not that the issue or people are \nthat black and white.\n\nYoutube has allowed me to see an entirely different view of the male \nperspective on feminism. I had only ever heard my fathers. It is \ninteresting and varying. I have seen a lot of people on here feminist \nhating and feminists male hating..... It is hard to take people seriously \nno matter their position when they seem so emotionally unstable when \ntalking of their troubling issues. I like the presentation of this video \nbecause it feels less hateful and more passionate. Passion is what creates \nreal change - hate just gets in the way of change. Try to keep things in \nperspective people and do realize that most of us do want to make the world \nbetter - opposing views can find peace if they put their egos aside.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z125ynoghtjnfthkd231ivrxqzfrcr0ap04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb0vq6zjWguJcmulC7tdSJA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "dynamicwellness33", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T18:52:46.374Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCb0vq6zjWguJcmulC7tdSJA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.090456000000000036, "formal_score": 8, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T18:52:46.374Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110652803757546187257", "textDisplay": "Very good points Stefan, great video as a whole!\n\nI would like to see the reference regarding women doing the majority of \nspanking.\n\nI also think it's important to emphasize that men are responsible for the \nspanking as well.

Where my opinion in the details differs from \nwhat you've said above though is that I do not think that feminism is \ninconsistent with men's rights (though I recognise it is inconsistent with \nthe MRM which if google serves me, is by definition explicitly against \nfeminism). And I also do not think that feminism itself claims to have any \nsole right to fighting gender inequality. Because, absolutely - even though \nsexism cuts both ways and so men would still benefit - since the movement \ntends to have a largely female voice for a female cause, it is likely that \nmany men's issues may not be highlighted. So a 'brother' organisation which \nhighlights men's rights is in my opinion, extremely appropriate. And if \nboth are at the fundamental level movements for equality, then they can \nonly be considered to aid one another, not undercut or work against each \nother. The very idea of women not having agency is an insulting one in this \nsociety because of the level of power women in the western world do have. \nAnd so the burden of responsibility men are upset about is also a \ndiscomfort to women in it's own patronizing way. Imbalance may hurt each \ndifferently but it hurts both all the same. My understanding of the speech \nwas not \"men, you are invited to help women directly, to the exclusion of \nhelping men directly\" but rather, \"men, you are invited to help women \ndirectly because this will help men too\" with the unsaid (I recognise I am \nadding this in, but this is my assumption due to the movement being one \nresting on the pillars of equality), \"and women, you too are invited to \nfight directly for men's rights, because this will help women too\".  So I \nthink the \"help yourself by helping women\" was simply an acknowledgement of \nthe natural side effects of inequality on gendered individuals. And my \nunderstanding of patriarchy being central in feminism is less of a \"men are \nbad\" but a \"we come from a place where power was placed in the hands of \npredominantly males and this has impacted our views, our language and our \nhuman dynamics - let's try and name and deconstruct this given this \nhistory\".\n\nI guess in some ways I am calling for a type of overhaul. But the thing is \nit isn't as dramatic as of feminism itself, because there are many \nfeminists and feminist groups who remain firmly and consistently in the \nidea of equality as the definition of the movement. But I guess I am hoping \nthat when \"feminist\" groups (angry or political propaganda or bought by big \nbusiness/ special interest groups or just plain sexist) do something that \ndoes not adhere to the very definition of equality - then we all stand up \nand call it out it for not being representative of the movement, and thus \nname it as fraudulant and inconsistent. \n\nSo for example (and I hope I don't cause bad blood with this part) - the \nidea that abortion is in line with the view of feminists is one that \nappears to have been influenced and pushed politically through special \ninterests and all sorts of messiness (incidentally primarily by men - not \nthat it matters,  I only mention that to highlight the false advertising). \nThe original feminists were against the idea, and felt it to be a power \nissue whereby the individual (foetus) with lesser power is devalued. So now \nthere are feminist movements naming this and saying - hang on - that's \ninconsistent.\n\nIt has indeed been lovely conversing with you, and refreshing to engage a \ntopic thoughtfully without constant name calling :)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXt6U-23oQR5u21r8KQEx9w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Rae Ealdwine", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z132jljwjxeav13ls22qih2hwkabwfgvz", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-01T14:22:41.826Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXt6U-23oQR5u21r8KQEx9w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.50309000000000004, "formal_score": 12, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-01T14:23:02.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2--fnqCWcqM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjk/corL1DZoKmg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100393063110371519874", "textDisplay": "+Skyturnip This is an example of inequality cutting both ways.

This makes perfect sense if you hold the view \nof the full force of agency belonging to men, but it seems to me that women \nin this day and age have access to agency should they choose to grasp it. \nInstead we have a speech by a supposed spokesperson for feminism (who \nactually didn't even bring up very important women's issues in her speech \nin my opinion), asking men to stand up for women, under the guise of \nhelping themselves. As if signing up for that movement will do away with \nany of men's issues. I have no problem with the campaign, and I find the \nspeech fairly harmless, but disingenuous. I would have much rather \npreferred, \"let's help women\", instead of \"help yourself by helping women\".\n\nOn another note, I find your reasoning sound, regarding the discarding of \ncertain campaigns or groups under feminism as sexist. It sounds though as \nif you are speaking of a complete overhaul of feminism. Since feminism in \nits current form would be totally incompatible with the MRM. I do not \nidentify with either of these groups by the way, although I do not have \nideological problems with the way the MRM describes itself. As I'm sure \nyou've figured out by now my main concern is with the way that fighting the \npatriarchy is instilled into the heart of feminism, and I question the \nnecessity of such a fight, and I wonder what such a fight even means \nanymore, and how it could be undertaken in a meaningful way.\n\nPS. This conversation is probably the longest and most civil I have ever \nbeen a part of on youtube lol. So if I forget about this thread, good day, \nand good talk"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL4L6IB6ToZbJQe2mDnMeFQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "The LostBoys", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z132jljwjxeav13ls22qih2hwkabwfgvz", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-01T07:47:58.433Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCL4L6IB6ToZbJQe2mDnMeFQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.38446000000000002, "formal_score": 85, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-01T07:47:58.433Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-G58g4MbeEBE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAI0/UrJb_Ih4RAM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107703779544483429330", "textDisplay": "+Ray Ealdwine Women use to be the main leaders a long time ago. You can see \nthis in several religions and cultures...it's just not taught anymore. \nMilitarily speaking...it's wiser to move men into powerful positions.\nMen are more cut throat and can stomach making a decision that will cost \nthe life of many. (Pointless murder) \nIf you want to conquer the world...you'll need a man to do the dirty work. \nWomen would be too rational and emotional to do such a task...and \nultimately they would deem war pointless and strive for world peace.\n\nBack in the day...women were leaders because they were naturally smarter \nand matured faster. \n\nThroughout history...women weren't naturally weak, there \npotential/intelligence was suppressed by culture and morals. \n*_*\nWill women continue to gain power. \nThat's hard to tell really.\n\nWomen aren't winning more frequently in family court because they are \nsupposedly better parents, they are winning because it's financially \nbeneficial to the legal system for women to win and men to pay child \nsupport.\nHere in america...If a mother gets $1,000 a month from the father of her \nchild, the american government will pay the state a certain percentage of \nmoney. The mother will still get the full amount of money each month \n($1,000).\nExample.\nGovernment pays state %2.00 of the child support. So the total amount of \nmoney being exchanged is $1,020\nThe extra $20 comes from tax money of course ^_^ \n\nSo as you can see, the court (judge) has a financial incentive to give the \nmother custody and not the father. Naturally men make more money, so it's \nonly logical to target males. \n(I can go into more detail, but that would take to long)\n\nPlus I think it has to do with psychology as well. Men would be more likely \nto refuse to pay child support, which will result in the guy owing back pay \nor going to jail for back pay. \n\nIt also has a psychological impact on children and ultimately the economy \nas a whole.

That's a genuine \nquestion, I'm not being aggressive. This seemed a given to me due to women \nhaving no right to vote, no claim to the throne as a daughter, no allowance \nto work, and men were known as the masters of the households etc. and so \nwomen by nature as not having the education, skill or right to support \nthemselves, became the dependent and less empowered sex. I am not \nsuggesting it is like this today in the western world. But that is where we \nhave come from and so remnants of the system may still be in place (like \ntaking one's husband's surname - language matters, language implies things \nabout power), if not in law, then in narratives and norms. And since time \nhas passed, men's rights issues may also have grown and become very real in \nthis time. There are always people in the world (no matter what they call \nthemselves) who try to overstep the boundaries of the other - and so when \nthis happens, outcry is appropriate.  In some parts of the world the power \ndiscrepancy is still very stark with women having little power. And \nsometimes that is due to them physically having less power/ strength. Am I \nsaying that men are bad abusers? No. I am saying that there are norms are \nnarratives in the world that still use violence as the end point. So \nstronger on weaker, be that male, female, child or animal. I am digressing \nbut my point is only that power dynamics matter. And feminism has been a \nvoice that historically has named the dynamics that hurt women. Now I would \nargue that since feminism is built of the fundamental striving for \nequality, any notion put forth in the name of feminism that does not, \nshould be rejected as part of the movement. And I think this is what emma \nwas trying to do. To reclaim something brave and important. For if we all \nstand up against sexism - through feminism and the MRM, and we name and \nreject that which is sexist and does not adhere to the core principles - \ni.e. if a feminist group is being sexist then they are not a feminist \ngroup. Well then we are taking back something which means a lot, and can do \na lot of good for everyone."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgfv59dqrgubqqszRume4Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "renger6002", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z132jljwjxeav13ls22qih2hwkabwfgvz", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-01T05:22:11.377Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAgfv59dqrgubqqszRume4Q"}, "sentiment_score": 0.03437399999999996, "formal_score": 51, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-01T05:22:11.377Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114208345291419048804", "textDisplay": "+Ray Ealdwine That is a good point and I would agree with you. As I had \nsaid in a different comment, I would be happy to be a part of a HeforShe \nmovement, and have my girlfriend be a part of a SheforHe movement and have \nus all be part of an UsforUs movement. I have no problem with a focus, and \nin fact I believe more people should stop pretending that feminism is an \negaliterian movement and realize that its mandate is to help women. However \nin the current model and with the current tenets of feminism, the movement \nreserves a monopoly on gender justice and equality, and it does this by \nsubscribing to the reasoning of a patriarchy theory which grants all men \nagency and eliminates the agency of all women. As such you cannot have a \n\"SheforHe\", or a \"SheforShe\". So what you get is a movement meant to help \nwomen (which is fine), deciding that it is the only way to help anyone, and \ntherefore is forced to pretend to want to help everyone. In a \nnon-patriarchy theory version of a women's rights movement, you can fight \nfor equality, and you would not be ideologically opposed to having a men's \nrights group alongside you. I hope that clarified my position."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC28UVNtigxGcC1dHPgELJpA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Skyturnip", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z132jljwjxeav13ls22qih2hwkabwfgvz", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-30T14:22:53.028Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC28UVNtigxGcC1dHPgELJpA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.66116200000000003, "formal_score": 27, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-30T14:22:53.028Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Bdxxo5bWt4Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/oZtJDhfq_wo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105745584033903365565", "textDisplay": "+Ray Ealdwine \"something is only feminism if it adheres to the underlying \nfundamentals - equal rights for women.

I think it is very important to have your own thoughts and your \nown brain and to view the world critically, so I understand that different \nopinions being voiced about Emma Watson's Un Speech, is only natural and \nnecessary.\nHowever, the arguments you bring seem both a little bit forced and \nprejudiced. Emma Watson makes it a very important point in her speech, that \nit is not about the word \"feminism\" - it is about the idea that the \ndictionary claims it to be. So even if \"the reality\" shows that a lot of \nfeminist acts are actually anti-men, it still means that the word \n\"feminism\" has the same definition as before - the idea of gender equality. \nAnd this is what she fights for. Gender equality. She is aware that \nman-hating is a reality, and clearly wants to change both that, and the \ngender inequality towards women, which is exactly why she even points it \nout and then continues to define the word. She wants to separate herself \nfrom the unfair man-hating part of feminism.\nYou also show confusion, when the girls leaving their sports teams were \nmentioned, because according to you, \"muscly women\" are displayed as \ndesirable in the media. First of all, this was not always the case. I'm \nonly 21, but, just as an example, I remember my Barbies having no muscle, \nbut (unnatural of course) curves instead. Yes, recently \"fit, toned women\" \nhave been advertised a lot, but this is still the very slender kind of \n\"muscly\". Emma Watson only mentions her girl friends not wanting to be \n\"muscly\". I'm guessing she means the sort of muscles that aren't perfect \nand toned and visible because of almost no fat covering it, but rather the \nkind of muscles that are just gained as a \"side effect\" to exercising, \nwhich aren't toned but just larger and bulkier than normal ones. This is a \nwhole different kind of \"muscly\". Also; if it was their reality that \nappearing \"muscly\" made them feel unwanted and unattractive by other \npeople, it was exactly that. Their reality. Could Emma Watson have \nexplained this with more detail? Probably. Her way of keeping the sentences \nshort and specific, with few powerful adjectives, obviously made the speech \ngripping and interesting and it made a whole lot of people listen.\nYour point on how her message is women NEEDING men to stop gender equality, \nand even that men are always bad and women always the victims is just not \ncorrect. She makes it such a clear point that both men and women face \ngender inequalities that I am surprised you missed it. Not once, does she \nsay that \"only men are bad\" or even that men \"must be involved\". Not once, \ndoes she say that \"women are always the victims\". She doesn't even mention \ndomestic violence, which you bring up on your own. To me, it is obvious \nthat violence, sexual assault and gender inequality is a reality for all \nthe genders. To some people it might not be, so for that reason I can see \nyour point in bringing it up. But exactly this is Emma Watson's point in \nher speech. Let us change ALL gender inequality, which then of course also \nmeans: let us change the perception that only men can be violent to women, \nand never the other way around.\nShe invites men to join the feminist movement, which right now consists of \nmostly women. Her point is that society in general focuses way too much on \nwhat a man should be and what a woman should be. And not at all who's fault \nit is or isn't. I think it is true, that if we invite the men to join the \nvery women-based movement, we would have a lot more success, because as she \nsays, how can we change the world, if only half of it is invited?\nYou also make it a point, that feminists never actually fight for equality \nbut just for women's advantages, and that a \"true\" feminist by definition \nwould fight for, for example men having the same job opportunities as women \nin higher education. First, and most important of all: just because you \nhaven't met one, how do you know they don't exist, and how do you know that \nEmma Watson isn't one? As mentioned before, she clearly states, not being \nof the man-hating kind. Second of all: as with the domestic violence \nsubject: this topic also, is not the real point and essence of this speech \nwhich you are analyzing. Third of all: some jobs and areas are largely \noccupied by men and some are largely occupied by women. They just are.\nYou also mention her choice of voicing the gender inequalities that men \nface, by talking about personal experience. These are examples. It often \nmakes something feel more real when something feels personal. People can \nidentify with Emma Watson's experiences, better than plain statistics. And \nquite frankly, she hits them pretty spot on. As you mentioned yourself, one \nof the biggest problems men have with gender binding roles, is them being \nthe strong, providing, fear-and emotionless one. Which is exactly what she \nmentions. She can't name every single one, as she can't with every single \ninequality issue women face.\nYou keep mentioning mens' rights and that men are pushed to save women from \ninequality. Again. Exactly her point. BOTH men and women experience gender \ninequality.\nYou say, it is obvious she hasn't spent time researching what men want and \nneed. I say it's obvious she has. And while the campaign is called He for \nShe, which is supposed to raise awareness amongst men as well as women, it \nis NOT a campaign directed ONLY to men. Even if she neglected YOUR needs or \nMENS' NEEDS, do we really have to get something to give? Do you have to get \nyour issues solved, before you want to help women's issues. Again, not the \npoint of the speech. Let's try uniting instead. For a man who dislikes \nfeminists who man-hate so much, you seem quite women-hating (or at least \ngeneralizing them A LOT) yourself.\nThe speech very obviously reached a lot of people, and I believe that is \nbecause Emma Watson is a young woman, a lot of people look up to (in my \nopinion for good reason!), who is very talented and kind, and \nwholeheartedly tries her best to make the world a better world for \neveryone. And because she wrote and held a brilliant speech. It was \nrelevant, very relatable, realistic but positive, short but precise and not \nto slow and not too fast.\nAs you felt free to lecture Emma Watson on giving a speech to men, I feel \nfree to say to you: you are doing quite a poor job at appealing to women. \nYou seem condescending, arrogant, presumptuous, you generalize and a lot of \nyour points are, yes very important, but irrelevant to the speech and it's \nmessage.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoqh3Z2GRhHsIiyW8y7mNwQ", "inappropriate_score": 6.4516129032258061, "authorDisplayName": "tim bow", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13uu5gistjxzbh5h04cilxghtb0hvsa450", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-09T14:19:11.682Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoqh3Z2GRhHsIiyW8y7mNwQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.72777200000000009, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-09T14:19:11.682Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116976531715453594179", "textDisplay": "og fuck yourself you overpriveliged bitch, being a man is way harder then \nbeing a woman."}}]}, "z13ocb5wrv3djdlto22sczq4mwzdtnvlc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNYjpoGVWUp7m2cFlCOiamg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ethan Davidson", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-12T10:37:45.367Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNYjpoGVWUp7m2cFlCOiamg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.98738238999999994, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-12T10:37:45.367Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105417129530858663654", "textDisplay": "He just isn't that interesting.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12mdl2i3qj1hz0yb04chxei0xeasx4p1yw0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 7, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC22sVSGwmKUSbAtF117_a9g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AkN04L-q4EE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEI/rpwEMGiNo-k/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.34843205574912894, "authorDisplayName": "Kristi Winters", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-13T10:44:36.992Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC22sVSGwmKUSbAtF117_a9g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.54054000000000002, "formal_score": 51, "updatedAt": "2014-12-13T10:44:36.992Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102879452865018604139", "textDisplay": "I don't see how if a certain group doesn't do well in school it's really a \ngender issue.

My mother, an upper middle \nclass, traditional stay at home mom beat the sh*t out of especially me  \n(the oldest) and my brothers and sisters in the name of punishment. I \nvividly remember standing in front of the mirror with my shirt up and my \npants down in the boys bathroom at school a couple months after starting \n1st grade, looking at the crosshatching of purple welts and broken skin \nfrom the backs of my knees to the backs of my biceps and knowing if anyone, \nespecially a teacher found out, my mom would be in trouble so I kept them \nhidden.  Fast forward three and a half decades. I see my 5 year old nephew \nand it hits me like a thunder bolt: what in the world could this little kid \npossibly do to deserve being beaten like I was at his age? Nothing. Nothing.\n   My mom hit until her anger was spent. My dad was a stern disciplinarian \nbut he gave a prescribed number of whacks with his belt that varied with \nthe severity of the offence. Both styles have left a scar. My mom's by far \nthe worst.\n  A couple hours before she died, my sister video called me with Skype and \nI got to see the barely breathing, totally slack faced mother I had fled \nhome at 16 to get away from, morphined way past unconsciousness and the \nthought \"she can't hurt me anymore\"  unexpectedly roared into my head.\n  I'm 44, 6'-3\",215#, a carpenter/contractor in the snowy North.  I battle \nsnow, rain and cold at work and regularly go winter camping solo for up to \n2 weeks at down to 40 below for fun. I'm not a collage indoctrinated, \nliberal, city dependent softy. Most would describe me as tough, capable, \ncivilized. I look like (and am) a physically big, emotionally tough guy but \nthe beatings and violence, anger I experienced as a kid affect me to this \nday and have shaped who and what I am and who and what I cannot become. I'm \nnot helpless but there are parts of me that my mom's violence damaged \nbeyond repair. It's been like trying to grow a new arm out of an amputated \nstump. It ain't happnin'.\n  I'm not even slightly against disciplining a child, I believe discipline \nis totally necessary and to not discipline would probably be even more \ncruel than beating a child. Even so, don't be lazy and hit them. Ever. Use \nanother form of discipline. The cost to the kid is way too high and long \nlived.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12bwdqrireljrhxc04ce1lgisu2cr0w4hk": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVubhYZd_ZrC9SZ7wJycAig", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "juiweiYang2000", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-13T05:15:21.718Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCVubhYZd_ZrC9SZ7wJycAig"}, "sentiment_score": -0.86153179999999996, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-13T05:15:21.718Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106039033048525842786", "textDisplay": "Emma Watson is too Green.

It sounds as if you are excusing the crimes against \nwomen by bringing into light the crimes against men. I am sure that you did \nnot intend to do so but it certainly sounds like that. The truth is that no \ncrime, committed against men OR women is excused or diminished by a \"worse \ncrime\". All crimes should be punished and considered as such. I agree with \nyou that men are often punished harshly and that there are women excused \nfrom crimes or judged \"softly\" when they should not. We are all HUMAN. \nEverything that we do should count as a HUMAN ACT. Not a woman's act or a \nman's act. A crime is a crime and no one can be excused just because they \nare a woman or a man OR because someone else committed another crime. \nAgain, I agree with you that a lot has to change in the legal approach to \ncrime in general and that false accusations should be perceived and judged \nas a most serious and horrendous crime.\nThe thing is, as I mentioned earlier: your post does not promote equal \nresponsibility either. I get where you're coming from but how can any of \nus, HUMANS, change ANYTHING in this equality matter if we only judge it \nfrom one point of view. How can we \"better\" things if when the subject \ncomes up it all turns into a bloody gender war for 'The most wronged one'. \nAs I read the comments to this video I became more and more confused, \nangered and sad to see that NO kind of understanding was being achieved. I \nsaw only hate, from both men AND women.\nWhat you say about the beating of children and the empowerment of women \ndoes TRULY HAVE to be spoken of. However, you turned to an offensive \nlecture to women. Yes it is true that many many many women spank their \nchildren. It is also true that this is ultimately and irrevocably WRONG. \nYes I agree with you that violence comes from violence and that if you \nperpetrate it then it will spread but you have to see that this is not the \nonly issue. You cannot or should not be seen as an accuser of women to be \nthe only guilty party in perpetrating violence. Sadly your speech gives \nthat impression. \nI want and need to say that I, as a woman, am not on 'the women's side' or \n'the men's side' of this discussion. I decided to write this for you as a \nHUMAN on 'THE HUMAN'S SIDE' because, for me this is the only side that \nshould be taken and so often is not in many more discussions other than the \ngender equality one.\nAs to what concerns the #HeforShe  movement I believe that it as been \nmisunderstood. Emma Watson left out important issues that should have been \nspoken of as you said but she was not trying to drag men into the \n'protector part'. As I understood it, what she was trying to say is that \nthe Feminist movement should be involving men NOT to act as women's \nprotector or to defend them as if they couldn't do it for themselves. I \nbelieve the intension behind #HeforShe  is to INCLUDE men into the fight \nfor gender equality, for COMPLETE gender equality in favor of men and \nwomen, WITHOUT diminishing the injustices committed against both genders in \nfavor of one of them. What stood out for me was that it doesn't treat men \nas the enemy but as a part of the whole that needs to be in sync with the \nother part in order to actually make a better and just change. There are a \nlot of things that need yet to be included into the discussion, yes that is \ntrue, so maybe instead of turning AGAINST one another we could JOIN each \nother to have a more CLEAR AND COMPLETE perspective.\nI hope I didn't seem condemning because that is not my point and should \nnever be anyone's (although condemnation is a part of our human nature it \nis not correct, at least in my eyes, and we should try as much as we can to \navoid it). I needed to write this as a hate free constructive comment which \nI felt was truly needed.\nThere is so much more to be said, I hope that in the future there is room \nto internationally discuss all of it, of what needs to change. This was my \ntry out at understanding and freeing myself of prejudice I hope I achieved \nit.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12qdnaozpu0yzz2o22jedjobszwvdye5": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN8a_bF2vg681Za0SSR1a2A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VrSEK-jmRO0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADg/381q9UdqxEg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Fahrenheit", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T18:39:03.110Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCN8a_bF2vg681Za0SSR1a2A"}, "sentiment_score": 0.80054829999999999, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T18:39:03.110Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108517700113707900261", "textDisplay": "Google International Men's Day, then Google World Toilet Day, look at the \ndates.\n\nThis is what the UN really thinks of men.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13udx5iyurzc12gx04cfdcqutvey1fgylo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 28, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5vhRLlNQ3NHL4tIcouicw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-7H2NMXjXmN8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ4/FKZubuURakY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.6949152542372881, "authorDisplayName": "that tea drinking top hat tipping British man", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-26T15:23:30.486Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCi5vhRLlNQ3NHL4tIcouicw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.37470200000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-06-26T15:23:30.486Z", "likeCount": 74, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116897674466470135783", "textDisplay": "5:07 Emma Watson logic: I need feminism because my friends didn't do what I \nwanted them to do!\n\nNo wonder you were called bossy you fucking insufferable imbecile.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12bexggcqzsz50o304cjxgy0ubdcrri0fc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdTJnfSUvzgsdjQB9RoDzvQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "kittyvalium", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-05T18:16:04.547Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdTJnfSUvzgsdjQB9RoDzvQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.63518000000000008, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-10-05T18:16:04.547Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103065806345983502805", "textDisplay": "So can a feminist please tell me one right males have in america, that \nwomen do not?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13uyv1btujwil30z22jxjn4dnzicnu2h": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 2, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYDa0CG6Yepe792aE1qkUHA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IGnqFOPdoQA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA8/VXrx_QbgE2g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "spinozasp", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-25T15:31:02.529Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYDa0CG6Yepe792aE1qkUHA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.135486, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2015-04-25T15:31:02.529Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112440041582406626368", "textDisplay": "Women are not outstripping men.

I don't think she should shut up, I think she \nshould keep going but did she ask any men to go over the speech and see \nwhat we think about it? She should ask us what we think rather than assume \nwe all think alike. I hate that because men and women both say \"women are \nall emotional and think too much\" and \"men just watch sports and think with \ntheir dick\" I fucking hate that.  i can be just as emotional as a woman and \nbe as much as macho as a man- I don't even care for sports- sometimes I \nthink of a woman as just a sex object to masturbate to, but the woman I \nwant to be with I usually don't even consider having sex with until I get \nto know better- but by then there is some other asshole that has jumped her \nbones and I have to hear about it- so who is the one in chains here?  who \nis really the superior? \nI don't really give a shit who makes more money.. if you worked hard, \nstudied, stuck to your passions you deserve the highest pay grade for your \nindustry man or woman. I've spent 30 years of my life trying to find my \npassion and turn it into a job that makes me rich or at least financially \nstable and in the mean time find someone to love and who loves me but most \nwomen don't give me the time of day.  \n\n I'm all for women's rights, health benefits, reproductive rights, equality \nin the workplace, protection from assault and abuse. It's about personal \nresponsibility- curbing what we say or do in the public or the \ndamsel-in-distress tropes is not productive. urging personal responsibility \nis. I love that Emma Watson is getting involved and speaking her mind even \nif her ideas aren't as well-thought out as perhaps Hermione's would be but \nsometime Hermione can be tenacious and obsessive in her pursuit of \nknowledge or nonhuman and unreasonable, too. But this sounds just like the \nS.P.E.W. her grass roots movement to free house elves who are under cruel \nslavery laws which are ignored because they aren't human.  She thinks that \nwhat the house elves want is what every wizard would want without asking \nthe elves. Sure Dobby was a free elf and flourished but they never talk \nabout Winky in the movies do they- Winky was afraid to change! you can't \nforce people to change- you can only show them a light and use reason and \nask what WE want out of this. If Emma Watson wants me to be a for women's \nrights I will but I don't want to be labeled feminist because they tend to \ndemonize us men as if we all think alike with our dicks. I understand the \nextremists aren't the whole thing but like Christianity - I never wanted to \nbe associated with the fire and brimstone evangelist churches but the more \nliberal less pushy ones may actually be worse because they still perpetuate \nthe belief in unreasonable even supernatural things without considering \nindividual rights, needs, secular morality, or scientific method and they \ndo it with a smile and warm handshake without mentioning Hell or damnation. \nThat is the worst to me. Christians don't ask atheists why we atheists \ndon't believe they just assume we hate god and that we are wrong and want \nto sin. Feminists don't seem to ask men what we think, why we think, how we \nthink women should be treated they just assume that we all want to control \nthem and make them wifey in the kitchen and not go out and be a public \nfigures or doctors or prime minister or president. I'm not like that but I \ndon't think that role of mother or wife who cooks or cleans is a negative \none- it's okay if guys cook, too- some women just aren't good at cooking \nsome men just aren't good at cleaning- as long as there is open dialogue \nand honesty it should be fine. \n\nI see guys with girls all the time. They are usually either assholes that \ncheat on them or they are weak wimps that are controlled and clearly not \nthe pants-wearer or even the bread-winner- which is okay- the woman can \nmake more than the man- and be the provider and the stronger one.  The \nhealthier relationships are the ones where both to be equal though. But \nhere I am- I would be happy with ONE woman - I would never cheat even if I \nhad the opportunity. If I fall in love and spend all my time with you it \nmeans I want to be with you and you will be my whole world. All I do will \nbe for you.

Thank you \nfor that.\nI don't have anything against Emma Watson, really. Her speech sounds deeply \nideological to me, but I grant she might very well be sincere in her \nbeliefs.\nHowever, I also believe feminism promotes unfair and unequal policies while \nscreaming to the four ends of the Earth that it is the only movement that \npromotes equality. I don't know what your beliefs are, but how would it \nsound to you if people started being adamant on the belief that \n\"Christianity is the belief that people must be good to each other; and if \nyou're a good person, then you're Christian\". To me, it doesn't sound very \nhonest.\n\n\nIt's dishonest to promote one's point of view as the only possibility to \nachieve a goal everyone wants... Especially when the real and tangible \nagenda of this group promotes equality only when and how they want.\n\n\nMy problem with Emma Watson is that she is a mouthpiece of feminism, a \nfacade that everyone likes and accepts, and that legitimizes the decisions \nradical feminists impose on society. A few years ago, a law very much like \nVAWA was implemented on my country (a woman may send a man to jail \ninstantly if she accuses him of domestic violence, but the opposite won't \nhappen). Very recently, they expanded this law by increasing the penalty \nfor the murder of women, but retaining the previous penalty for the murder \nof a man. And when you complain against these things, people accuse you of \nhating women... Exactly because society has been trained to bow down to \npeople like Emma Watson.\nIt's disgusting, really.\n\n\nAnyway, that's my beef with these \"false equality\" feminists."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgDRq4D-yZHAc_sG6fNmSZQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "limptastic genesis", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12jvvlwmzndgls5504cepv5claaebiyfd4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-17T02:47:04.358Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgDRq4D-yZHAc_sG6fNmSZQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.54132599999999997, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-17T02:47:04.358Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106383046163319093623", "textDisplay": "I apologize if I came off rude.

She talks about becoming aware of \nbeing sexually objectified from the age of about 14. Perhaps this was \nbecause from about that age she chose to pose for numerous fashion and \n'celeb' photoshoots, often in sexually provocative poses. She obviously \ndidn't need the money, but I'm sure this paid work added to her estimated \n$30 million fortune.\n\n*Emma Watson did not advocate gender equality in 'her' speech to the UN \n(assuming she even wrote the speech which is extremely doubtful), she \nadvocated CHIVALRY which is an aspect of PATRIARCHY.*\n\nShe is the perfect spokeswoman for advocating chivalry because she is \nyoung, slim, weak and fragile looking, attractive and fertile. She \ntherefore has the perfect (biological) attributes to trigger a chivalrous \nreaction in men...... and women for that matter.\n\nShe claims men should be allowed to be weak, vulnerable and sensitive, yet \nin her own life she chose to date a 6'6\" rugby player who is built like a \nbrick shit house. She does not encourage (let alone demand) women start \ntaking on traditionally 'male dominated' roles like garbage collectors, \nconstruction workers, miners, oil rig workers, soldiers, front line police, \nsecurity staff or factory workers - all roles which cause men to suppress \nor compartmentalise their weak, vulnerable and emotional sides just to 'get \nthe job done' (and keep the world running in the process).\n\n*All this feminist 'gender equality' banner waving is just a smokescreen of \npolitically correct jargon to disguise the inherently patriarchal/ \nchivalrous message of the whole 'men servicing women's needs' campaign (and \nof feminism itself).*\n\nThe fact that so many people reacted to the speech in a semi-religious way, \nsaying it made them 'euphoric' and 'on a high' suggests it contained NLP or \nwas at the very least deliberately crafted to trigger extreme levels of \nemotion, sympathy, chivalry, ecstasy, catharsis etc. Whether by accident, \ndesign or just good casting Watson's breathy, infuriatingly slow paced \n(Obama style), demure-yet-assured, nervous delivery certainly seemed to hit \nthe spot (slow paced delivery is a well known hypnotic technique known as \n'pacing and leading'). This extremely positive and euphoric reaction is \nsuspicious considering the speech contained virtually no actual facts or \narguments. I suspect even her outfit was carefully chosen to give this \nalready innocent and fragile young woman the air of a nurse or even an \nangel.\n\nThe very fact that she got to speak to the UN in the first place and that \nher speech got massive media attention - most of it extremely gushing and \npositive - makes a mockery of her (and feminism's) claim that women in the \nwest are oppressed and / or underrepresented. No men's rights advocate is \nable to get within a thousand miles of the UN.\n\nHer 'invitation to men' is portrayed as if it were an attempts to shrug off \nthe man-hating criticisms levelled at feminism, yet it is less on an \n'invitation' and more like the feminist movement instructing men on how \nthey must behave from now on if they want to avoid being shamed, ridiculed, \nsocially ostracised and hated by feminists (with the backing of the media, \ninstitutions and governments which side with feminism).\n\nBasically Emma Watson is telling the world that to be accepted into \nfeminist dominated 21st century politically correct society men must \nsacrifice their manhood, their individuality and their human rights on the \nalter of feminism and work with feminists to promote the feminist agenda \nand the feminist narrative even though it defines men as inherently \n(genetically) all-powerful sociopathic oppressors of women and a threat to \ncivilised society.\n\nIn other words, 'men' are the new 'jews' ... and this 'he for she' campaign \nis like having Hitler telling jews they can 'help themselves' as well as \n'helping Germans' by becoming members of the very nazi party which labels \nthem as a threat to society in the first place!\n\n(The arrogance, insanity and insensitivity/ offensiveness of feminism is \ntruly something to behold. It is classic spoilt brat syndrome, because only \nspoilt brats can have offensive and insensitive views AND NOT EVEN BE AWARE \nOF IT. Modern western women's privilege and special treatment which has \ndetached so many women (thankfully not all) from the real world because \nthey have never had to so much as pick up a shovel or carry a bucket of \nwater is (ironically) the main oppression now faced by these kinds of \nwomen. The materially comfortable, spiritually barren universe of the \nmodern 'sex in the city' woman IS her oppression (her gilded gage). The \nobsession with 'female oppression' might have political motivations higher \nup the food chain, but for the average feminist it is as much about trying \nto regain a sense of AUTHENTICITY as much as anything else. How do you get \nto feel authentic when you are part of a tiny, tiny minority in the world \nable to clip clop about in high heels and avoid all manual labour, get paid \nfor having your picture taken, offload virtually all social/ moral \nresponsibility and generally be a party planner, coffee table gossiper and \nshoe collector?.... you invent oppression so you can pretend to suffer \nalong with with the masses...)\n\nThe old patriarchal style chivalry *praised and rewarded*  (carrot) men who \nsacrificed themselves for women.

XP\n(Numbered based off of the response you gave after a clip of Ms Watson was \nshown)\n\n1. She is saying that this assumption that a feminist is a man hater needs \nto stop. I see where that would be confusing, though.\n2. She was correct in her statement, and not just in definition. The idea \nbehind feminism from the time it originated it for a woman to have equal \nopportunities to those of a male. And as for the education thing, if there \nis not any equality that will ensure men and women have equal opportunities \nand assistance in the field of education, then there should be a rising up \nfor it. If that higher level of education for women was based off of \ninequality and not just women just studying harder with equal opportunity \nand help, something should be done and I think feminists like her would \nhappily support that.\nAnd see that last point you made? That feminism is not actually promoting \nequality between sexes but more privileges for women? That is the thing \nthat Ms Watson is trying to spread awareness of. She is trying to fix the \nissue of feminism being associated with misandry because many feminists are \nactually fighting for male and female equality but won't call themselves \nfeminists due to the image of radicals forced upon them.\n3. LOL where did you pull that from? She is not saying she knows what these \nmale friends were thinking, she just is saying she recognized an emotional \nwithdrawal from them as forced by society so they did not appear weak. You \nclearly must have misheard her. A simple mistake, I assume. Also, it is \nsafe to assume, based on how I observe girls at my school, that her friends \ndropped out of sports teams because they did not wanna be treated like one \nof the guys. I, of course, did not know these specific girls and what they \nfelt, but I am just hypothesizing based on the sports girls who dropped out \nof sports at my school for similar reasons that Watson stated.\n4. Yes, she is implying that is what society does. I like to stand up for \nmyself and be my own person and when I voice my opinion, people call me \nwhiny and bossy until someone with a penis comes in and says I was stating \nmy opinion like everyone else in the room was. LOL WHEN THE FUCK DID SHE \nSAY MEN WERE BAD. You even said seconds before that she was trying to stop \nthe femenazis who threaten to bomb all-male organizations! She did say that \nmen were not allowed to show weakness or emotion and she wanted to change \nthat. You are contradicting yourself dude, please stop. Please stop making \nup things that she never said. You played the video so we could hear it \nourselves, didn't you? Then why are you saying she said things that video \nclip just proved she is not? I love how you even talk about mothers \n\"bashing children\" to prove women are horrible people. I am positive that \nin her fight for gender equality, domestic violence and child abuse *towards \nboth sexes* is an issue she will try to repair. I took interest in your \nwords as a genuine, gender neutral opinion until this point. You clearly \nneed practice in viewing the world with gender neutrality.\n5. I am sure she will ask men what is important to them later. Right now, \nshe is trying to get her point across and get people joining HEforSHE with \na mere 10 minutes of speaking time. She does not have time to ask the men \nright now, which is why she simply listed off examples of mens' issues she \nhopes to work to repair in this fight for gender equality. Listing a ton of \nmens' issues does not prove her wrong, though I do hope her or someone who \nworks for her takes note of these issues in hopes to fix them with \nHEforSHE, something she is implying she wants to help repair. So thank you \nfor making sure to list of things that she needs to focus on with her \norganization. \n6. ...You really rambled and went off topic with this point. Within only a \nfew seconds, you started talking about something totally unrelated to what \nshe said. So, sorry! I therefore cannot give a response to the issue you \nwere confused of because you changed the subject entirely.\n\nI like how YOU are trying to base all of HER opinions and decide that she \nhas never spoken to a men about what they would like. She probably did \nspeak to them. You can say you assume that she spoke to no men, but you are \nspeaking as if you were there in her head from the moment she thought of \ntaking action.  Was she flawed in her statement? Yea, because nobody is \nperfect and she was probably rushing to reduce her speech to fit in to the \namount of time she was given to speak. I am almost positive all the things \nyou stated were left out will be mentioned at a later date. Well, except \nfor idiotic things like her saying men are often told not to show their \nemotions and then you saying she just accused all men of being criminals \nand women innocent...\nUntil then, learn how to view the world with gender neutrality!

Harmony is the goal that everyone must \nachieve, everyone should live with a dream, you can be the ripest fruit, \nand the worms love it I can tell you. It is time for everyone to feel love \nand that no one is to be taking from above.

You heard a \nplea from a damsel in distress who did not deserve help because: 1) she \ncould help herself; 2) some/many women are violent toward children; and 3) \nMs. Watson's examples of how inequality was adversely affecting men did not \nreflect the most important issues for men.  You also heard that Ms. Watson \nwas finished with considering men\u2019s issues thus I heard you imply she was \nboth close minded and ignorant. (Perhaps I heard more than you intended on \nthis last point. If so, forgive me.)\n\nWhat I heard was a woman saying that equal rights for women should be a \nmale issue as well as female and that equal women's rights should benefit \nmen as well as women. I did not hear her assert that the feminist movement \nneeded rescuing by men but that it could use their assistance. What I \nunderstand from your comment is that men would benefit from the help of \nwomen on all the issues you addressed. I did not interpret your comment as \na distress signal from men to women on these issues. I did get the \nimpression you were angered deeply by Ms. Watson\u2019s failure to address these \nissues in this particular speech.\nI did not hear her reject any claim that at times males were disadvantaged \ntoo. I did not hear her mention that she condoned violent feminist tactics \nor violence against children much less the message you received that \nstopping such violence was unimportant to her. While you interpreted her \nsilence on these and other issues as diminishing their importance, I \nunderstood her speech as not about those things.\nWhat I heard was an invitation to work together on female equality. I did \nnot hear a suggestion that this precluded or was intended to preclude \nworking on the issues your comment addresses. I also saw Ms. Watson\u2019s \nspeech as an invitation to work together and engage in dialogue. Again \nperhaps I received a message you did not send but I have the impression \nthat you reject such dialogue unless and until Ms. Watson and other \nfeminists accept your position on these issues. But if that was so, why \npost your comment which implicitly invites dialogue?\nIt is a puzzle.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnP27DCMWOJufPm11uXENFQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tony Midyett", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12uwprbfrb0tn13p23mfnag5nrru1zq404", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-03T11:48:10.099Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnP27DCMWOJufPm11uXENFQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.52771999999999997, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-03T11:48:10.099Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QDX1xUd4ydk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIM/p1FRhy5NJUk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100512602957149199072", "textDisplay": "The right to be treated like an idiot in every sitcom and commercial on TV?"}}]}, "z12qyvyw1ke3ztkj004chlhjgtubznwbgpc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4PMOChElwmxzCXKsUvGLWQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kLBdcII8-2U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKc/4xN2XvIUFoA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.098901098901099, "authorDisplayName": "Captain Freedom", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-04T13:47:41.622Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4PMOChElwmxzCXKsUvGLWQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.68655200000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-04T13:47:41.622Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111118114040015953833", "textDisplay": "But feminists are still people and people are by and large intellectually \nlazy and dishonest.

They don't understand the efficacy of a time out or a \ntalking to: sometimes you need to enforce a lesson with a spanking. \n\n 'Spanking lowers children's I.Q.'s!' I disagree: when a child has been \nsubject to correctional violence by a loving and benign caregiver, he is \nlearning legitimately the effects of his or her dysfunctional behavior: \npain. This makes him or her, in my opinion, LESS violent in adulthood, \nbecause the child knows the consequences of failing to communicate and \nbehave properly in human society. \n\n An adult that understands there are no exceptions to the jungle law of \n'don't hit people because they hit back' is more likely to reason and \nrationalize rather than haphazardly attack or abuse someone. In my honest \nopinion. Comparatively, women are spoiled in this regard, because physical \nretribution for bad behavior isn't even a plausible response. How much of \nan asshole would you be if you knew it was socially reprehensible for \nanyone to hurt you, you specifically? I contend it would be taxing not to \nluxuriate in that kind of maniacal classicism. \n\n I was disciplined as a child and I am, principally, a very rational and \npacifistic person.

I think you missed the angle she was going for. \nculturally imposed gender expectations exist for both men and woman, and \nfor wildly different qualities. Imagine the culturally imposed belief that \nyou have to be a protector and a provider. That you can not show weakness, \nor ask for help. That you can not lose,or be inferior in any way without \nbeing shown as less of a man. Your ego is literally always on the line when \nyou try to play by the societal norms of being a male. I vividly, VIVIDLY \nremember gender expectations dictating what I would like as a kid.\n\nFor a simple example, dance. Ballet. I went to an art school for a lot of \nelementary and high school and I can tell you with ferocity, that no male \nin my grade was allowed to express genuine interest in dance. Even if they \nhad that interest, it was not something you could act on.\n\nBut what if you didn't know whether or not you liked dance yet? What if \nthat gender expectation prevented a large number of us from ever \nexperiencing something we would have genuinely enjoyed or even excelled at? \nLarge swaths of male futures are stamped out because it is not acceptable \nbehavior for a typical male.\n\nThis was what I took away from this particular section of this speech. It \nwas refreshing to hear a female feminist say that men, too, are victims of \ngender expectations that prevent us from doing things. It even prevents us \nfrom admitting we are victims too. You know, the ego would really take a \nshot if it found out if we were victims of just about anything.\n\nThose Gender expectations are wreaking havoc on young boys and girls. And \nthey are causing MUCH of the actual conflict over sexism, or over \nfeminism\\Men's Rights activists. Just like the economic expectations, and \ntradition expectations are.\n\nThat's why i liked this speech overall. The over arching theme I gleaned \nfrom it was that woman who are angry at men are failing to realize that \ngenuine empathy means you have to understand your opposition. And in this \ncase, your opposition is a victim of the exact same problems they are. \nAwesomely, another article came out in the same week, with the same over \narching message (\nhttp://ideas.ted.com/2014/09/18/whats-it-like-to-be-a-woman-in-competitive-gaming-a-female-gamer-explains/\n).\n\nFeminists that lack empathy toward the culturally imposed gender \nexpectations of men are just as much of a problem as anything, because men \nare victims of the exact same thing. Only they don't understand it because \nthey genuinely believe they will truly dislike feminine stuff. Imagine how \nthis type of societal or even sexually imposed frustration might play out \nin the life of one of these guys that go awol with a gun.\n\nIt's just nice to see these feminist talks take a new direction. One that \nis aimed at understanding, and not conflict.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z132zrdqynfgzf3lv22yxrazclqqvtmbd04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOi-2k1ulbnEiJe6XNJBKyg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZiAyCscDW3U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEM/8XQjogaFBEY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Billy Cosmosis", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-08T15:16:35.482Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOi-2k1ulbnEiJe6XNJBKyg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.50988000000000011, "formal_score": 83, "updatedAt": "2015-09-08T15:23:24.000Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118237503646406147638", "textDisplay": "Jesus Christ!

Who said men have to be \"vulnerable\" and \"weak\" if \nthey want to? Wtf?\u201d I said, \u201cThe point is not to be weak, the point is to \nbe able to be anything you want to be\u201d \n\nYou then went on to give your justification as to why Emma Watson is unable \nto be a spokesperson for UN women \u201c1%er of women with amazing looks, money, \nfame and respect\u201d which would in essence leave her unable to comprehend \ninequality. \n\nYou then try to disprove my mention of conscription as something men want \nto chance with the justification that it is necessary in militarized \nnations like South Korea. You also state that Emma Watson cannot speak for \nmen with penises, and that if a man were to suggest what she had suggested \n(ie. To assist in men\u2019s rights issues and social change) then there would \nbe outrage. \n\n\nTo your comments I reiterated that your statement in fact proves that she \nwas a good spokesperson as she is being heard because of her 1%er, amazing \nlooking status. \u201cyou are saying that yes, you watched her because of who \nshe is\u201d. Meaning she achieved exactly what she was intended to, which was \nattention to the issue. \n\nI then went on to comment that you are suggesting contradictory facts. You \nsuggest that the world is the way it is for a reason and should remain the \nsame. But you also argue that Women can not know men\u2019s rights issues and \ntherefore should not suggest discussing them. You try to use the point of \n\u201cif men did it\u201d. I honestly do not agree, there are a number of women \ncurrently involved in men\u2019s activism who have taken up their battles just \nas there are men fighting for women\u2019s rights. I did state that this was a \nconfusing statement by you. I stated: \u201cMen should speak to women, just as \nwomen should speak to men. Hence social change, aka all of society\u201d (this \nis indicative of both having social rights issues) \n\nYou disregard my comments then on the grounds that they \u201ccan not, and do \nnot exist\u201d as proven by the use of Emma Watson and not an \u201caverage women\u201d. \nIn your opinion she does not possess the qualities necessary for the role \nas spokesperson for the UN women\u2019s group. You then go on to not state what \nqualities a spokesperson should in fact have in your opinion. \nYou then go on to describe the \u201cextremist side\u201d. You state that you had \nprevious meant that there should be a male and female speaker and that both \nshould not speak for one another. You also amount my confusion to not \nhaving read you original post as you intended it to be read. \nYou suggest that this speech was telling men to be emotional when it \u201cis \njust stupid in a biological point of view - estrogen and testosterone \nbalance is the key factor in how women and men comport themselves in AND \nout of society\u201d, and then go onto state that: \u201cMs Watson also says men \n\"need to be strong\", and more or less says women can't do this without \nmen\u201d. And you ask if this is ok to me. \n\nYou state that men listening to women would mean: \"Men need to give up more \nsocial rights and comforts in favor of women, 'for equality' \". You also \nstate that women do not fight against male inequality. \u201cDon't bother trying \nto claim the opposite, do a search on google\u201d. You insinuate the \nridiculousness of this movement and suggest that is because it is being \nbased in developed countries where women have more \u201cfemale-friendly \nprograms, societies, and education\u201d. Then you ask if I think it is ok for \nher to speak and think for a man. And finally you slip in, women \u201chave more \nrights than men\u201d. \n\nYou make a second comment about the biological difference of men and women \nand use the fact as support for inequality of men and women. (you throw in \nyour opinions on what you would support of women\u2019s issues, and point to the \nlie that is pay inequality) You suggest that separating sexism from \nequality issues in order to achieve equality (which you previously stated \ncould not exist) \n\nI first commented by stating that no one has argued the biological \ndifference of men and women. In essence I give my argument for why equality \nhas never existed between genders. (not sexes). I state why gender norms \nand inequalities are harmful to men and women and present in western \nsociety in my example of the LGBTQ community. I then mention my argument \nabout the parental role and how it is oppressive to men and women. Again I \nstate that social change can not take place without all of society. I also \nstress that this is an international ideal. (UN) \nYou then make a comment saying that I stated that biological difference is \na misconception. (I did not, I said you point was your misconception of the \nargument. Biological difference is fact.) You then go on to say how I \nassumed Watsons main argument was parenting roles (it was not, it was the \nmain argument of the video on which you are arguing.)  You then go on to \nstate that men in fact face more issues\u2026(as I previously mentioned) and \nthen go on to not name any others but to insinuate that I learned my facts \nfrom Ms Watson (which is not true... as would be obvious if you listened to \nher speech in its entirety) \nYou then say \u201cAlso, just because both women and men are 'arguing for the \nsame parenting issue' DOES NOT mean they have the same perspective or even \nthe same damn issue...\u201d (I did not say they had the same perspective..I \nsaid they had the same issue\u2026.because they do) Instead of providing any \nmore support for your argument you instead choose to restate my quote of \n\u201cmotherhood oppression\u201d and make no comment on it. (maybe you could have \ntried google as you keep suggesting to me) \nSo I go onto explain myself again to you as I inserted in comments above. I \nalso stress that \u201cstating one men\u2019s argument (although I mentioned more \nthan one) does not insinuate that no other issues exist.\u201d As you seemed to \nthink that was a point I was making. I then point to the credibility of my \ncommentary as you seem to question my referencing as opposed to disproving \nmy points. Instead of outlining the obvious nature of motherhood oppression \nI suggested you look at it from a fathers perspective to try and get you to \nactually think. If one party is arguing they have no responsibility the \nother would obviously argue the fact that they are left with it all. (as \nyou seem to not understand that) \nSo this was in response to your final post where in which you accuse me of \nnot speaking to your original point (ignoring the points I had previously \nmade) and that my points do not make sense (so I tried to simplify them for \nyou). You ignore the question, as you ignored the statement. Then you \nproceed to prove the \u201cnature\u201d or paternal unfair treatment. You suggest \nthat it was and remains woman\u2019s decision to maintain all child rearing \nresponsibility. You state that the fathers, or men, have and had no say in \nthe matter and have therefore been victims of unfair treatment in the case \nof parenting. \n\nSo now I will respond to your comment. \n\nIn terms of modern parenting I suggest you \u201cgoogle\u201d or even better, read \nany academic material on the history of the parenting roles. You will find \nthat traditionally it was not the mother\u2019s responsibility but that of the \ncommunity. Modern western parenting ideals were actually introduced post \nWW2 by a male philosopher. You may have hear of Rousseau? In essence his \nfindings suggested that women had to remain home with their child, \nbreastfeed, and be in constant care of their child or else he or she would \nwind up being a criminal. (to simplify for you) To broaden the picture, at \nthis time women manned the jobs the men previously had and were resistant \nto leaving them come the wars end. This book suddenly became the number one \nparenting book and all middle/upper class women suddenly became stay at \nhome moms again with new restrictions concerning how they must preform \ntheir motherly duties. The point I am making, is that the \u201cidea\u201d of the \nparental role as it stands, is that of a man. Which disproves your point in \nits entirely leaving space for there to be an argument for equality \nconcerning parental roles. \nIn every argument I have made I support the notion of male and female \noppression. In every argument I have made concrete examples of both male \nand female human rigth\u2019s issues. So no, I am obviously not ignorant to the \nfact that oppression goes both ways. Obviously. \nAs you seem to deem my lack of response problematic in some way..or maybe \nyou found the fact that I supported the fact that you finally state that \nmen and women both currently feel oppression. Whatever the case, I hope \nthis clarifies and satisfies you. As for your need to connect the current \ndiscussion to your original argument; I disproved that with my first \ncomment. She was not insinuating \u201cspeaking\u201d or \u201cthinking for men\u201d as you \nsuggest. She suggested a dialogue as we just exchanged. Your opinion \nconcerning her inability to speak for women due to her stature is a petty \none at best. She is not the founder of this movement. UN women are. She is \nthe spokesperson. She is not the head of this movement, she is meant to \ndraw attention to the issues and act as speaker for something she cares \nabout. I would say that she has been incredibly effective in being such. \nHave you even looked at the additional speakers both male and female that \nhave the same job she does? There are more. The fact is, you just chose to \nlisten to her as she is the one who had the media coverage and subsequent \nfollowing due to her stature. \nSo, was it really a bad idea to have her as a speaker? You have your \nopinion, and I keep mine. I simply implied that your argument against what \nshe said (although she in fact did not say what you stated she did: \u201cAnd \nhow does she know what men innately need or need to do to change? Who said \nmen have to be \"vulnerable\" and \"weak\" if they want to? Wtf?\u201d) \nSo, any more comments or questions on things you need clarified?

So \nin this day and age, what is considered acceptable have always been up to \nthe WOMAN. Note the caps is to emphasize the semantics, not to imply \nanything sexist.

Are you trying to support \"equal responsibility\" or are \nyou simply ignorant to the fact that oppression goes both ways?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkja8UJkD84mMazm3DVx9Rg", "inappropriate_score": 0.17094017094017094, "authorDisplayName": "Kristin M", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13zwvtifxiojlzvz22ti3cgoy3zstmka", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-12T00:19:08.825Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkja8UJkD84mMazm3DVx9Rg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.639594, "formal_score": 87, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-01-12T00:19:08.825Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-T0bZyJ_HM9o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACg/T2GkxpA3TII/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102410231953860453012", "textDisplay": "My argument was that men and women ARE biologically different.

No one, \nno feminist (with the exception of some less educated \"radicalists\" with \nselfish and personal objectives) is arguing for male and female equal \nidentities. No one is or has argued that men and women can or should be the \nsame in physicality. We are biologically different and that can not be \ndisputed. Which is why it is not being disputed. \n\nWhat is being disputed is the equal access to human rights, and it is \nunarguable that women are intact human. (despite historical attempts to \nprove otherwise). Here is the fact: This is an international argument. Many \nwomen are still disgustingly oppressed in the world. That can not be \nargued. Now, for western society, it is different, due to the advancements \npreviously made in this area. That being said, Gender equality has never \nexisted in respect, or access to human rights. Gender being the social \nconstruction of what constitutes being male or female excluding biology. We \ncan see numerous examples (most vividly in the US) of specifically male \ngender discrimination. I am referencing the LGBTQ community who has long \nfelt the oppression associated with the rigid gender norms that exist in \nout culture. The same is said for women as well as men who assosictate as \nheterosexual as mildly mentioned by Watson. \n\nA perfect example is actually mentioned in this video. The #1 Male social \nrights issue currently in what I am assuming is the US is the father role. \nThat being, the diminished parenting role and notion of incompetence \nassociated with modern intensive and female centric parenting. This is a \nperfect example because it is currently the #1 issue being argued by \nfeminist scholars. Modern motherhood is the most oppressive gender role \nexpectation on women currently. So now we have two sexes, arguing that the \nsocial construction of parenthood associated with their gender is the most \nimportant social rights issue to them, and neither side prior to Watsons \nspeech has ever considered coming together to even discuss the notion of \nsimilarities. \n\nThe point is, Watson's notion of incorporating male's into a previously \nfemale exclusive discussion may not be the perfect solution. The point is, \nit is a start, and it is a start towards something that is necessary for \nboth sexes. Ive stated before. Social change cannot happen with only half \nof society. That goes both ways.

Your question doesn't make sense because the entire premise of my OP \n(the one you questioned initially) is the fact that they have a person who \nis certainly much more than just an average woman be the speaker. Your \nquestion cannot, and does not exist, because the UN does not just go and \npluck a random, ordinary woman off the street. The speaker should possess \ncertain qualities. Qualities that can be appealing if you want to send a \ncertain message over live television. What qualities these things are I'll \nleave up to you to decide. But it isn't very hard to figure out.\n\n2. And here reveals the extremist side. So by suggesting that there be a \nfemale and male speaker, and by suggesting that either gender do not \nattempt to speak for one another, I am saying women should listen to men? \nWhat the fuck are you on?\n\nYou need to just step back, as an individual (in case you assume I'm trying \nto give orders to a woman), and READ the post you are trying to argue. You \nyourself have admitted how confused you are, undoubtedly you read a few \nsentences and then decided against finishing it because there is \nobjectively nothing in that post that is sexist, or difficult to understand.\n\nWhat her argument may have been holds nothing to the fact that she was \nundoubtedly telling men that men are in denial, and that apparently men \nhave to have all these emotions (which is just stupid in a biological point \nof view - estrogen and testosterone balance is the key factor in how women \nand men comport themselves in AND out of society, not \"the patriarchy\" or \nsome shit)\nMs Watson also says men \"need to be strong\", and more or less says women \ncan't do this without men, which is WAAAAAY more sexist that anything I \nhave written. This part is somehow ok to you?\n\n\"Men listening to women\" (whatever the hell that even means) in order for \nwomen to achieve equality is actually a nice way of saying \"Men need to \ngive up more social rights and comforts in favor of women, 'for equality' \n\". I know this is true because in cases of inequality that favors women, \nliterally nothing is being done by any women at all to help achieve \nequality. Don't bother trying to claim  the opposite, do a search on google \n(bet you never even imagined such a concept of sexism going both ways LOL). \nBut hey, I was raised to respect women whether they themselves act like a \nbitch or a lover. This political bullshit pisses me off, and I WILL have a \nproblem with people who get caught up in useless movements. It is \nRIDICULOUS how feminism is most prominent in the most developed countries \nlike UN members, where there are more female-friendly programs, societies \nand education systems that would make a man's jaw drop. So I ask you, one \nlast time, with even a \"please\", to not think it is right, as a woman, to \nassume she can speak, or think for a man. And no, it doesn't work the other \nway either. How much more do you actually need men to listen btw? When you \nhave more rights than men?

Because they're not really for equality, that's \na pretty slogan only.\n\nMore on that opinion;\nThe official title of North Korea is The Democratic People's Republic of \nKorea, and according to its website it's the bestest, and happiest place \nthere's ever been on Earth, but you and I both know its own definition is \nworthless.

We can date and even have \nlong term relationships but we won't marry. Most of us won't move in with \na woman and we certainly won't have kids with a western woman. All of those \nthings \ngive a woman too much power over us. If the power and legal obligations \nwere \nequal between men and women things would be different but under these \nconditions, \nwe have to be extremely careful of women. MGTOW is an adaptation men are \nmaking \nto a legal environment that's extremely hostile to men. When a man and a \nwoman are \nbattling in court, the woman has a massive advantage. And when a man finds \nhimself \nin family court he is going to be pretty much destroyed financially. I know \na guy \nwho keeps having his checking account \"hit\" by the family court, years \nafter his \ndivorce was final. Moving in with a woman is also dangerous \n(especially if she has a kid) If she can dig up a receipt where you bought \nsomething \nfor her kid you can suddenly find yourself paying child support to her for \nher \nkid because the kid \"thinks of you as it's father\". And of course if she \ngets pregnant, \nmost likely to trap you into a marriage, she's got you on the hook for 20 \nyears or \nso of child support. So we rarely move in with women and we take extreme \ncare not \nto be trapped into involuntary parenthood.\nMen exist as legal inferiors compared to women. If a woman gets pregnant, \nthe man \nis fully subservient to the choice the woman makes. The woman can take the \nmorning after pill, abort, adopt, or even drop the baby off at a fire \nstation. \nShe can end her parenthood obligations any time she wants. You however \nhave no such right. You must comply with her choice and if she wants the \nkid you \nhave to pay and pay for a couple decades or even more if the kid decides to \nattend college. And if you don't or if you can't pay for some reason, \nthe family court judge will throw you in jail. And in such situations you \ndon't \neven get an appointed attorney because family court is supposed to be \na civil matter (never mind the jail time). And if you refuse to go to \ncourt, \nthe police will show up at your door to kidnap you. And if you resist, \nthey will kill you. All this places women in a position of legally superior \npower \nthat's so great that she can enslave you. That's why MGTOW are very careful \nwith \ntheir sperm. A man's sperm is valueless to him but if a woman gets a hold \nof it, \nshe can use it to turn you into a financial slave for 20 years. \nGuard your sperm my friends.\nAs far as whether or not to become a MGTOW goes, \neach man has to decide that for himself though.?\n\n  Men become MGTOW because of the risks involved with relationships and the \ndesire not to \nbecome slave to a system that views men as productivity machines and \nnothing more.  \nMGTOW also understand the nature of women considering things like \nBriffault's Law and hypergamy.  \nSure, the purple squirrel 1 in a million NAWALT may exist, but even then \nher being that \nway doesn't reduce the risk men have in relationships.\nThe risks aren't just confined to family law that puts men at extreme \ndisadvantage and \nin a position for financial and social ruin, or even prison, homelessness, \nand suicide.  \nMen are also at risk for false assault and rape allegations that put them \nin a position \nunique to the legal world in having to prove their innocence.  With rape \nshield laws, \nhe is presumed guilty with his name now public and his reputation pretty \nmuch permanently ruined.\nMGTOWs recognize these things and choose not to put themselves at risk.  \nThey also choose not to become involved in a socially disadvantaged \nposition \nthat treats them as nothing more than uitilities, ATMs, and if necessary, \ndisposable.\nHow many women will date a guy who \nmakes less than she does?  A few may, but they \nwouldn't be serious about them.  An internet search on \"Would you date a \nguy if he \nmakes less than you\" and \"Would you date a man who doesn't pay for the \ndate\" will reveal\n how open and unabashed women's opinions are on these things.\nIn relationships, men are nearly always expected to put themselves and \ntheir \nlives on the back burner, including their hobbies, interests, friends, and \neven family, \nfor that of the woman's.  I have yet to see an exception to this.  While \nsome reduced \ntime in these things is expected when a man is suddenly spending more of \nhis free time \nwith a woman, it doesn't stop there.  Most men live lives of quiet \ndesperation in marriages \nand relationships, that gleam in his eyes gone and any hopes and dreams he \nhad vanished.\n\nOnce you accept that women are chattel assets of the state you realize that \nin fact they \ndon't exist they are not people they are leasehold property of the state.\nLet Obama/Cameron buyout general matrimony the same way they bought out \ngeneral motors, etc. \nWomen are state prostitutes for the entitled feminist, bureaucratic and \nlegal class giving \nthem access to remove any wealth you produce.\nThe feminist bureaucratic pimps just put women back on the street to turn\nanother marriage/co-habitation-divorce trick. The Central banking \ncartel/crime-syndicate \nmust be running out of funds.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ux13oowqnif4zf04cizs5puq0gbrjlao": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChF-saYmfTJGLfm5f2HzeDw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mitchell Greatrix", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-01T00:08:14.309Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UChF-saYmfTJGLfm5f2HzeDw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.068827999999999945, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-01T00:08:14.309Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117729413699519818184", "textDisplay": "Stefan Molyneux have you ever thought about interviewing Serj Tankian on \nany kinda topic at all? im sure it would be a fascinating segment \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12jjbfbdoyucrkm323qitt40qehznk3n": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwYKzRuTthhaacpIE58nsPA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_d4zusYq3sY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFY/XAprKQQUCiI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 6.666666666666667, "authorDisplayName": "MULTIVITAMIN670", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-01T10:56:02.231Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwYKzRuTthhaacpIE58nsPA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.93322830000000001, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-10-01T10:56:02.231Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107540840697552845666", "textDisplay": "Windgardium Leviosa, Hermione is a self grandiose bitch.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13iwt3azkjetdpdv22xxljilmmkc1vl0": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBM3frFl5kwRV71QlGiM_g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q_il1nwCq3I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/sczoGDxw8Js/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "zeldasaver", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-03T22:20:01.632Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwBM3frFl5kwRV71QlGiM_g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8066004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-03T22:20:01.632Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109172789624695242737", "textDisplay": "All debate aside, does anyone else think he's got the best low-register \nspeaking voice?

Women stay in abusive relationships they \nhave the ability to get out -- with therapy or what no. Its the individuals \nresponsibility to seek help, we don't need a movement for that IMO. From my \nlimited knowledge of abusive men, I have noticed that it comes from issues \nof self- confidence and a feeling of powerlessness because of this -- this \ncan be because of many different reasons. I'm certainly not excusing their \nbehavior. My father beat my mother and she called the police on him. When \nthe issues came to a head she divorced him. In my father's case, it was \nsevere childhood trauma, but I know that's not always the case. I think we \nneed more grassroots and networking and less publicity stunts and \ncampaigns. Women are hostile to each other and spread negativity, so I \ndon't think they're doing enough to be able to say that there's really some \nunconquerable enemy out there.

What i said was in answer to the previous \nfeminists distorted view on reality that women are poorer than men. This is \njust incorrect in every country in the world. Even in third world countries \nthere are just as much poor men as there are women. There is no evidence \nthat women are poorer than men. If anything it is men who are poorer even \nin poorer countries because they can not seek assistance from organisations \nor the government as they tend to assist women first and men are left to \ndefend for themselves.\n\nWhat is the minority world? there is no such thing. How is what i said \nabout education sexist? Rich women often had private tutors who taught them \nanything they wanted to know. Your view of history is taint through \nfeminist glasses, you think that women had no education while men did is \njust not true. There was just as many poor men in history that had no \neducation and could not read or write through their entire lives. This is a \nsymptom of poverty not of patriarchy. By the time education became more \naffordable both men and women benefited from it. It was just the culture at \nthe time that led women to choosing to not study further and become a \nmother instead. They were not forced to become mothers by some evil \npatriarchy. There were many women working in skilled jobs in history at a \ntime when they were meant to be prevented from working due to the \npatriarchy. Learn some history that is not written by a feminist.\n\nYou did not just make the argument that in war women receive more violence? \nThat is ridiculous. Male deaths from war far outnumber women deaths \nobviously. To even think that women receive more violence in a peaceful \ncountry or during a war stricken country you would have to be completely \nbiased. Men are victims of violence throughout their lives several times \nthe amount of women on average. What men on men violence is not relevant? I \nam not surprised that you would say that with your feminist tinted glasses \nthat you see the world through.\n\nMen die early than women and always have. They still do all the dangerous \njobs. Women do not want to do dangerous jobs.  There may be a few \nexceptions but the majority of dangerous jobs are still done by men and \neven after a century of feminism in the west we still see men doing all the \ndangerous jobs.\n\nYou have not even put a coherent argument together. Motherhood is \noppressive? are you serious? That is a biological necessity for the \ncontinuation of the human race, how can it be oppressive? Women have always \ncontrolled men through sexuality and maternity and they continue to do so. \nIf anyone is a victim it is men not women."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkja8UJkD84mMazm3DVx9Rg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kristin M", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13wvrgyqnjuetkjv04cdbtjsye3g5iie3k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-03T07:36:49.367Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkja8UJkD84mMazm3DVx9Rg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.37630800000000003, "formal_score": 81, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-12-03T07:36:49.367Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-T0bZyJ_HM9o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACg/T2GkxpA3TII/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102410231953860453012", "textDisplay": "+Gregory Van Der Mewve\n1. your wealth scale is only correct in western society\n2.

They talk dishonestly about \"equality\" (because it's a \nnoble-sounding and slightly meaningless word, very useful for politicians \ntrying to get people behind them) when in fact they don't care about \nequality at all - except where it suits them.\n\nFeminism just seems to be little more than a general movement to get women \nsticking together for each other, and not minding if it's at the expense of \nmen. Not only that, but it encourages a good deal of resentment and \nhostility towards men (from both sexes)\n\nI have 2 constructive criticisms: many MRAs want their words to be positive \nrather than just negative about someone else's movement, and so they say \nthey are for equality. The problem with this is that equality - once again \n- SOUNDS wonderful, but is unrealistic, unachievable and frankly \nmeaningless. Equality of opportunity meant a bit more, although it's not \nwithout it's own philosophical issues, but nowhere near as many as this \ndisastrous flag-waving for \"equality\"\n\nSecondly, Stefan needs to speak more from the heart. When he says \"I'm a \nlittle confused by this\" we all know (EVERYONE does) that he's not so much \nconfused as deeply cynical of the motives - however rightly.\n\nIt would be more honest to say: \"Look I wish I believed these people, but I \ndon't. Yes I've been hurt by life, and I think feminism has contributed to \nthat - it's divisive\" or whatever.\n\nDo you see the difference? Mock puzzlement makes for amusing writing \nsometimes, but to do it in a convincing video you need to be a good actor & \nperformer. Ms Watson is evidently not too bad at that side of things (it \nwas quite a performance actually), although she wouldn't know a logical \nargument if it was right infront of her pretty nose. SM is better at this \nside, but needs to work on his acting, or speak straight from the heart. \nPresentation is crucial - which is why feminists put it before content and \ncogency.\n\nGood luck\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z134cz5yatunyzr0s22zi33ovl3fjpxqf04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCelhXVsHS56e4rn2gf1R5sw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-U3co82EWqCs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC88/2aRgnHQDTbE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Tomasz Sterna", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T13:57:28.724Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCelhXVsHS56e4rn2gf1R5sw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.89342750000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T13:57:28.724Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100061802999835721670", "textDisplay": "Emma Watson\u2019s UN Speech: What She Didn\u2019t Say #HeForShe\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13kf3uayuemetstr22xf3lyeqrzwdpwj04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3pOjBLK3JMr4xbiEUvD27A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-e4G8Vo-k_ZM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/nCSFPAyZPz4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Just Jasmine", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-30T03:53:24.068Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3pOjBLK3JMr4xbiEUvD27A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.085396000000000027, "formal_score": 67, "updatedAt": "2014-09-30T03:53:24.068Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105261254249580430261", "textDisplay": "Though I don't agree with everything you've said, I do agree with your \nprimary message of personal responsibility.

It is \nalso not supported by the evidence. \nShe also uses nebulous terminology in an attempt to avoid being critiqued. \nFor example, she tries to claim that biological differences create benefits \n[in modern society] for men. \nThe problem here is that if anything the complete reverse is true. \nThe ultimate measure of all these topics is life expectancy.\nIn all the time that we have had statistics on this I understand that there \nhas only ever been one country where life expectancy of males was higher \nthan for females. (There was some epidemic). I am researching now and on \n2013 data I can't even find a single country where life expectancy of males \nis higher than females. Not one.\n\nShe tries to side step this by saying \" benefit of men as a power figure\". \nShe never explains what she means by this or what relevance it has to \nanything at all. \nFor example, the Prime Minister of Sweden is a man. However Sweden is an \nextremely feminist country. No one can possibly claim that men have special \nbenefits in Sweden.\n\nAsk her if her theory works both ways or if it falls down once we switch \ngenders. For example the President of Brazil is a woman. \nSo does it follow then, that women have special benefits in Brazil because \ntheir leader is a woman?\n\nAs you can see the entire theory is obviously nonsense. She tries to \nobscure that by being nebulous and using innuendo instead of logic.\nIn fact she is relying on men'd instinct to protect women so that men will \nnod along rather than try to really understand what she is claiming. Hence \nwe might argue she is illustrating the exact opposite of what she is \nclaiming.\n\nIn fact for decades men just noded and allowed feminists to carry on with \nevery more absurd claims. Unfortunately this did more and more damage to \nsociety. Now men and women are calling feminists out for their pernicious \nhypocrisy. And feminists do not like it one bit.

Maybe you might want to watch daytime TV sometime, read a \nwomen's magazine, listen to women's conversations, you know like everyone \nelse does and knows this is the very basis of our culture now after 50 \nyears of Feminism and the divorce court system transformed into a \ncompletely corrupt instrument for profit that women use to exploit men.\n\n*It's a billion dollar a year industry!* And the courts get a percentage. \nFamous actresses go on TV and claim children don't need fathers and in \nevery divorce story in the news, men are mocked and laughed at when they \nare ass raped in court by their wives. And everyone says they 'deserved' \nit, yet no one ever says why or how they came to that conclusion (???)\n\nWe live in an extremely bizarre, sick, twisted and perverse society where \nwomen are completely abusive and use the legal system as a giant stick to \nshake down men.

All women \nhave one goal; to make men's lives a living Hell on Earth and make them \nwish they had never been born.\n\nTaking their children from them as well and the fathers MIGHT get \nvisitation 4 days a month, but the mother always, always alienates the \nchildren from the father by feeding the children's heads full of lies, \ntelling the children their father left them and doesn't love them, when 80% \nof the time it's the mother who leaves the father because she starts \nfucking around with other men.  \n\nOr the mother makes a false accusation against the father and then he is \nlegally kept from ever seeing his children ever again with a restraining \norder. Why? Because women today are nothing more than spiteful pieces of \nshit. And today they have god like power legally over men and family. Which \nis why over half of men are staying completely away from marriage.\n\nA lot has changed in the last 30 years since you've been off planet or \nwhatever in the fuck you were doing (????) Marriage today is an \n*abomination.* \n\n\"You know nothing about those divorces.\"\n\nYes I do. I have the *statistics.* I know that women initiate 80% of \ndivorces and the no.1 reason given is 'dissatisfaction.' But if you've ever \nmet a female before you know exactly what that means: They've started \nfucking someone else and ready to cash out of their current marriage. \n\n\"Do you honestly think that women just think \"I want to rip off a man for \nthe next 10 years. I know!!! I'll date him, pretend to love him, MARRY him, \nDIVORCE him, and take all of his money!!!\" ?\"\n\n*Yes.* Haha You sure don't know much about women! \n\n\"Also, do you even know how divorces work?

The only reason a woman \nmarries a man in the first place is if he has a significant income and/or \nwealth, far more than hers.

Why do you think 80% of \nadvertising is targeting to women? So again 99% of women enter a marriage \nwith nothing.\n\nAnd DURING the marriage all married couples work like this: The money HE \nearns goes to pay the mortgage, bills, cars, a certain percentage into \nsavings, etc. HER money she might earn if she works at all she spends on \nherself on frivolous consumer items, expensive restaurants she goes to \nwithout her husband and even vacations by herself.\n\nWomen today are completely self centered and self absorbed subhumans \ncompletely incapable of love or caring for another human being and men to \nthem are nothing but ATM machines."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv8DUocR30_eZqRLl_vVoBA", "inappropriate_score": 0.356718192627824, "authorDisplayName": "Sydney S", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z134i1lobmy3cxqfe23nhtjbqqzxz1r4104", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-07-08T17:44:41.172Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCv8DUocR30_eZqRLl_vVoBA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.55510199999999998, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-07-08T17:44:41.172Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113925176694380433521", "textDisplay": "+Jeff Bridges Are you literally ignoring everything I say?

Yes, I see where you're coming from, and \nI have to concede that yours is, by and large, the more coherent position.\n\nIt sounds that what you mean by leadership in boys is their setting an \nexample for others to follow, as opposed to direct delegation and more \nformalised instruction (the sort of thing we associate with more complex \nforms of adult organisation). It is said that a good leader leads by \nexample. Whilst there is undoubtedly a large grain of truth to this, it \nappears to be of only tangential relevance in today's adult institutions \nwhen it comes to setting, enacting, and running policy, whilst it can and \nperhaps should be the driving ethos of hierarchies among younger people.\n\nYour key distinction appears to be between the concepts of leadership and \nauthority, and this appears to be where I have been getting muddled. You've \naddressed the point more effectively than I, in that while (I maintain) \nboys only really respect the authority of the adult male, they will also \nrespect, I now concede, delegated authority when appropriate safeguards \nagainst peer malfeasance are in place. They will (by and large) begrudge \nthe skipper (because boys are innately individualistic), but they'll \nrespect him and his station if they respect the organisation to which they \nbelong.\n\nWhere I think we are getting our wires crossed a bit is in how much of this \nis analysis and how much advocacy. You adopted a rather accusatory tone \nthroughout, which I'm used to. Perhaps a little too used to, because in \nthis instance I think the accusation - that I am too willing to abdicate \nresponsibility - is well founded. Analysis: boys are more individualistic \nthan girls. Advocacy: because of this fact, boys need structure in their \nlives more than do girls. Analysis: too formalised structures among the \nyoung produce authoritarian types (potentially ruinous in young men) and \nretard natural development. Advocacy: therefore the model utilised must be \none of demonstrate, don't explicate; organise, but don't coerce.\n\nOh well, not sure how much of this you agree with, but this discussion has \nhelped me.\n\nThanks again. 0-1"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzyLKjStHda2j0je3Fklj_Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "proctain", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qtj04rumuttzbo04cf3qruvnltjara1g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-04T05:04:32.962Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCzyLKjStHda2j0je3Fklj_Q"}, "sentiment_score": 0.185166, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-04T05:04:32.962Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105661928622595105745", "textDisplay": "+HerzWatIThink  I do think this is going no where as well.  The reason I \nsee is that you can only see status and position. You see status seeking \n(better read as attention seeking) girls with their social manipulations as \nsuperior to boys.  Demonstrate a belief in that being communal breeds \nleadership.  It doesn't.  It breeds a democracy of sorts, it can breed an \nin-group bias, and it can breed group think, but it doesn't breed \nleadership.   Just because a group has a leader or more appropriately a \nhierarchical pinnacle, does not in itself act as evidence of leadership. \n\nGood leadership brings those individuals and their individuals talents, \nskill sets, and strengths together to act as a stronger whole. Today's \nmedia is the one filled with erroneous message that boys only act \nindividually and only win on personal strengths, but are always defeated by \na well organized group (mostly girls now).\n\nYou are confusing being a leader with being a boss.  This is extremely \ncommon today.  A boss commands and does nothing, something that happens \noften in groups of girls.  A leader suggest and acts with the group.  That \nmore often happens with boys because the individual boys will more likely \nthen not listen to someone that shares in the burden while ignoring those \nthat merely place a burden on them.\n\nAs for Boy Scouts (for understanding it was a activity that I detested as \nwell as detesting the people I shared it with)  AUTHORITY rested with the \nadults but authority does not make leadership.  Good leadership then grants \nthe leader authority.  Position is not the only place that a leader come \nfrom.  Scout masters place boys in authority of other boys as a test of \nleadership.  If the boy cannot lead his peers then the authority is \nrescinded and they move on to another boy.  They do find responsible \nleaders of other boys all the time.  They find actual leaders who have \nleadership abilities all the time.  Those leaders are not the adults.  In \nnumerous cases the adults act to insure safety and to be a source of \ngreater experience, but also not get in the way of the boys gaining \nexperience themselves.\n\nJust because you cannot conceptualize leadership in boys and dogmatically \nonly think that girls who practice high usage of social skills can have \nleadership is a failing in you.  A personal failing does not make reality.  \nGo and look for the leadership you are missing.  I bet it is so close to \nhome and just under your nose that you are ignoring in favor of a view that \nplaces girls on a pedestal of unearned achievement."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu92Kd6e6BOLuLNCuvznCUA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "HerzWatIThink", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13qtj04rumuttzbo04cf3qruvnltjara1g", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-04T03:58:44.754Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCu92Kd6e6BOLuLNCuvznCUA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.35207000000000005, "formal_score": 93, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-04T03:58:44.754Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112189634994911410346", "textDisplay": "+proctain You keep misconstruing what I'm saying.\nBoys are as concerned with hierarchy as girls if not more so, at least with \nits enforcement.

I assure you that feminists \ndo not hate men. What frustrates us is bigots and people who excuse the \nactions of those that oppress women and girls worldwide. Another huge \nblockade in this movement is derailment, where a valid point regarding \nviolence against women is derailed by blocking one's ears and saying, \"Not \nall men\". Feminists are not accusing all men of these actions. But because \nof a patriarchal society there are so many obstacles to women being \nafforded equal rights and this is not every man's fault, but is everyone's \nresponsibility to change this. By saying that women should be able to get \nthemselves out of this mess without men is short-sighted. What Ms Watson \nsaid is that more than 50% of the population should be invited to the \nconversation. Why? Because its in everyone's best interests to abolish this \ninequality and changing patriarchal ideas about women is not just about how \nwomen behave and but also about how they are treated by everyone (including \nmen). This goes for every human rights movement, not just feminism. By \nempowering and educating women, we can improve infant health and the \neconomies of developing countries and I believe that this is what she was \ntalking about regarding education. As a result of societal pressures in \nthese developing nations, women often do not even complete their primary \nschooling before they begin to rear children. As a result, the total \nfertility rate is enormously high and the maternal and infant mortality and \nmorbidity is also sky-high. This leads to enormous pressure on the \neconomies of the developing world. Empowering and educating women is a huge \npublic health consideration for this reason.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGJdZ5BccRW2kQUwJ72O5rA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "myfavs", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13uypwylkiidxa4r04ced2jhvy4yj0pivc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-13T01:54:23.405Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGJdZ5BccRW2kQUwJ72O5rA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.65341999999999989, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-13T01:54:23.405Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112329097930488885038", "textDisplay": "+Dhivya Thangavel  But you don't hate men.....LOL"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5WfXF96xHFuc9c1T-smn7w", "inappropriate_score": 0.59880239520958078, "authorDisplayName": "kim621100", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13uypwylkiidxa4r04ced2jhvy4yj0pivc0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-02-19T01:50:05.960Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC5WfXF96xHFuc9c1T-smn7w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.51591199999999993, "formal_score": 95, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-02-19T01:50:05.960Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100409085845712934260", "textDisplay": "You are full of shit.Every time a state tries to create a joint child \ncustody bill , the League Of Women Voters and NOW POUR MONEY TO KILL THE \nBILL.fEMINIST CREAT AND LOBBY FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS THAT DISCRIMINATE \nAGAINST MEN.VAWA is the worst.It pays bribe money to police if they arrest \nboys and men for domestic violence complaints and sexual assault \ncomplaints.All college womens studies classes teaches hate against men, \nboys and christians with this patriarchy boogie man crap "}}]}, "z13nuxljjzynvjrdo22hj3qxummhvvjpp04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRe4nG4DGrO90MBhEmw0kmA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "erwin s", "isDirected": 1, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-05-11T05:58:39.590Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRe4nG4DGrO90MBhEmw0kmA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.86653029999999998, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2015-05-11T05:58:39.590Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112093863358208611201", "textDisplay": "subbed +1\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13stzkwjmecczuqn04cgrm4dwahhr3bmzc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy5ngnLJECUt-V_OZPlawNg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cFlVs51ezdk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFU/Mpy34R8GBwA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.46948356807511737, "authorDisplayName": "theeggtimer tic tic", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T10:38:36.997Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCy5ngnLJECUt-V_OZPlawNg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.13608799999999999, "formal_score": 8, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T10:48:34.000Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102322434523229551851", "textDisplay": "Until woman grows a penis and man births a child there will be no \n'equailty'.

My head hurts. The whole point is being missed. We are quite \ncapable of affecting change on our own, but it will go much faster if both \ngenders work together. The Underground Railroad was made up of blacks, \nwhites, and even Native Americans. The LGBT rights movement involves \nstraight allies. Asking for help is a strength, not a weakness, and it is \nthe only way to break down the \"us vs. them\" paradigm. It's about creating \na partnership, not about needing a savior.\n\nRegarding the \"women, don't hit your boys\" point, agreed. Don't do that. In \nfact, no one hit anyone unless you are in a fight for your life or \nsomething. But thinking that's going to fix gender inequality is a bit of a \n(read: \"a huge\") stretch. \n\nI do think a nice point was made about asking men about their rights \nissues. Often, in order to correct an injustice, we overcorrect, which I \nthink is something we need to monitor and can do when we get both sides \ninvolved. And getting both sides involved is exactly what this campaign \naims to do.\n\nI applaud Emma Watson. The ideal of gender equality is seen as very \n\"Western\", and trying to impart such an ideal to a very multicultural \naudience without being extremely divisive must have been nerve-wracking. \nWas it perfect? No. But anyone can be Monday morning quarterback. It's \ndefinitely far from \"tragic\", and most would say it is pretty great. I'm \nsure she will learn from others as her time in this position goes on and \nshe'll continually add to the discussion.

You \npoint out several areas where men are unfairly treated due to gender, and \nyou are correct. I can only assume that you did not listen to all of Emma's \nspeech. She most certainly addressed that point. Watch it again. I know of \nmany \"feminists\" who also pull for men in regards to father's rights, \ngender stereotyping, etc. +rebels heart, what are you talking about?! Of \ncourse they care about women in third world countries! What do you think \nthe very purpose of this UN meeting was?! Again, Emma addressed this in her \nspeech, which you obviously didn't listen to. You can't really spout off \nabout something if you're not informed (it actually does more harm to your \nposition than good). Just one of many examples I can give is former \nsupermodel Wari Dirie, who's been campaigning for years to stop female \ngenital mutilation (they call it \"female circumcision\") with her Desert \nFlower Foundation. Further, Stefan, threats of violence against anyone is \njust plain wrong, of course, but with that being said, I can't help \nwondering what on earth your group was meeting about that had that feminist \ngroup so riled up. Was it hateful? Was it promoting discrimination against \nanother group of people? I notice you left that part out of your story. As \nI read several of the comments to this video, all I could think to myself \nis \"why do they feel so threatened by someone else being on even footing as \nthem?\". Personally, I've never seen the thrill in controlling others. Live \nand let live. Love each other and want good things for your fellow man. As \nlong as your own rights aren't being trampled on, it shouldn't upset you \nfor others to have rights, too.

Your claim that Emma Watson's \nconcern about male sensitivity/emotional expression or lack thereof is \nproof that she gives a damn about men at all is bullshit. First of all, for \nmost men, emotional expression isn't a groundbreaking issue like Emma \nignorantly claims it is. Men will express their emotions when they damn \nwell please, to whomever they want to and do it in the manner in which they \nchoose to. Emma ignorantly claims that men expressing emotion and \nsensitivity the the exact same manner women do is the key to solving male \nissues. Wrong!!! Men's issues are the disparity in workplace deaths, \ndomestic violence unfairness, more severe punishments for similar crimes, \ndivorce court/custody unfairness, father's rights etc. You think she'd \nwaste a minute of her precious time addressing those inequalities even \nthough she claims to be a gender equality activists \"in the full spectrum, \nnot men/women on opposite spectrum? Hell No!! So Emma Watson all her wisdom \nand expertise narrows men's issues down to \"not crying enough.\" It's like \n\"here men, I threw you a bone, now join us and help us attain further \nprivelages.\" Her speech said that she wants to end \"Predjudice against \nwomen\" and promote \"emotional expression in men\" as if men don't experience \ninequality/prejudice at all. Once upon a time, probably when your dad was a \nstain in your granddaddy's underpants, femininism meant something. \nFeminists fought for real issues, like the right to vote, the right to \neducation, rights to their bodies etc. they achieved that. Many countries \nacross the world where women really are oppressed (like not here in \nU.S./Europe), women desperately need THAT kind of feminism. But which one \nof your feminist heroes are brave enough to ply your trade there, huh? \nThird Wave Feminism (#heforshe) is fighting for ENTITLEMENT and PRIVELAGE \nand to be relieved of unpleasant RESPONSIBILITY. \nAnd if you want to be a catalyst for this kind of poison for your \ngeneration, then I hope you get your tubes tied because somebody this \nignorant does not deserve to procreate and contaminate the rest of the \nworld."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmR7WuXy0A8TcsJDwAPah9w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Izack coreas", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13vs5iyovrasbswm04cfnrzexirezwpkfg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-10-29T16:22:18.743Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmR7WuXy0A8TcsJDwAPah9w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.16438400000000003, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-10-29T16:22:18.743Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-du4WO2UrM1E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/MHYy5yygCVc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106334601664040130414", "textDisplay": "+Jack Hunt women are able to do whatever a man could .

As a gay man I can tell you there is massive homophobia against gay men, \nthere is massive racism against black men, and there is massive \nantisemitism against jewish men. There is massive discrimination against \nMuslim men, atheist men and there is massive ageism against young men and \nboys. Why all this ridiculous obsession with women?? Are they the only ones \nwho suffer?? Or are they the only ones who can play the victim (so they can \nkeep milking it...)\n\n2. He for she??? What about she for he? Or he for he? Or good people for \nanyone who needs help? What the hell does he for she even mean? \nTraditionalism? Servitude? Worship? I'm not going to spend the rest of my \nlife being a utility and pleasing some self obsessed feminist woman.\n\n3. They chose Emma Watson? I mean... They chose EMMA WATSON??? Really???? A \nwhite rich western British privileged cisgendered wealthy woman with 32 \nmillions of dollars has to represent poor women in third world \ncountries???? Oh well I bet that millions of African women or Latino women \nin South America or Asian women will be very happy that the UN has chosen a \nRICH WHITE WESTERN person with millions of dollars in her bank account. Not \na slap in the face of those who are starving and are truly underprivileged \nat all. No way. It makes perfect sense in the crazy world of feminists.\ufeff\n\nNo she didn't make excellent points. She made the UN look like a bunch of \npussy begging desperados.\n\n\"Hello my name is Emma and I'm white and rich, please give me a round of \napplause because I have a vagina between my legs. I'm here to ask men I \ndon't even know to turn themselves into disposable unpaid bodyguards \neverytime a strong independent woman is week and depends on men. Let me \ntell you that we don't hate men, we just need them to serve us. And give us \npriority. And extra rights. And more privileges. And some money as a side \ndish because we're not prostitutes and getting money from men we don't even \nknow without having to work hard for that money is not prostitution in the \nslightest way. Now clap your hands because my make up artists made me look \nlike a sexual object. Which is something I despise because medias keep \nsexualising me without giving me any money. Objectification is wrong if \nthere is no money for me. If there is... bring it on. Oh btw... equality!\"\n\nYou know. .. part of misandry is caused by men (like you in this particular \noccasion) who are just incapable of saying that a woman can be 100% wrong. \nNo, because there is some universal law which says that women can never be \n100% wrong. So if they're full of crap, we're going to say: \"oh well she \ndid make some excellent points\". If she's partially full of crap we're \ngoing to say: \"she was mostly right!\" And if she's mostly right we'll say: \n\"everything she says is golden truth because vagina has some special power \nand I'm biologically programmed to let females get away with ginormous \nhorse shit\".\n\nOk so I'll tell you what this is. This is pure and simple \nheteronormativity. Straight men look at Emma Watson and their testicles \nstart to boost testosterone production which will hijack their minds and \nlet them think: \"omg her boobs made some excellent points now if you excuse \nme my penis needs an ambulance because it just exploded in my pants after \nseeing all that L'Or\u00e9al make up\".\n\nThis is amazing. Female worship without the slightest shame. So I guess the \nvery few smart straight guys now know why the UN chose Emma Watson instead \nof some fat old ship wreck who looks like something between Danny DeVito \nand a dying Lama.\n\ufeff\nBut ALL black women, Asian women, latino women, aboriginal women and Maori \nwomen and native American women should know one ugly piece of REAL \nmisogyny. It's not just about female worship. This is about white female \nworship. The UN wants you to know that today in 2014 we all still worship \nthe superior beauty of white women of North Western, germanic, anglosaxon \nheritage.\n\n\"Dear African women... We know you are suffering unimaginable poverty and \noppression, but please understand that you are a little TOO DARK to \nrepresent the women we worship here in the west\".\n\nThis is incredibly disgusting. So basically the UN has managed to be \nsexist, misandric, racist, ageist, misogynist and monumentally full of \nshit. Well done. Next time you want to tell us something about tsunamis and \nearthquakes that destroy everything in Japan or Chile or Indonesia, please \ndon't forget to show us some fantastic pictures of the most beautiful homes \nin Beverly Hills. Who knows, maybe George Clooney will show up at the UN \nand start a campain called Fukushima for Hollywood. I can imagine.\n\nThe only problem: George Clooney doesn't have a vagina. They'll probably \nask his new wife to do that.

"authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104097509189966841209", "textDisplay": "Emma Watson, why are you hiding behind the expression \u201cgender equality\u201d? \n The HeForShe campaign is NOT about gender equality, it\u2019s about protecting \nwomen and girls, and only them.  As found on the web site, it is \u201ccommitted \nto take action against all forms of violence and discrimination faced by \nwomen and girls\u201d: it\u2019s obvious that those women want to exclude violence \nand discrimination faced by men and boys, as if issues affecting men and \nboys shouldn\u2019t be equally addressed.  The feminist sexism of the HeForShe \ncampaign creates two classes of citizens: those who are important enough to \nbe protected (women and girls), and those who are left to themselves (men \nand boys), without explicit protection from organizations or governments. \nThey are implicitly, or \u201cde facto\u201d, considering men and boys as second \nclass citizens.  How did we end up accepting such extreme sexism from these \nwomen?  Aren\u2019t there any women (or men) who also care about their sons, or \nthe men of their lives (or men as a group)?  This campaign shows again that \nsocieties (and especially some sexist, feminist-women) care less about men \nthan women, and even more monstrous, that they care less about boys than \ngirls.\n \nThere can\u2019t be a gender equality without having a movement that also \ninclude the liberation of men. How can we pretend seeking gender equality \nwhen we are not even able to say that sending men to wars or to a military \nservice was, and still is, a sexism against MEN?  Or if we hide that \n\u201cchild-soldiers\u201d are in fact \u201cboy-soldiers\u201d, as if we were unable, as a \nsociety, to admit that this is a problem affecting almost exclusively boys \n(shame on us).  When we listen to a feminist-women, we can see that she has \nno empathy toward men (she only speaks about women and girls), especially \nwhen they speak about the \u201cAfrican women\u201d: we can see their total lack of \nsolidarity toward the \u201cAfrican men\u201d (\u2026and boys!).  These women should be \nashamed of their misandry, and if they are not, ALL women should be ashamed \nthat they pretend to speak in their name.  Emma Watson should be ashamed of \nthis accepted misandry which is building up in the society, because of \ncampaigns like HeForShe.  In the USA, Hillary Clinton should be ashamed of \nbeing one of the strongest advocate for this feminist sexism. Women must \nevolve too, they must learn that showing only solidarity and empathy toward \ntheir own gender IS a form of sexism from their part, and they should be \nashamed of what these sexist, feminist women are doing on issues affecting \nmen (they are preventing liberation of men).  They must learn to show \nsolidarity and empathy toward their \u201copposite gender\u201d (like men do), at \nleast as much as they are toward their own.\n \nTraditionally, men have the role of protecting \u201cwomen and children\u201d, and \nthis constitute a sexism in itself (against men), because woman should also \npay the price for \u201cprotecting the nation\u201d, and they should not receive more \nprotection (from men or societies) than men.  What the HeForShe campaign is \nasking is to perpetuate this sexist expectation that some women have toward \nmen: they want men (\u2026 and boys!) to protect \u201cwomen and girls\u201d.  By the way, \nnotice that we passed from the concept of protecting \u201cwomen and children\u201d \nto protecting \u201cwomen and girls\u201d (boys are of the wrong gender I suppose): \ndo you consider this as \u201cgender equality\u201d, Emma Watson?\n \nWe don\u2019t live in a world where only women are oppressed, and where only men \nhave privileges: women, societies, also have sexist expectations towards \nmen, and women also have privileges (\u2026 one of them being the solidarity and \nempathy we show towards women and girls, but not towards men and boys, as \ndemonstrated by this HeForShe campaign).  A few decades ago, sexism and \nissues affecting women were not recognized, and we see the same phenomenon \nwith the sexism and issues affecting men: we don\u2019t recognize this \nparticular sexism (we didn\u2019t learn).\n \nIssues affecting men and boys must be equally addressed: men and sometimes \nboys are forced into \u201cslavery\u201d with military services or conscriptions (for \nexample, we must force nations to stop this sexism and force mandatory \nmilitary service or conscriptions for women too, if they are not ready to \neliminate it).  Men occupy dangerous jobs which leads to overrepresentation \nin job related deaths and health issues.  In demonstrations, men are far \nmore likely to be targeted for violence or killing, and they are more \nlikely to be massacred in wars or genocides.  A man\u2019s life expectancy is \nshorter than a woman\u2019s life expectancy, and we close our eyes on the sexism \nleading to this imbalance.  Same thing with the education problems \naffecting boys (because of the incompatibility between education and the \ntraditional role they are destined to), which is not addressed the same way \nthey are addressed when discrimination is affecting girls.\n \nAs we can see at the UN and other organizations sites, when they use the \nexpression \u201cwomen and children\u201d (which exclude men), they are in fact \npromoting discrimination against men by only considering the mother-child \nlink, to the expense of the father-child link (as if the mother-child link \nwas more important): that\u2019s pure sexism against men.  And this, despite the \nfact that men is the gender which is discriminated against when it comes to \nchild cares (considered not compatible with men\u2019s traditional roles).  The \nUN, instead of fighting against this woman\u2019s privilege, is perpetuating it, \nand has the indecency to call this gender equality.\n \nWe see this same sexist double standard in regards to genital mutilations \n(GM), which is treated differently depending on the gender of the victim.  \nGM made on girls is considered a crime, while GM made on boys is not (and \nwe invent all sorts of to excuse to justify this double standard, or \nsexism).\n \nThis feminist sexism has created a new privileged group: women and girls, \nbecause the violence and discrimination affecting them are being addressed, \nwhile the violence and discrimination affecting men and boys are not being \naddressed.  Men and women must fight against the sexism of this \u201cHeForShe\u201d \ncampaign, because gender equality is not about caring only for women and \ngirls, it is not about protecting women and girls only, it\u2019s about fighting \nall kind of sexism, including the sexist expectations of societies (and \nwomen) toward men\u2026 and including this \u201cneo\u201d sexism introduced by the \nfeminist ideology.\n \nI think we can only achieve gender equality by developing a new \n\u201canti-feminist\u201d progressive movement, which would fight for both men\u2019s and \nwomen\u2019s rights: for a real gender equality.  On the contrary, if we \ncontinue to only show solidarity toward women and girls (= feminist \nsexism), we will antagonize and polarize societies that we want to change, \nand movements fighting for human rights will continue to lose ground to \nmore conservative values (because they are not fair, bring injustices and \ndouble standards affecting men and boys).\n \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12rttorbwv2wxi4n04cdzcoftiax50pvdw": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_5WezRVunzsKmsyIYWmMcA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AbaW59PP4aY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAP0/ftMZRhnRSYY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Matt", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-11T06:49:29.932Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_5WezRVunzsKmsyIYWmMcA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.9212823, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-11T06:49:29.932Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100958482796520267711", "textDisplay": "one minute and 30 seconds in, and i quit watching. stupid question.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z121sfqq3wqyzdso404ccfiw5njzfxcjfks0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMPOcYAF226RdLLHLV-BJOg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "austinnutrition", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T15:41:33.867Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMPOcYAF226RdLLHLV-BJOg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T15:41:33.867Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101817415457418107693", "textDisplay": ""}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12tvxe5fz3nwbugm04cfvupkornitvhvyo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKQC62socgbXh6FuHST8ehw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2BNunKjyuE0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABQ/DY1DAImKAx8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Danos138", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-30T02:40:08.090Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKQC62socgbXh6FuHST8ehw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.14627600000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-30T02:40:08.090Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101515933507967009786", "textDisplay": "Aren't boys also physically (not sexually) hit/assault/abused 4 times more \nthan girls?\n\nLets stop hitting all children but I think that is something along the \nlines of what Stefan was talking about.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13au1abuledzzwui22zv3mx1ua0v3usk": {"main_comment": "", "replied_comment": []}, "z12si50h4oeajppou04cgfb53yzge14wyew": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRaPH1F2PjjjTTynLehyF5g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OpzK_tOLTYE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACE/gGRhZ_0IlfU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "blurglide", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-16T06:29:03.356Z", "videoId": "8o0euhM6bjg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRaPH1F2PjjjTTynLehyF5g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.77724799999999994, "formal_score": 20, "updatedAt": "2015-04-16T06:29:03.356Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118186682376233804588", "textDisplay": "When a woman has conceived a fetus (and ideally far before), she should \nbring a contract to the father, much like a marriage contract but less \nawful, that he'll agree to at least financially support the child.

Last night, young people who have never seen a \nriot in their lives braved tear gas and armed riot police to make a stand. \nThey put their hands up in the face of police brutality, never hitting back.\n\nTonight, up to a million are on the streets, on social media, making a \nnon-violent stand together.

I have 3 little sister who gave up \nsports for the same reason. Have a look at the state of US women's sports \nand then have a look at the cheerleading culture. The reason for the \nreluctance among younger women to get muscles is the inherently binary \nnarrative of gender. These are developing identities. So long as we don't \ncreate the reinforce an environment based on 'a spectrum' our children will \ncontinue to identify only within the duality of gender.

Your \nwide ranging 'ad priory' positions are more ideologically informed, because \nno-one has the time to research all the causes taken up by hollywood actors \n- but something must be informing your conscious decisions\u2026. am I right?\n\nEvery Feminist (male and female) i know in the Women's, Gender and \nSexuality department at my uni is perhaps an ideologue.

What sort of \nworld do you want to live in?\n\nSheryl Sandberg is an extremely successful woman in a male dominated \nindustry, it would be her perception that women aren't oppressed - she is \nnot a social researcher and furthermore you shouldn't use the exception to \ndefine the rule. 1% does not equal 99%\n\nIf you knew anything about linguistics or the constitution and repetition \nof myths within societies you would not use the word 'rescue', like they \nare damsels in distress waiting for men to ride in on there shinny white \nhorses to relieve them from their entrapment. This is exactly the sort of \nlanguage we're trying to get rid from our society. Thank you for \ndemonstrating so well the point (or at least part) of the argument. \n\nWhat is wanted, what is needed, is a deeper understanding of what it means \nto be an individual and to live in this world with fairness and equity for \neveryone. Ones gender, sex, race, nationality, class determine ones chances \nin life too much. No one is suggesting that that will change, it will \nalways be that way. However if we truly want to live in a Meritocracy men \nneed to understand that the 'social norms' they have been brought up with \nmay inhibit the lives of other 50% - not to mention our own.\n\nI have seen prescriptive and essentialist ideas of womanhood damage someone \nin my family and though I know no daughter of mine will have those issues - \n I will do my bit to make sure that no one else's does either.
