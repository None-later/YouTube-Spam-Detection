No, you see, I know the \nworld is round because of scientific evidence.\n\nNow, if you\u2019ve got any evidence that communing with the dead is truly \npossible other than your own experience and a choreographed TV show, I\u2019m \nhappy to take a look at that. Otherwise all you\u2019re really saying is that it \nhappened to you and everyone else should believe that, for you, it was real \n(despite the overwhelming evidence that it is not). Also you keep harking \nthat by my saying that I\u2019m unwilling to be scammed by a charlatan that I \ncan\u2019t possibly know it is a false reality.  I\u2019ve never visited the surface \nof the sun either but because of science and documentation, I can be sure \nthat it exists.  I don\u2019t have to go there to know that.  I also don\u2019t have \nto have ever gone on a unicorn or leprechaun hunt to know those aren\u2019t real \neither. Generally speaking, society on a whole has abandoned such silly \nsuperstitious beliefs bur for some reason, this idea of communing with dead \nrelatives persists. Why? Because it preys upon the desires of the \ndesperate, that\u2019s why.  And because there is coin to be made from it so it \ncontinues to perpetuate.  God damn Theresa Caputo and every one of her \nstealing, swindling comrades.  They are as scummish as those TV preachers \nthat tell their congregation to pray with their monetary offerings and they \nappeal to the same type of naivet\u00e9.\n\nLike I said before, we\u2019ve got plenty of proof that these people are \ntricksters; not just this video either. It\u2019s all over the place. If you\u2019ve \ngot proof that it is possible to communicate with the dead, then bring it. \n Otherwise, piss off.

How easy to create a god that conveniently \"created man in \nhis own image\" to avoid thinking outside of our own reflection and how \narrogant to propose a deity created the entire universe just for us, his \nextra-special creation endowed with the attributes and in the image of his \nomnipotent, eternal, perfectly just image, as the creator of all. Talk \nabout projecting our insecurities and our hopes and desires on a convenient \nanswer to questions we refused to humble ourselves with the simple \nadmission that we do not know the answer.\n\nMeanwhile what we have just recently discovered about the far reaches of \nour universe is far more humbling and far beyond our imagination that it is \nabsurd to consider a creator beyond all of the incomprehendable and \nunrecognizable nature of the universe we find ourselves embedded within is \nsomehow orders of magnitude more similar to us than the reality of the \nuniverse we experience and live within everyday.\n\nIn reality religion is not about humbly being part of something bigger than \nus, but is more often an escape from the confused, chaotic fact that we do \nnot fully understand who we are, where we come from and where we are going \nas we hurdle on a tiny skipping stone around an indistinguishable star, \nflowing along in a remote corner of a star cluster, forming an \ninconspicuous arm similar to any other that is the signature of any \nstandard spiral galaxy that can not be singled out amongst the backdrop of \nthe endless galaxies dotted like single stars in the sky throughout the \nobservable universe. These galaxies form billions of single points, each \ncontaining billions of stars, with trillions of planets in other solar \nsystems of which we have ventured to none beyond our own. The voyager \nspacecraft, decades later, has just reached the farthest reaches still \ncaught within our own sun's gravitational pull. We have never reached even \nbeyond the influence of our own sun outside of observing beyond with the \ntelescopes that show the trillions of stars still unexplored.\n\nReligion is an escape from being the part in something greater that \nreligion claims itself to be. An escape from the fact that on the universal \nscale we are less than microscopic, meaningless, not special in any way and \nit is our responsibility to create our own meaning and understand our \npersonal significance as part of shared humanity capable of recognizing the \nrole we find ourselves, in this corner of the universe that has become \nself-aware and is now discovering itself."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkBxWd-Hzg36IyUap40ukqw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MeinLuciFuhrer", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z124d15rdzzfilfkd22cxz1zsxmqgj1uw", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-16T16:58:14.008Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkBxWd-Hzg36IyUap40ukqw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.329926, "formal_score": 63, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-16T16:58:14.008Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115678643795860548990", "textDisplay": "+Steve WK I was wondering if anyone would bother to read it so I appreciate \nthe response!

More like an idea, a wishful \nthought that if you have a soul, you will go on existing through your soul, \nand travel through the universe. There is nothing wrong in believing that. \nIn a way it is already true as we are primarily carbon-based and partly \nmade up of heavier elements, of which the synthesis of the former can only \noccur during helium fusion in the core of a star and the synthesis of the \nlatter under the extreme conditions that only naturally occur in the core \nof exploding supernovae. We are made of the remnants of star dust spread \nthroughout the universe by collapsing stars and exploding supernovae. There \njust wasn't any consciousness experiencing the formation and spreading of \nour body's elements throughout the universe until they happened to collect \nin a hospitable niche within the habitable zone of a star with an \nappropriate mass that has provided stable energy output long enough for \nself-replication and natural selection to diversify into the current animal \nkingdom and more specificallly, us, homo sapiens.\n\nOnce our sun consumes enough of it's hydrogen fuel and expands into a \nrapidly self-consuming red giant, expanding right up to our doorstep, \nincinerating Mercury and Venus along the way, the end of our solar system \nwill mark the next chapter in the elements in our bodies journey throughout \nthe cosmos. \n\nYour belief is not too far off in implausibility. More importantly it is \nnon-descriptive, does not claim to be fact, does not demand adherence, does \nnot claim divine authority, does not impose a rigid moral code, does not \nclaim infallibility, does not view anyone that disagrees as infidels, does \nnot view any ex-believers that changed their opinion as apostates, does not \nview anyone that mocks the idea as blasphemers and does not demand \nadherents to violently enforce adherence and defend the belief.\n\nThis means yourbelief alone will not cause you to hate, condemn or murder \nbehind the belief of divine moral righteousness to impose a strict legal \ncode that curtails personal liberty that is infallible and can not be \nchanged, severely limiting our ability to continue humanity's progress in \ncreating an ever-better society because the belief system must be followed \nin order to be morally righteous obedient worshippers of the ultimate \nauthority under which such tyrannical authoritarianism is justified and \nwhose will and grace we must be eternally grateful for creating our very \nexistence in the first place.\n\nThis simply means your belief is unlike the most dangerous consequences of \nadhering to the irrational, immoral, scientifically ignorant and factually \nincorrect assertions the prominent religions claim simply on faith alone \nand can be seen violently manifesting still to this day.\n\nWith that being said, your belief is simply wishful thinking placating our \ndeepest fear that religion has exploited. That is our fear of \nnon-existence. Death. There is no other reason to believe we will live on \nafter death as there is no evidence for the existence of a soul, a mind \nwithout a brain, or an afterlife. It's an overwhelming fact that everything \nin our life will culminate in the almost certain abrupt end of our entire \nexistence, but we owe it to ourselves to be honest and humble in accepting \nour inevitable death, which only makes our life much more valuable in it's \nacknowledged scarcity, and inspires an appreciation and motivation to live \nlong and healthy in order to make the most out of the precious opportunity \nwe have been granted against all odds. To experience self-aware agency with \nthe cognitive ability to understand communicable language and to decipher \nthe sensory input required to explore and discover our tiny corner of the \nuniverse to share with one another is the rarest opportunity I can fathom.\n\nThe little that we can demonstrate we actually know is powerful enough on \nit's own to give great meaning to my life, but it is a meaning we must all \nsubjectively realize personally, and inserting a magical, invisible \nomnipotent deity that we must live our short lives worshipping just to \navoid honestly answering the mysteries of life can only degrade the \npersonal meaning I've forged thus far. And if it all ends as all evidence \nindicates, with all of our thoughts and our mind ceasing to exist when our \nbrain no longer functions and eventually decomposes, I can accept death by \n reminding myself that I had no problems and experienced no discomfort for \nthe billions of years, and possibly an ongoing eternity, that passed before \nI was even born. If you can think back to before you were born, it's very \nlikely what it will be like after you die. Personally I am okay with that."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Z7gqoQtYN6y9DS5udI5lA", "inappropriate_score": 0.61349693251533743, "authorDisplayName": "T Anderson", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z124d15rdzzfilfkd22cxz1zsxmqgj1uw", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-16T03:37:16.461Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC2Z7gqoQtYN6y9DS5udI5lA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.286972, "formal_score": 9, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-03-16T15:45:55.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-w-GKDx72wt4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAG4/dkgLMyUxU_A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115754946399609170592", "textDisplay": "I see your point.

I am a sensitive.  It's Biblical.  But, and here is \nwhere I start taking issue, we are told not to try and contact the dead.  I \nbecome skeptical when someone walks in and begins \"reading\" numerous people \nin large groups.  I worry that either they are fakes or if not fakes then \nthat the spirits contacting them are perhaps not who they say they are.  \nNot to sound \"flakey\" myself but think about it, our loved ones are in \nHeaven, they know we are under God's care and they have much better things \nto do than congregate around sensitives  waiting to pass on short \nmessages.  Further I have a problem with someone who profits so greatly \nfrom others pain and by using such a special gift.  I don't believe God \nimparts this gift upon us to build us fortunes but rather only when there \nis a need that a message be delivered by a human.  We are to be His \nvessel.  Would His vessel charge an arm and a leg?  I just don't think so.  \nAnd last, as a sensitive ,  I do not seek out anything...and messages are \nnot unclear.  Perhaps I do not understand them but they are very clear.  I \ncan either see them played out as clear as a movie before my eyes or hear \nclearly and know who it is for usually something like \"Pray with her\" and \nmention such and such.  Typically I learn later it's more about timing than \ninformation.  My offer for prayer may come just after she learned someone \nclose passed...something like that.  It is possible that God gifts \ndifferent sensitives differently but why?  And my senses say beware.  Know \nyour loved ones are safe, happy and healthy  They likely leave you signs \nthey are around you themselves.  You don't need someone like her or me.  \nJust open your eyes.  Ever notice the smell of their cologne or a \nparticular bird that appears when you visit their grave?  (Just a couple \nexamples) Please guard your hearts.  It's a beautiful Gift, but don't pay \nfor it.

Do we know her personal life? Does she volunteer? \nDonate to charities? She seems to live a modest lifestyle.\n\nI'm curious how you feel about possessing a gift that the Bible says we are \nto avoid. I had such a phenomenal reading myself that it has left me \nquestioning my beliefs. I now KNOW there is an afterlife and I KNOW that \nihe afterlife is define. So how can I possibly see my reading as being \nSatanic? Other than the fact that I spoke to a medium, what did Satan gain?

But have \nyou considered that maybe she is reading the mind of the person being read \nand not communicating with the dead? If you believe in Mediums, certainly, \nyou can believe there are real psychics. Never ONCE has she told a person \nsomething they didn't already know. NEVER!!!! She calls it validation. I \ndon't think it validates anything. She needs to tell people things they \ndidn't know. When she doesn't have the answer to something that she should \n(if she was really talking with the dead), she brushes it off and says \n\"it's not for us to know\". I swear, if the person getting the reading \ndoesn't know the answer to something, neither does Theresa. Instead of \nclaiming to be a medium, she should claim to be a psychic. She does walk up \nto strangers in a store and know things about them or their departed, but \nagain, it's stuff they already know. It's in their mind. I wish people \nwould listen to her readings as they keep this concept in mind. She is \nmind-reading at the very least. She is not talking with the dead. When \nsurvivors of suicide victims want to know \"why did they do it\", Theresa \nsays something like \"the only thing you need to know is they are at peace \nand they take responsibility for their passing\" and they say they are sorry \nfor hurting anyone. Where's the proof in that? Why can't she say something \nthat CAN be validated and something that wasn't discussed during that \nreading/something the person didn't know about at all. FOR EXAMPLE, she can \nsay something like \"he says that nobody knew this, but he was struggling \nwith a secret drug addiction and couldn't go on any longer\". Now this would \nhave to be something the person being read, did not know about at all and \nnot discussed previously during the reading but could be validated later \nwith a little research by the loved one left behind. This is an example of \nreally communicating with the dead. She makes it all seem so simple, then \nwhy not validate by providing \"unknown\" information that only the deceased \nknows about. Because it's FAKE. Maybe she doesn't even know that she is \ngetting the information from the person right in front of her. Wake up \nTheresa Caputo. You ARE NOT speaking with the dead.

Similarly, according to OJ Simpson, OJ Simpson \ndid not kill anyone.\nA few interesting things here:\n\n1) Did you notice all the disclaimers on the page you linked? Insisting \nthat psychics should be a last resort, boldly yelling \"Psychics do not \nsolve crimes... police do!\" and, interestingly, admitting she \"cannot \nguarantee the outcome of a case\". If these psychic powers were real and \nactually reliable, none of these would be needed.\n\n2) Have you actually read the transcripts on the left of that page? Notice \nhow only very specific sections are shown instead of the full transcripts? \nNone of the testimony against her is shown including how even the woman who \nhired Renier to find the plane (Jessica Herbert) testified that Renier \ndidn't actually provide specific longitude and latitude numbers, but \"lots \nof numbers\" that she attempted to somehow relate to a map....numbers that \nhad *nothing* to do with where the plane was eventually found by \nauthorities. Renier said herself in her testimony that she never even had \nany contact with any of the authorities whatsoever.\n\n3) Renier didn't find the plane and none of her psychic information led to \nthe plane being found. She said there were survivors but there were none. \nMost of the specific details she gave had no match at all to the area \nexcept the very ubiquitous mention of dogs and \"old houses\". All she \nprovided were bad guesses no different from any other person's bad \nguesses....and she didn't even provide those to anyone conducting the \nactual investigation. She didn't even get the state right!\n\n4) To date, a total of 5 federal court judges have ruled against Renier.\n\nAs for the quote about Nancy Weber, you'll need to provide better sourcing \nthan an un-cited quote on a Victor Zammit website as I am unable to find \nany case or actual interview that quote might have come from.

Why is that? \nCould it be because these young guys on here would be disgusted if they \nknew that it is actually an old bat that's telling them they \"look hot\"? \nYou try so desperately to come off as young girl and it only makes you look \npathetic. \n\n\nYou also wrote, \"you told everyone on YouTube that you have seen me, when I \nhave never met you\" Again, your age issue is escalating. Fact is...I didn't \nsay I met you, I said you emailed me your pictures. Oh wait...or did I edit \nthat too? LOL\n\n\nAlthough this has gone beyond boring the hell out of me I still have to \nadmit I'm thrilled at how this all went down. When we parted ways months \nbefore, I was left with doubts whether or not it was the medium or you that \nwas lying. I couldn't imagine this medium who had given me such an amazing, \nhealing reading being anything less than the good person she portrayed \nherself to be. Although the way you ended our so called, \"friendship\" was \nleaning on psychotic, you still had me convinced that despite all your \nobvious flaws I \"thought\" you were at least honest. So..despite the \nugliness in all of this, I want to thank you Lori, for opening my eyes to \nthe truth."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRh8r4k6-4RGELQV-LbcZSw", "inappropriate_score": 5.882352941176471, "authorDisplayName": "she wee", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xwfzzhqn0gfyog04chdxidtylch0zni0", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-05T03:34:33.609Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRh8r4k6-4RGELQV-LbcZSw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.33687800000000001, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-04-05T03:34:33.609Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DVK0jzTZw_4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXM/zdNVNyok1Xg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106196340819888537054", "textDisplay": "+Lori Knoell You freak ass!

I learned that some of these \npeople know details from people's pasts not because they communicate with \nthe dead, but because they communicate with demons who are constantly \naround humans and know everything about us including some of our memories \nwe think no one knows about. So yes, they can speak about the past, but \nthey can only predict the future from having observed the past, so it is a \nguess.. I have never liked her show, especially since the dead are not \nconscious and can't communicate from the grave. Death is like a deep sleep \nand the dead are not aware of anyone on earth who is alive, anymore. We so \nwant to hear from people we miss and want some sort of connection and she \nknows this. One time David Letterman asked her to communicate with someone \nfor him and she said, \"It doesn't work like that\". HA!! obviously not, \nbecause her show is VERY scripted and cuts the scenes so it looks like she \nis always accurate with her readings.
