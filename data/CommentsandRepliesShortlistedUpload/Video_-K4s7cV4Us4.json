Why would she do this? Firstly to \nillustrate the feminist propensity for distorting the truth to fit the \nagenda. \nThey model their numbers with careful exclusions. When in the hard-core \ngamer arena, women are far from the majority. And the more hard-core you \nget (MLG, Lan-fest) the fewer there are.\nThe reference to female dominated talk shows is not a false equivalent, \nprat. It's an apt reference to a social segment that is mostly catering to \none gender. And it's a relevant counterpoint to pose. \nWell? Why do all these shows have to be so geared towards women? Well uh, \nthey're serving the market that is serving it. Ner? Which brings us back \nagain to the relevance of the gamer ratio. \nThe people lining the pockets the most are male gamers. And they are \ncheaply catering to that crowd. And they're entitled to. Should we cover \nthat word more carefully? You, you want more choice. \nThat's sweet. You want more choice. But you're not entitled to it. If they \nprovide it, great. But they're not obligated to provide it. Now, before you \nget carried away like I know you like to and think [Well, I never said \nthat, it would just be nice]. Perhaps it would, but your choice of words \nsmacks of petulance. \"I\".\"I want more choice\". The market isn't driven by \nwhat YOU want. However brilliant you think your thoughts are on the \nsubject. Sarkeesian chalks everything up to sexism, with no regard to the \ncounterpoint that contextualizes whether it is actually sexism. \n\n\"Most AAA Games are full of sexist tropes\". Well uh, that would be the part \nwe're disputing, turbo. Or, would you like to make your case based on \nSarkeesian's videos?\n\nHow about I go you one better. I'm fed up with games, not on the level of \nbeing sexist. Just for being bad. Lazy writers use proven formulas to make \nand sell games. \n\nOH GOSH! A few naughty nutters said some nasty things on TWITTER! \nSarkeesian insulting an entire group through generalization, which makes \nthe more reactive ones bite back. But it's sexism! Except when it happens \nto men. Because Jack Thompson in Mortal Kombat was all about male-bashing. \nSpeaking of violence, it's perplexing that you'd bemoan the conflation \nbetween violence and misogyny. Since she's addressing something in the \nterms it was presented to her, by Sarkeesian; who apparently perceives them \nwelded like a parasite to a pooch.\n \n\nP.S. Your musics almost as dodgy as Sarkeesian's tropes videos.

Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980 are less sexist \nthan Baby Boomers, and they also play video games. If there was a link \nbetween video games and sexism, the amount of sexism in culture would be \nout of control, it wouldn't be going down every generation. \n\nThis is a case of history repeating itself. In 1999, the same assholes who \nwhine and bitch like worthless cunts about sexism in video games tried to \nprove a direct link between violent video games and people going on a \nrampage and killing people in real life. Four years later, the Supreme \nCourt ruled no link was possible between the two, and the same thing is \nbound to happen with sexism. The same moral panic happened in the 1980s \nwhen whiny cunts tried to prove a causal link between heavy metal and \nsuicide, and what they found was that the people who listened to heavy \nmetal and committed suicide would have committed suicide regardless of \nwhether or not they listen to heavy metal. The same thing is happening \nhere. In other words, already sexist people might become more sexist if \nthey play video games. Wow, that's news. They also might be more sexist \nwhile watching porn or 2 Broke Girls. \n\nEvery single study that you have quoted was done for 1 month or less, in \nother words, short term. The study I quoted was over 3 years, 36 times \nlonger and in that study, they found no causal link between video games and \nsexist attitudes. It also had nearly 3 times as many participants, which \nmeans the survey size was considerably larger. \n\nThe only thing you've proven is that people who are inclined to be sexist \nwill be sexist by playing video games. If you look at the most sexist \npeople in the world, I'm sure that all the members of ISIS all love their \nPlaystation 4s. Oh wait, that's right. They don't play video games. How \nabout the gangsta rappers? Oh wait, they don't really play that much. If \nthey did play, it wouldn't affect much of their attitudes, because they \nwere already raised in a household and had sexism promoted by rap culture. \n\nSexism is a function of age and education, not the ability of playing video \ngames. Someone who is older will be more sexist and those who have less \nthan a high school education will also be more sexist. \n\nTranslation: Suck a fat chode, suck it long, suck it hard. The only people \nwho will be sexist after playing video games would be sexist regardless of \nwhether or not they play video games. I'm sorry you're a pathetic loser who \ncan't read further into studies, but one day you might evolve enough to \nunderstand this.

Cultivation theory suggests that long-term \nexposure to media content can affect perceptions of social realities in a\nway that they become more similar to the representations in the media \nand, in turn, impact one's beliefs and attitudes. Previous studies on \nvideo games and cultivation have often been cross-sectional or \nexperimental, and the limited longitudinal work in this area has only \nconsidered time intervals of up to 1 month. Additionally, previous work \nin this area has focused on the effects of violent content and relied on\nself-selected or convenience samples composed mostly of adolescents or \ncollege students. Enlisting a 3 year longitudinal design, the present \nstudy assessed the relationship between video game use and sexist \nattitudes, using data from a representative sample of German players \naged 14 and older (N=824). Controlling for age and education, it was \nfound that sexist attitudes--measured with a brief scale assessing \nbeliefs about gender roles in society--were not related to the amount of\ndaily video game use or preference for specific genres for both female \nand male players. Implications for research on sexism in video games and\ncultivation effects of video games in general are discussed.\"\n\nAbstract of study done 18 April 2015 \n\nTranslation: Suck it long, suck it hard, suck a fat hairy chode.

Again, it's not \nevidence that the games themselves perpetuate misogynism and sexism, but \nthat it happens in these environments. As we can already tell, it's very \nlikely that many sexist individuals play games like CoD, so of course those \nenvironments are going to be toxic. One was about sexism in online video \ngames, the other was about the behavior of women who played games and then \nchose to dress their character in a sexy manner. I have only just skimmed \nthrough them but it seems that the first one found that sexism was \nprevalent and the second one found that women who dressed their characters \nin sexy outfits were more likely to wear sexy outfits themselves and were \nalso more likely to be accepting of rape myth. It's interesting because it \nrelates to the Proteus Effect which is basically that while you're under a \ncertain identity online, you will think like that identity and you will \nbehave like it too. It's basically that we all have different opinions \ndepending on whether or not we're fully anonymous or not. If this means \nthat the women will then go on with their lives and be more accepting to \nrape myth is another question entirely. What they have shown is that if you \nsexualize and objectify yourself, you're going to start thinking of \nyourself like a sexualized object.\n\nThis is all very interesting, but nothing is conclusive and there's just \ntoo little data to make any sweeping statements. Anita is not using the \nright methods to get her points across. What we know is that there is some \nsexism, that mirrors society, in games but we don't properly know how this \nactually affects the gamers.

If anything this would indicate that \nsex is not normalized, but rather that our brains are very good at using \ninformation acquired in the short term to process the world around us.\n\nThe second study also doesn't show that playing video games makes \nobjectification more prevalent. What it shows is that humans will use \nanother person's appearance to determine how they are as a person.\n\nI've skimmed through the last one a bit more and it's similar to the second \none in that it features pictures of men and women. It's actually the only \none that is somewhat relevant. It's a shame she could only manage to \ninclude one relevant study in her sources, and it's only slightly relevant. \nAnyhow, this study asked the participants to read a story where a man \nsexually harasses a woman. Interestingly, men who had seen women, in \nphotos, wearing sexual outfits were more accepting to the harassment than \nthe control group, while women who were exposed to the same material were \nless accepting than the control group. What's even more interesting is that \nthe people who played many hours a week of violent video games were even \nless inclined to have negative reactions to the sexual harassment. But! \nThis only applied to gamers who played lots of violent video games. It begs \nthe question. Is this causation or correlation? We all know what types of \nguys play CoD for example. Those types of games may be drawing that kind of \nattention.\n\nOn the subject of whether or not it's conclusive, here is a quote from the \nstudy:\n\nAlthough more complex models did not indicate significant effects of \nlong-term exposure to video game violence, simpler correlational analyses \ndid reveal significant relationships between long-term violent video game \nexposure and less progressive sexual harassment judgments and greater rape \nsupportive attitudes. These correlations are similar to those reported in \nearlier research (Dill, 2008). It may be that the checklist measure of \nlong-term video game violence exposure used here is a weaker measure than \nthe game-listing version used in a variety of other investigations. \nFurthermore, there is a difference between the still images used in the \nexperimental manipulation and the live action game content that the \nlong-term measure represents. While these results add to the very small \nliterature correlating long-term exposure to video game violence with \nattitudes supporting violence against women, more research is needed to \nelucidate these relationships.\n\nI might have nerded out a bit too much on this. But the researchers said \nthemselves that only simple models showed a correlation, not that there was \nany causation involved. They say themselves that more research is needed.\n\nedit: a word"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnAYHPn2F2tmHj1DBKR6hhQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Silverizael", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12qd1whts3idxwsc22bjr55jqbisdqrt04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-05T20:39:10.826Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnAYHPn2F2tmHj1DBKR6hhQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.17553200000000002, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-05T20:39:10.826Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108708059854678884465", "textDisplay": "+No0bT4rD It seems to me they were specifically relevant, since they were \ninvestigating whether exposure to objectified images and images depicting \nsexism change a person's mental state or otherwise change their opinions \ndue to the exposure.

If there is no link between sexism and \nviolence, then you can't get people to donate to your kickstarter, see?  \nPerhaps you should understand your side of the argument before you start \ndefending it. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12bydjh1xn3xtg3e22vwzk5ytb4dfenh": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4gQE9Ay60JCyWGRMupXFdg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cBZquSKvik8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/9LV6Xp-vIZg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Allthings everythingnow", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-21T06:29:46.616Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC4gQE9Ay60JCyWGRMupXFdg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99307434999999999, "formal_score": 50, "updatedAt": "2014-09-21T06:29:46.616Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110410488271451796704", "textDisplay": "allthingseverythingnow.weebly.comallthingseverythingnow.weebly.com\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12kt1wojkbvtrtny22te5dr4uavytask": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrAn6dHFaDrOCYH6Fsegkdw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TonyKingOfTheOzone", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-23T21:57:50.262Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrAn6dHFaDrOCYH6Fsegkdw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.095207999999999959, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-23T21:57:50.262Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100935104631456556480", "textDisplay": "get cancer please\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12jvhqgfqvtyff3m22xwlqjzom0xx5t5": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYBoI7MiRHSt8MJWU0lMnyw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_u0X4pu5nUg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFU/RMjTCNg5Pnc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Commander Kruge", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-27T20:17:43.477Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCYBoI7MiRHSt8MJWU0lMnyw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99999811590299992, "formal_score": 98, "updatedAt": "2014-09-27T20:17:43.477Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109122877030360869035", "textDisplay": "Yay - whiny gamergater comments!\n\n*gets popcorn*\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12qebwwilesjr3ir04cgdjrxzqedzsyquw0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 7, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNXxJnImVgAMXMeOfSZpOVA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EQTjPVJrey0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/YevS5c5Ip8s/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "LynneSkysong", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-21T02:28:24.791Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNXxJnImVgAMXMeOfSZpOVA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.076017999999999974, "formal_score": 10, "updatedAt": "2014-09-21T02:28:24.791Z", "likeCount": 34, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108535368192841612887", "textDisplay": "I can't believe I've heard so much of your stuff without being subscribed \nto your channel.

They're still under the same \ncategory of critics who wish to censor video games through deception and \ndemonization. That was the point. There is also very little difference \nbetween calling to control video games and using shaming and propaganda \ntactics to do the same. Hiding behind the \"it's just innocent criticism\" \nexcuse is rather weak when an obvious agenda is being shown.\n\nAs for your studies, they're quite hilarious. One claims \"sexist\" games to \ninclude Mario Kart and Halo, while another infers sexism of the player by \ngaming preference and uses a questionnaire as evidence. These kinds of \nagenda papers were published all the time over the years trying to link \nvideo games with everything from violent behavior to doing poorly in school \nto autism.

Jack Thompson, whose main beef was with violence, was pushing for \nlegislation that banned certain games. \nFor instance: \nhttp://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/89178-Jack-Thompson-Authored-Game-Bill-Introduced-In-Utah\n\nI was against Jack Thompson. I was making YouTube videos back in 2006 \nagainst Jack Thompson. He was an asshole. (This is embarrassing, but here's \nan example: http://youtu.be/BfBgkFMDvts?t=8m26s)\n\nAnita is calling for no such ban. No one I know of is calling for a ban on \ngames that contain sexist tropes. No one. \n\nIn fact, Anita says, \"You can enjoy these games and still be critical of \nsome of their more problematic aspects.\"\n\nSo, for instance, I think Rockstar games are amazing. I think the sexist \ntropes they contain are harmful and stupid. I don't think any video game \nshould be banned. Easy peasy. \n\nHence, the debate around sexism and violence are inherently different. \nThat's why conflating the two issues was disingenuous. \n2. Tropes by definition limit choice: They're the same thing over and over. \nMore of the same tropes = more of the same shit. Less tropes = more choice. \nLess tropes does not mean no tropes. \n\nLess tropes = There's still some tropes + but there's also everything else.\n\n3. What Anita actually says is that sexist video games reinforce harmful \nmyths about women. This is very, very, very much not the same as saying \nvideo games cause sexism. \n\nBut since you brought it up, here's 6 studies that show that playing games \nwith sexist tropes negatively effects views of women: \n\nhttp://psychology.okstate.edu/faculty/mburkley/Melissa_Burkley,_Ph.D._Social_Cognition_Lab/Publications_files/PPMC.pdf\nhttp://psychology.okstate.edu/faculty/mburkley/Melissa_Burkley,_Ph.D._Social_Cognition_Lab/Publications_files/PPMC.pdf\nhttp://www.academia.edu/1865189/The_Effects_of_the_Sexualization_of_Female_Video_Game_Characters_on_Gender_Stereotyping_and_Female_Self-Concept\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9695-4/fulltext.html\nhttp://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2009/fox-sr-virgins-vamps.pdf\nhttp://my.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/30298/dill-et-al-jesp-2008.pdf\n\n4.

People will be however society molded them to be. \n\nAnd these kinds of POV's will just mold society into a 10x more toxic one \nthan we have right now.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13itjez5x35ufeii04ce5vjio25h5hp0so0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQIX82jCJ4qrKWZ6rvy_8_A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ctgmHxmRyeU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXc/l2iyRfMpp90/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "The Rt Hon Dennis Skinner MP", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-24T20:22:29.281Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQIX82jCJ4qrKWZ6rvy_8_A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.66719200000000001, "formal_score": 42, "updatedAt": "2014-09-24T20:22:29.281Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111254704429478000229", "textDisplay": "This is intellectually erroneous and artistically inept.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13jclvhpyquhp4iy04ccngqrmywytkbpqk0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAPsIDXdaeUDOV977r09nOA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 4.4943820224719104, "authorDisplayName": "themiddleman009", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-26T00:06:29.454Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCAPsIDXdaeUDOV977r09nOA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.92622629999999995, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-26T00:06:29.454Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108067841743172894695", "textDisplay": "You asshole I was triggered by your video fucking shit sandwich.

Oprah belongs to one of many diverse genres \nof television, some of which are female oriented, and some that are male \noriented. In my opinion, and the opinion of many of gaming's feminist \ncritics, the reason men aren't watching shows like Oprah is because Oprah \nisn't interesting to them, and they have a lot of other television shows \nthat are more geared toward their demographic that can be watched instead.\n\nGaming is unlike this, because in gaming as it currently stands, if a woman \nisn't interested in playing hyper-violent masculine fantasies where women \nare treated as sex objects, there are very few places they can turn \ninstead. On top of this, the females that DO put up with these games often \nhave to deal with males harassing them online and in real life. If I watch \nOprah I don't have to worry about being sent angry or creepy comments by \nguys online, or hear them tell me to make them a sandwich over in-game \nvoice chat."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHQZ9cAUF0TeIA3QsxdOh9Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheSeriousMofo", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13bftk5avnripld322qjpzwlmqqez3wb04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T12:16:16.059Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCHQZ9cAUF0TeIA3QsxdOh9Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.19519400000000003, "formal_score": 41, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T12:16:16.059Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112639018088437527007", "textDisplay": "Well please explain it to me, then.

If video games are not \nimpacting gamers and causing them to become 'racist, mysogynistic or \nhomophobic', then who cares? Who cares if they show girls with physics'ed \noversized boobs, or impossible human physiques (both males and females \nalike)? Who cares if some games are gory, violent or scary or similarly \ndistasteful (oh, I don't know, ... like showing men dying my the hundreds) \nGRANTED that they do not make people into racists, misogynists, homophobics \n(and while we are at it, lets add murderers, stupid, and liars too)? If you \nwere actually right in your assertion that 'nobody claimed [video games] \nmade you sexist, racist or homophobic' (which you are not,... sorry to \nburst your bubble, but that is pretty much the premise of the video series \nin question) , then you are wronger than wrong: You are not only arguing a \npoint which is certifiably wrong (your assertion is in conflict with the \nvery source in which you are quoting), but you are also defending a moot \nand very flawed premise, posed by someone that used the word 'patriarchy in \nwestern culture' in a sentence (without evidence to support this supposed \n\"patriarchy's\" existence; Which apparently Jonathan Mann thinks it is fair \nthat feministfrequency does not need to cite sources or actually address \nthe data or address scrutiny of their claims of the fabled western \npatriarchy (which would be something I for one would love to see actually \nproven, god knows I have heard it claimed to be real as much as aliens and \nBigfoot), whereas the video referenced and mocked here apparently is \nlacking in the ways in which they present pertinent data and 'the sources' \nthey cite? Wow ... almost unbelievable how much hypocrisy is there, but I \ndigress...)\n\n\nI especially liked how you just glazed over these pretty evident facts and \nreplaced what could have been (granted, a continued) valid critique, with a \nguitar solo... Then again, why should I expect less from a song and dance \nto try and discredit a valid and well put together argument.\n\nThen the end with the tweets... it is almost like you have never been to \nthe internet before; To judge any group based on anonymous and hurtful \ntweets, forums posts, or comments is just lunacy. Grow up, and grow a \nlittle thick skin like a big boy... people talk shit on the internet and in \nreal life, I'm sorry to break it to you; I don't think it is especially \nfair or nice, but neither are many things in life that you got to just get \nover. EVEN STILL, thin skin aside, Who is to say that the people that state \nsuch agreeably horrific things actually hold those viewpoints and are not \njust trolling or adding to fire intentionally (or just old fashioned sexist \nor wrong about their viewpoint)... or more maliciously, posted by the \nvictim to progress a radical feminist ideologies (like the tweet displayed \nat 3:55 , this tweet's authenticity is widely debated and there is \ncircumstantial evidence that it was authored by the victim of the \"pole \nrape threat\") , WHY DO YOU WISH TO LABEL (as you did in the manner in which \nyou posted the tweets as the other video was talking about 'all gamers') \nALL GAMERS AS MISOGYNISTS BECAUSE OF ANONYMOUS POSTS ON THE INTERNET? \nThat... takes the cake of dumb.\n\nAnd lastly, (2:52) Boohoo... you want more choices in video games that what \nis already offered to you. That's like saying you want more water while \ndrowning in the ocean... The video game market is extremely flooded by all \nsorts of games MOST ALL OF WHICH ARE NOT CONSIDERED SEXIST BY ANY RATIONAL \nPERSON! And there is more coming every single day! If you can't find any \nnon-sexist games to play (barring you don't find tetris to be phallic and \nmisogynist), then you ... well...  that actually is pretty... well... \nHonestly, I am speechless,... such stupidity is on a frequency that only \ndogs can hear.... perhaps dare I even say,... a feminist frequency?\n\nTHEY ARE JUST GAMES PEOPLE,... THEY DON'T CHANGE YOU INTO SOME SORT OF \nKILLING MONSTER BECAUSE YOU PLAYED AN FPS OR A FIGHTER PILOT BECAUSE YOU \nPLAYED A BULLET HELL OR A MISOGYNIST BECAUSE YOU SAVED A PRINCESS ... THEY \nARE MEANT TO BE FUN AND ENTERTAINING, AND IF THEY ARE NOT, THEN DON'T BUY \nTHEM OR FIND A DIFFERENT HOBBY.

The other thing it can amount to is cherry-picking. \nTake the next step, and realize beyond this attempt at humor, that examples \nare out there throughout gaming (or all) history where things are quite \ndifferent than the feminist narrative. False equivalencies pointed out in \nSommers' video, for example, aren't of her own making, but directly \naddressing the ones \"feminism\" often hides behind as a movement -- it's \nthey who often put what you call unlike things together, some even going so \nfar to claim misogyny *is* violence, that emotional attack *is* \"emotional\" \nviolence, that sex is violence by its very nature (i.e. Dworkin's response \nto the Marquis De Sade art style), now applied to pop culture as a whole; \nfeminist claims, all, so should they not be addressed directly? -- along \nwith manipulated statistics and emotional subversion? On more direct lines, \ntoo, pointing out how roundly the violence in games debate fell apart under \nreal-world conditions offers a solid correlation and note of comparison to \nsexism in games, if taking the stance they are systematized and \ninstitutional. As does the patriarchy, institutional misogyny, and so on... \nIt doesn't help the general confusion when the person in question, for this \nvideo response, is herself a feminist from an earlier phase of its \nprogression, who's not only seen the folly in it as time goes on, but \nwitnessed these same contentions being used repeatedly to gain footholds \ninto people's thought-processes. It's done in the manner of idealogues \nfalling to utter lunacy, paranoia, and hidden agenda, rather than for the \nsake of cogent argument and *actual* justice. If even a shred of merit \ncould be found behind why she'd come to that perspective, a refutation in \nthis style doesn't much add to the discussion she raises, and seems only \ndesigned for speaking to and/or validating the already established thoughts \nof said idealogues. \n\nThere's even an equally funny rebuttal done as a song simply refuting this \nfundamental claim of low/poor representation in gaming, by way of actually \nlisting, illustrating, and describing the history of why there is a \ncontrary viewpoint with undeniable examples -- some of them boldly fly in \nthe face of claims made on Feminist Frequency, in fact, as if thinking no \none would bother to just look through a catalogue of influential game \ncharacters against how they were being portrayed under some sexist \nmicroscope... she's like a sexism-seeking missile, except in light of such \nfacts, seems to have a been miscalibrated somehow. She's seen it where it \nis not; profited from non-thought; escalated detraction from anger to rage \nthen claimed victimization, all with a focus on outliers and those who'd be \nsick under any arrangement. Sommers was being very broad in carrying out an \nintroductory discussion from an outsider's perspective, instead. Go \nfurther. It gets beyond Anita. Literally nothing Anita says is objectively, \nquantifiably true... upon reflection, with her patterns of blatant \ndishonesty clear to anyone who cares about the nature of truth (where a \nliar often wraps things in true-seeming points to cover a malicious \nagenda), and in her appealing what amounts to only a very individualistic, \nsubjective, emotionally rather than fact-driven argument, her's is a \npattern often repeated throughout the hard-line of feminism -- who, mind \nyou, can be just a vile, hateful, mean-spirited, shaming, and violence \nprone as any other types; also, such examples show nothing unusual (because \nall humans are predatory animals built with deep-seated energies made for \nhunting and opportunism), released in arguably unhealthy/unproductive ways \nthrough these new mediums we're still trying to work out in our shared \nsociety. You may not personally have ever been a victim of female on male \nviolence, harassment, sexual abuse, bullying, etc., at least on your own \nterms or any combination not considered the understood and accepted norms \n(as if a norm equals only; as if unclear equals unreal), but many of us \nhave, some look this mindless, un-empathetic downplaying of such things \nright in the face whenever they are presented in blanketed and absolutist \nfashion, and many more of us are quite capable of sifting through examples \nor stats taken in aggregate and out of context for the sheer purposes of \nmanipulation, control, and taking through unjust means; something \nreflective of an abusive relationship, itself, in fact, as a mentality, \nexcept in this case on a societal scale.\n\nIt isn't easy, thinking and searching, but can't/shouldn't just be handed \naway, seen lightly, or taken in stride if unwilling to leave a chosen or \nimmediate comfort zone -- if recognition doesn't extend beyond the self, or \nthe alike to self. For a changing era involving all sorts of shifting \ndynamics to human nature, it's not a flag to hold up when the worst aspects \nof us come into direct conflict without aim, understanding, or release, but \na symptom, and one that I think is being wholly misunderstood and \nde-contextualized using a founding principle lacking reason or wisdom, here \n-- it's that \"shifting goal-post,\" selfish emotional plea speaking to \nselfishness, hold up the least common denominator to distract from internal \nflaws in the original, suppress dissent, shame detractors in-kind, slip in \nideological constructs to actually steal more power and influence while \nothers aren't looking, thing, exactly -- all this amounts to is the \ntextbook of feminist debate, where just beneath the surface is a sea of \nlarger falsehoods, half-truths, and twisting of whatever's left; \"new boss \nsame as the old boss\" in a struggle for power and control where everyone \nultimately loses. If you start searching, you'll probably find arguments \nthat are invalid to sort through, all over, but by now many of the ones \nwith actual legwork behind them should be fairly known and attainable... \nsome of the most compelling seem to indicate there is a greater pattern to \nthese flaws, of which even feminists are victims of through the strange \nmental processes behind its philosophy. If they are categorically victims \nof anything, in the end, it is themselves.\n\nLuckily, \"nothing is a pure edifice...\" and any conscious point of view is \nworth its chance for expression, but our internal and external \nreevaluations should never cease. When they do, new thought could take a \njump-start and a couple of shocks to get going again. To me, it's as simple \nas that, like the \"isms\" of painting where the greatest are those who not \nonly can apply the brush with skill, but have the eye to know when to stop, \nwhich many must practice to learn innately and many more must have a \nsecond, conflicting voice to ever understand. \n\nThat's why she makes a focal point, because she acts as a case-study. \nThat's why she's fuel for the anger of the less articulate, whether \nverbally or emotionally. That's why -- the examples almost too endless to \ncount -- she's seen as a blatant con-artist, both financially and as one \npushing an errant, destructive, thought-manipulating agenda. Is she a \npuppet? Is she a figurehead? Who can say... what seems clear, is that no \nfaction of a cause in history has genuinely benefited from brushing off and \nsmashing its counter-points or critiques over the long-term, something all \nsides could certainly learn from in this and many other issues; but the \narguments and example *are* out there to be weighed, processed, and \ninternalized into a critically thought-out decision of choice. We, no one, \nshows wisdom with a shrug and a laugh toward the disagreeable and not \nself-matching point of view, but especially toward what could be objective \nevidence that is measurable, tangible, and unflinching against scrutiny -- \nit just demands real scrutiny, which this is not. The false statistics \noften used elsewhere are not, because in the reverse they don't stand, but \nneither does a break-down of semantics that amount to nothing. Deeper \ninvestigation holds up on the side against Anita, and it falls apart almost \nimmediately on the side for her, for feminism, and beyond; except for where \nactual dishonesty and appeals of feeling have turned supporters into \nzealots not even desiring any truth which opposes them. Indeed, feminism \nseems more like a religion than a movement, in that regard. Never follow a \nherd for the sheer sake of belonging, image, and \"looking good\" or \nrighteous on your surface as a person. Fitting in's not worth it. Be \nadaptable, and ready to change. This advice goes out to all true \nindividuals.  \n\nI don't think there's a \"bad guy\" in everything to do with life, if good \nand bad's even really understandable beyond our singular and transitory \nexperiences... even you... but finding this, I must say, I think it's \nSommers who's just won my subscription and support. At the very least, \nthough I can rightly say I've never seen anyone who I fully agree with on \nall subjects, she seems well-meaning. I'll be looking forward to browsing \nold discussions, and seeing what else she brings to the table, in future. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12sy1ia3ky1u5if2221j5pi2xruuj3mp": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvxN0B5Uo1SR4NoGrrwOEA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6LjwGOlFLL0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC4/2F6c_ZPRidI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "KVPD", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-06T07:12:13.379Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCyvxN0B5Uo1SR4NoGrrwOEA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8619578, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-10-06T07:12:13.379Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101443057271299031939", "textDisplay": "Feminists are now attacking feminists.\n\nNo wait, AS is calling on her \"army\" to attack anyone who disagrees with \nher opinions.

There is this thing \ncalled \"philosophy\" which Sommers has a PhD in and I'm currently studying \nin that deal with this area.\n\nSommers' pursuit is to show that there is no reason to believe that video \ngames are sexist, and to show that video games aren't predominantly female. \nYour early quip about her including something not in her video title is \nasinine and equally applies to you, and it also ignores the fact that when \ntalking about representation and fairness one needs to look at how big the \ndemographics are, since it is unreasonable to gripe about \"why aren't \nprotagonists 50% male and 50% female?\" if the females only represent 10% of \nthe population (exaggerating). The representation should be proportional, \nwhich if you wish to deny this you also have to undermine the entire reason \npeople spout the \"women are the majority of gamers!!1!\" tirade. You also \ndon't realize that representation is a bit more complicated than just male \nor female, since people can feel represented by people of the opposite \ngender.\n\nHer point of talking about violence is an argument from analogy, and guess \nwhat? It works well, since they both would work off the idea of fantasy \ncausing differing behavior in people, which has never been established for \nthese negative areas, but have rather been correlated with positive things. \nYou also don't seem to get that violence and misogyny would be related. If \nvideo games cause misogyny, then one could expect and increase in violence \nor mistreatment to women.\n\n@ 1:39\nSee, this is why you shouldn't talk about a field you know nothing about. \nAn ad hom is saying that a person or argument is wrong for irrelevant facts \nabout the person which would include insults, but the key thing is the \n\"wrong\" part about that definition. Sommers did not say \"these people are \nwrong, because they are hipsters and have gender studies degrees,\" but \nrather gave a snide remark to show their influences.\n\n\n@ 2:25\nHow much is \"a few\"? You need actual quantification to not be fallacious \nhere. The funny thing is though that Sommers only needs \"a few\" instances \nto say that games are inclusive, and it's pretty simple quantification in \npredicate logic to show that.\n\n\n@2:35\nThe funny thing about tropes is that you don't need that many examples to \nconsider something a trope. So one can easily make anything a trope, which \nis why I use the \"beaten and maimed male\" trope, and \"striped and shamed \nmale\" trope to point out the sexism in media surrounding men (/sarcasm). \nBut honestly, one can do the same thing anita does for men and call games \nsexist against men. Examples of scantily clad males? Plenty of those. \nExamples of same exact male protagonist archetypes throughout games? Plenty \nof that. Examples of males being killed, maimed, beaten, and/or injured? I \ndon't think I need to say it.\n\n\n@ 2:54\nNo, you moron. And what Sommers said ties back into why she pulled out the \nactual numbers of female gamers. A game having a male hero does not make it \nsexist, and a game having sexy women does not make it sexist. The latter \nwould actually be hateful to women, since you are limiting what women can \nbe culturally if you say they can't ever be \"sexy.\"\n\n\n@ 2:57\nNo. She is saying most men like to play as a male character and most men \nlike women. That's about as a safe a statement one could make.\n\n\n@ 3:05\nThis is what I don't get about you people. Why is \"more choice\" seemingly \nthe most important thing to you? My important thing in gaming is having fun \ngames, which as a transgender and gay individual do not need a character \nthat is like me to have fun.\n\n\n@ 3:27\nNo. It's an argument from analogy that shows the hypocrisy and false sense \nof logic these people display. There is no reason to put male quotas on \nthings women like, since males aren't the target demographic. The same is \ntrue of male targeted things, and I believe one can use telos to help \nillustrate.\n\n\n@ 3:55\nAnd then you cherrypick, and not well at that, since non of those people \nare describing themselves as gamers. For all you know, none of them are \ngamers, which means you showed a bunch of assholes with no tie to what you \nare saying. Also, this isn't necessarily sexism, because these people can \nhate anita for her actions and not her gender.

And ultimately, public perception matters, because it will \naffect the future development of games and their sales. Games and game \ndevelopers will do better if their public profile is more positive.\n\n\"Fucking games. Video games aren't some shitty social commentary, they're \nsupposed to be something to do in your spare time.\"\n\nI'm getting tired of debating with people who won't employ their brain for \nfive seconds and who don't understand how media works, but I'll try and \nbreak this down for you: all media, interactive or otherwise, makes some \nkind of statement on society. If it doesn't actively take up a position, \nthen it tacitly supports the status quo. But it's not even the case that \nall games avoid taking up a position - many of them actively promote \ncertain values and ideas. It's right to examine what these are.\n\nIf you think your views of the world are not affected by what you consume, \nthen you're likely more strongly affected than someone who realises what \nideas are being pushed on them.\n\nI realise it's nice and cosy and simple for you to believe games are \nsomehow removed form all of this, are pure escapism, but frankly, that's \nbollocks, and everyone capable of and willing to apply some intelligent \nthought knows that.\n\n\"Games are supposed to be fucking hobbies.\"\n\nThey're not 'supposed' to be anything. You think gaming started in arcades? \nPeople have been playing games for centuries. They've always performed a \nsocial function. Heck, 'hobbies' have a social function.\n\n\"If anything, you're the one with the problem here.\"\n\nNope. You know what I do? I play games and then I discuss them and read \naround them. I enjoy the commentary and the criticism. I engage with other \npeople outside of gaming about them. I *like* the way the games industry is \ngoing, the way more of this is happening.\n\nIt's people like you who are getting censorious and threatening because you \ncan't stand the fact that other people like talking about games, the things \nthey promote and the implications. Gamergate cryhards couldn't just let \nother people get on with it - they feel the need to try to force other \npeople out of games, like the lad I was replying to above.\n\n\"You care way too much about the opinions of people you don't know, and \nwill probably never affect you in your life.\"\n\nNo, I don't care 'way too much' - I care because I like engaging with other \npeople's opinions and discussing things with them.

Hopefully, this will help you folk.\n\nMost gamers don't have a problem discussing women in video games.  The \nthing is, in order for a discussion or debate to happen, the conversation's \ngotta flow both ways.  Anita Sarkeesian and her ilk don't allow comments on \ntheir videos.  They don't allow ratings.  And they don't address actual \ncriticism that's been thrown their way (of which, there is much).  THe \nthing is, the majority of their criticism isn't even against their \nMESSAGE.  It's against their MO.  It's against their methods of how they \nget the message OUT.  And in an oddly circular sense, the criticism about \nthem not being able to take criticism is probably the biggest beast to \ntackle. \n\nYes, they get harassment.  You know who else gets harassment?  Fucking \nEVERYONE.  You put your idea in the public square.  That means, you gotta \nput on your big girl pants and take the verbal slings and arrows that come \nyour way.  Because a good idea stands on its own merit.  You shouldn't have \nto prop it up, by silencing its dejectors.  Also, while you're doing that, \nmake sure that you're trying to actually give suggestions to BETTER the \nindustry, rather than just pointing out the flaws.  How about pointing out \nsome of the PROGRESS we've had over the past 30 years??  How about helping \nout females who wanna get into the industry.  Oh, wait.  That was #Gamergate.  \nYeah, we did that.  It's amazing how quiet you lot get whenever anyone \nbrings up the Fine Young Capitalists (of which, I myself am a donor).  You \nall gave $150,000 to hear a woman complain about video games.  We gave \n$65,000 to get a group of women to fucking DO something about it. \n\nThe other thing GameGate wants is for journalists to stop with the chumming \naround with developers.  I recall seeing a video with a journalism lawyer \nexplicitly lay out that fraternizing with developers, in either a friendly \nor sexual manner in ANY sense would be a gross violation of journalistic \nintegrity.  If they'd have just come out and apologized for this in the \nfirst place, we wouldn't be here.  Instead, they circled the wagons and \nattacked their own demographic.  I know they wanna say that women make up \n53% of video games now, but not in the sense that you think.  They play the \n\"time syncs\" mainly.  Your Farmvilles.  Your Angry Birds.  As for the \nactual storyline games?  The RPGs? The action games and shooters?  The \ncommunity hubs?  Yeah, that's still prodominantly guys.

Anita Sarkeesian's whole \nargument centres around the idea that video games cause sexism like the \nidea that video games cause violence. Case in point, Sarkeesian herself \nisn't even a fucking gamer, yet she feels the has the right to come into \nour house and shit everywhere simply because she is a female. Seriously. \nWho were we hurting? According to statistics on violent games, not many. \n\nThe main reason why this isn't the case is because games are fantasies they \nare little enclosed worlds in which you can do whatever you want. You \naren't held back by anything. Because games are fantasy characters also do \nnot have to reflect reality you can have an attractive girl with big tits \nbouncing around (I.e Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball) because, rather \nsurprisingly, guys like watching girls with big tits bounce around because \nsexuality just happens to be quite a large part of what a human consists \nof. Fucking. Deal with it.  \n\nIt's not sexism and it's not objectification any more than a kid playing \nwith dolls in a house is (Meaning someone drawing entertainment from a play \nthing) because videogame characters aren't real. To even suggest that a \nsomeone who saw a someone in a vieogame would conflate that experience with \nsomeone in real life is retarded.\n\nA game about a group of bland multiracial multicultural group of people \nhalf of which are male half of which are female getting together and \ndiscussing things calmly in separate little booths so that nobody could \nsexualise anybody else would be a fucking boring game. Even if they started \nkilling each other it would be a fucking boring game because these \ncharacters would have nothing of note about them. which is why we have \ninteresting characters like Alex and Bayonetta \n\nWomen are not the target market  for most video-games, I'd personally love \nthat to change because I'm sick of being considered a freak with a dungeon \ntan, but the whole point of marketing is to appeal to people who will \nconsume your product. I'd love to meet women who actually want to \nunderstand me and my favoured media but it just doesn't happen very often. \nGames sell, and they sell because people like them. If you don't like a \nparticular game or the culture in general, feel free to fuck off. \n\nAn Ad Hominem attack is when someone attempts to discredit something \nsomeone has said, Dr Sommers called Sarkeesian a hipster with a social \nstudies degree because that is what she is. It's not an Ad Hominem if \nyou're stating a fact. Go learn what an Ad Hominem is.\n\nYou think video games aren't inclusive? Video games are inclusive. It \ndoesn't matter who you are, nobody gives a fuck what colour you are, or \nwhat sexual organs you have. That is what you'd expect from a culture born \nof social outcasts.\n\nCurrently gamers like me are having to sit by an watch as the games we know \nand love are torn apart by people that don't even understand them. Taking \nthem out of context and generally shitting on them (Case in point \nSarkeesian's video about himan absolution). How exactly you think the \nanalogy of attacking media mainly consumed by females is false equivalence \nis beyond me. \n\nYou want to talk about cherry picking. How about you show a list of \ntrollish internet tweets? Fucking hypocrites man. Fucking hypocrites. \n\nYou will not stand down? That's fine. you think you're making some kind of \nimpact? Nah. To us you are a joke. The simple fact that are are trying and \nfailing to rebuke someone who is far more qualified to talk about this \ntopic than you or Sarkeesian is evidence of this. Oh and by the way, \nevidence is used to support a claim. Perhaps you should work on that.   \n\nYour video was asinine, and frankly cringe worthy. Go piss on some other \ndemographics past time. \n\nLast note. Go fuck yourself. Seriously, take your baseless hipsterish \ncriticisms and fuck yourself with them.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12islwwsmzyyb4cm22dg3rignaddzhz004": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3VQiMbeAGWxCNj2-ri0wg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DqXAoAb3L9A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB8/mLgyUpmTmNY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Michal P", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T20:35:57.374Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-3VQiMbeAGWxCNj2-ri0wg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.34359399999999996, "formal_score": 92, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T20:35:57.374Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118032485583766285523", "textDisplay": "And as a reward to this knight, Anita still hasn't\n sleep with him\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13fc1aoyr3rfxm5a04ccjwodzu4x3cbiws0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjy71GWLb4y7Eig-MgJ423g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MJ2e4SquecI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD4/VKyuUvwqzkk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Supika893", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-22T23:28:40.037Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjy71GWLb4y7Eig-MgJ423g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.55110400000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-22T23:28:40.037Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101124798668866777578", "textDisplay": "If you are girl and don't want to hear sexism/critics about females \nplayers, just stay in the kitchen.

But I can safely say that I am certainly on the side of the \noppressed, and by oppressed I mean: my fellow gamers. The \"OMG SEXISM\" side \nseems to use abusive tweets to them as clear evidence that \"most\" gamers \nare misogynists. No, a select few with barely 2 brain cells to rub together \nlet the team of Gaming Realists down. The Sexism in Gaming people are \nclearly people who aren't aware that the internet is a dangerous place, \nwhere expressing yourself (and your misguided notions) will be open to \nscrutiny and \"trolling\". It's been going on for a long time, but these \nmisguided people think that they have a right not to be scrutinised... \nWRONG!\nThe Feminists of today are a completely different breed to what real \nfeminists are... To be honest I find the word 'feminism' inherently \nexclusive of men and don't see how a movement fighting for one gender is \ngoing to bring equality. I understand the need for it back in the day when \nwomen couldn't vote etc... but now it's done it's job and both sexes and \nall genders need to fight for equality together... But not at the detriment \nof art, media, humour, our rights, free speech, and social media. (The word \nshould be something like 'Equalism' or something along those lines...)\nI find it baffling how so many movies that have rape, or women getting \nbeaten, or the frigging \"damsel in distress trope\" are usually considered \nas art even by women, and not complained about as much as GTA where you can \nalmost do the same things... but it seems that because games are \ninteractive it's worse multiplied by 9001. Games are becoming an art form, \nthey are becoming a staple of modern culture, and most of all... they're \nfun.\n\nHere's a simple thing to remember: No matter what it is, no matter what you \ndo or say, someone out there in that big scary world of \"outside\" is going \nto be offended. And do you know what happens when you get offended? \nNOTHING. You just get offended.\nNot everyone is like these New Neo-Feminists today, so why should the \nmajority of sane, rational, realistic, accepting gamers have their games \nchanged to suit a few misguided morons?\n\nThey should go and make they're own game... Let other people make what they \nwant, you extreme-feminists make what you want, and we'll see how it comes \nout when the sales figures are in.

There are A LOT of \ngames aimed at women, just look at any app store.

While willful or otherwise \nignoring the massive log of games aimed at women.\nIt's like complaining magazines are aimed at men pointing towards car and \nsport magazines and forgetting fashion and gossip magazines exist. \n\n\"And there ARE a whole lot of women interested in programming and heavy \nmath and there always have been.\"\nThan why are less women (generally 1 in 3, far less in gaming) into \nprogramming? Or for that matter is math (and subjects tat require a lot of \nmath) generally the most hated subject of women?\n\n\"Before 1980 women were paving the way for future developers for software \nand hardware and they were just as represented in those fields as men.\"\nFunny you bring that up, considering I occasionally gave talks about the \nhistory of computing.\nYes a lot of early BUSINESS computing was done by women before the 80's. \nWhy? Because at best it could be used as a secretary device as it was \nbasically a upgraded file sorter. (and in military it still was largely \nmale thing)\nHaving said that, there were actually very little women in the hardware \nside or writing of software side (even less so than now). Although general \nuse was largely female. \nThen in the 80's computers were getting a foothold in the consumer market, \ndue to cost, where it became a thing aimed at doing finances and such \nthings, things generally done by the man in a house hold back then.\n\n\"Would you feel just as included like that was a place for you?\"\nNo, but like I stated before in that situation I wouldn't be the target \naudience. However in that world (where gender of audiences are switched) I \nwould have a comparably equal size of possible games to play aimed at, \nthan, the male gender (which in this case would be largely puzzle and \ndigital novel type games). However I wouldn't have such a massive community \naround it, partly because those genres don't allow it that much.\n\n\"If you complained they'd say, \"shut up you sex negative man go back in the \ngarage and take out the garbage.\"\"\nAs they should, as I'd be saying \"you fandom is wrong because I don't like \nit\".\n\nYou seem to think that there are very little games aimed at women, which is \nstrictly untrue."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGq78-LyD0m5_gfsheOtJqw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "sinistar99", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12yxtfrxqumtf2nc220utv5fpv5fzor104", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-24T19:55:32.768Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGq78-LyD0m5_gfsheOtJqw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.47622800000000004, "formal_score": 1, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-24T19:55:32.768Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102504315565067568320", "textDisplay": "+relo999 But there are just as many if not more magazines aimed at men. \nYou're making a false equivalency.

In which there is a fair point, if some \npeople are trying this hard to get an industry to change it would seem both \nmore reasonable to try and influence such an industry with new titles which \ndemonstrate the appeal you believe such games would have.\n\nOn a side note, I find it funny that Gone Home is being brought up as a \nnon-sexist game, I actually don't think the actions of the girl the game \nrevolves around, whom ends up stealing from her parents and recklessly \nfleeing the country because of a teenage romance to be all that good a \nportrayal of her gender."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2etgtG64pF2oHcLp1htmA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Derzak", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12hs1qymxzxe1byo04cfxxjjt2lzlwzpvg0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T02:05:19.889Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCS2etgtG64pF2oHcLp1htmA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.80942800000000004, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T02:05:19.889Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VCOjp0w1OMI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHg/fjUu38S83w4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109508693662764550342", "textDisplay": "+BakehousePictures\nSo, correct me for it's late and I might be wrong, but it's criticism when \nyou like it and complaints when you don't?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0RSUVHihymnZLbfehhHm4w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "BakehousePictures", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12hs1qymxzxe1byo04cfxxjjt2lzlwzpvg0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T01:51:53.375Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC0RSUVHihymnZLbfehhHm4w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.79870200000000002, "formal_score": 98, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T01:51:53.375Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vNvowZinzAI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/iw8eDdew19s/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107257817633570863748", "textDisplay": "+Derzak\nThanks for supporting my position, Derzak old pal.

Although a few points, \nif I may: \n\n0:44 - The argument by social justice warriors is that video games are \ninherently sexist, which causes sexism. Video games aren't sexist (proven \nwith the great range and diversity of games) and there is no link between \nvideo games and any kind of negative traits, such as violence, misogyny, \netc. \n\n0:56 - Another SJW argument is that sexist games are keeping women out of \nthe industry/keeping women from playing games. Neither social justice claim \nis correct. \n\n1:06 - She doesn't conflate them, she is merely addressing both issues at \nonce. She never says \"misogyny is violence\" or a woman who was attacked as \nsubjected to misogyny etc. \n\n1:27 - The point is that video games aren't proven to cause anything. \n Neither violence, nor sexism, nor anything at all, really. \n\n1:39 - Jesus man, she didn't actually say that being a hipster with a \ndegree in cultural studies prevented them from giving legitimate criticism, \nwhich *would* be an ad hominem, she merely described that this was \nhappening - and it is. \n\n1:49 - These are \"good question\"s to you because, as you were singing from \nthe rooftops, you are beta as fuck. If you weren't beta as fuck, they'd be \nsilly questions with obvious answers. \n\n2:00 - Fair enough, they haven't made any good points. \n\n2:12 - Don't you think that showing your hate-boner for \"male video game \nculture\" is just absurd here? \n\n2:31 - Ah, we finally come to it. It's got to be AAA games. Despite SJWs \nalways going on about how amazing graphics aren't important, big budgets \naren't important, etc etc, when it comes down to it, you'd ignore \neverything in the entire industry that caters towards women because the big \nbucks that are used to make big flashy games are made to make big flashy \ngames to cater to men, and being \"beta as fuck\" you hate that kind of \nthing.  That explains the previous hate-boner. \n\n2:41 - Great, they're full of sexist tropes. Everyone hears you, nobody's \nbothered. It doesn't hurt anyone, it's just something that hipster culture \ncritics don't like - what a surprise. \n\n2:55 - No, she's saying that hipster cultural critics is a bloody generous \nterm for a bunch of annoying whiners who are fixated on their genitals and \nfirst world problems. \n\n3:03 - You have plenty of choice, but not to choice to censor someone \nelse's art to fit your tastes. \n\n3:14 - THANK YOU!  That's wonderful, SJW admits that none of the things \nthey are complaining about are going to have any real-world impact.  SJWs \nare just annoying whiners! Jonathan Mann confirms it.\n\n3:26 - How is it false equivalence? You want to change the AAA industry to \nsuit feminine tastes.  She's proposing a scenario where gender ideologues \ntarget a woman-centric industry to tailor it to male tastes. It's perfectly \nfine to equivocate these things. \n\n3:45 - Whoa whoa whoa, don't you go asking for data, princess. The gamers \ndon't need to provide data on anything because you fools aren't even making \nany claims.  \"We don't like how women in video games are protrayed\" is \nliterally what you are saying, that's it. She doesn't have to provide \nanything, because you haven't said anything that needs to be disproven and \nthat is YOUR ARGUMENT. \n\n4:10 - Good lord, this is why nobody takes you people seriously. \"There's \nnothing wrong with games, we don't think they cause any problems, except \nmen are enjoying them\" \"well, if they don't cause problems, why not just \nstand down and leave them be?\" \"No! We must meddle! It's our reason for \nexisting! If we can't fuck with someone's hobby then we're bored and \nmiserable, and misery loves company!\"\n\nYou social justice warriors are a joke.

This \nstudy investigated whether video game content differentially influences \naggression as a function of individual differences in trait anger. \nParticipants were randomly assigned to play a violent or nonviolent video \ngame before completing a task in which they could behave aggressively. \nResults showed that participants high in trait anger were the most \naggressive, but only if they first played a VVG.

Journal of Experimental Social \nPsychology, July 2009, Vol. 45(4), 731-739.\n\nAbstract: \u201cThree experiments examined the impact of excessive violence in \nsport video games on aggression-related variables.

Playing an excessively violent \nsports video game increased aggressive affect, aggressive cognition, \naggressive behavior, and attitudes towards violence in sports.

Social Psychological \nand Personality Science, January 2011, Vol. 2(1), 29-32.\nAbstract: \u201cExperimental studies show that violent video games cause people \nto behave more aggressively, but how long does the effect last? In most \nexperiments, aggression is measured immediately after gameplay. The present \nexperiment is the first to test the long-term causal effects of violent \nvideo games on aggression. By the flip of a coin, participants played a \nviolent or nonviolent game for 20 min. Within each group, half ruminated \nabout the game. The next day, participants competed with an ostensible \nopponent on a competitive task in which the winner could punish the loser \nwith painful noise blasts through headphones. Results showed that violent \nvideo games increased aggression 24 hr later, but only among men who \nruminated about the game. Rumination keeps aggressive thoughts, feelings, \nand behavioral tendencies active. If players ruminate about the violence in \na game, the aggression-stimulating effects of the game persist long after \nit has been turned off.\u201d\n- See more at: \nhttp://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/value-violent-video-games-research-roundup#sthash.pUZaQJOL.dpuf\n\n\u201cLongitudinal Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggression in Japan and the \nUnited States\u201d Anderson, Craig A.; Sakamoto, Akira; Gentile, Douglas A.; \nIhori, Nobuko; Shibuya, Akiko; Yukawa, Shintaro; Naito, Mayumi; Kobayashi, \nKumiko. Pediatrics, November 2008, Vol. 122(5), e1067-e1072.\nAbstract: \u201cWe tested whether high exposure to violent video games increases \nphysical aggression over time in both high- (United States) and low- \n(Japan) violence cultures. We hypothesized that the amount of exposure to \nviolent video games early in a school year would predict changes in \nphysical aggressiveness assessed later in the school year, even after \nstatistically controlling for gender and previous physical aggressiveness\u2026. \nHabitual violent video game play early in the school year predicted later \naggression, even after controlling for gender and previous aggressiveness \nin each sample. Those who played a lot of violent video games became \nrelatively more physically aggressive. Multisample structure equation \nmodeling revealed that this longitudinal effect was of a similar magnitude \nin the United States and Japan for similar-aged youth and was smaller (but \nstill significant) in the sample that included older youth\u2026. These \nlongitudinal results confirm earlier experimental and cross-sectional \nstudies that had suggested that playing violent video games is a \nsignificant risk factor for later physically aggressive behavior and that \nthis violent video game effect on youth generalizes across very different \ncultures. As a whole, the research strongly suggests reducing the exposure \nof youth to this risk factor.\u201d\n- See more at: \nhttp://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/value-violent-video-games-research-roundup#sthash.pUZaQJOL.dpuf\n- \n\u201cViolent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy and Prosocial Behavior \nin Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review\u201d Anderson, Craig \nA.; Shibuya, Akiko; Ihori, Nobuko; Swing, Edward L.; Bushman, Brad J.; \nSakamoto, Akira; Rothstein, Hannah R.; Saleem, Muniba. Psychological \nBulletin, March 2010, Vol. 136(2), 151-173.\nAbstract: \u201cMeta-analytic procedures were used to test the effects of \nviolent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, \naggressive affect, physiological arousal, empathy/desensitization, and \nprosocial behavior. Unique features of this meta-analytic review include \n(a) more restrictive methodological quality inclusion criteria than in past \nmeta-analyses; (b) cross-cultural comparisons; (c) longitudinal studies for \nall outcomes except physiological arousal; (d) conservative statistical \ncontrols; (e) multiple moderator analyses; and (f) sensitivity analyses. \nSocial-cognitive models and cultural differences between Japan and Western \ncountries were used to generate theory-based predictions. Meta-analyses \nyielded significant effects for all 6 outcome variables. The pattern of \nresults for different outcomes and research designs (experimental, \ncross-sectional, longitudinal) fit theoretical predictions well. The \nevidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal \nrisk factor for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and \naggressive affect and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. \nModerator analyses revealed significant research design effects, weak \nevidence of cultural differences in susceptibility and type of measurement \neffects, and no evidence of sex differences in susceptibility. Results of \nvarious sensitivity analyses revealed these effects to be robust, with \nlittle evidence of selection (publication) bias.\u201d\n- See more at: \nhttp://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/value-violent-video-games-research-roundup#sthash.pUZaQJOL.dpuf"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCST5HCoxkCmNJXjlHWvb2Kw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "LegoDaleks", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13jdp0bqqbzxlxu422wi1do2qrbzxzle", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-19T19:06:39.969Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCST5HCoxkCmNJXjlHWvb2Kw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.19383799999999995, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-19T19:06:39.969Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kBZwBaoCFZg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFo/GJZyjJ88M-0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112914257912107586967", "textDisplay": "+Jack Daone Your source is called 'the feminist factcheck'.

There are theoretical reasons to believe they can. \nParticipants (N = 151) played a violent shooting game with humanoid targets \nthat rewarded headshots, a nonviolent shooting game with bull\u2019s-eye \ntargets, or a nonviolent nonshooting game. Those who played a shooting game \nused either a pistol-shaped or a standard controller. Next, participants \nshot a realistic gun at a mannequin. Participants who played a violent \nshooting game using a pistol-shaped controller had 99% more headshots and \n33% more other shots than did other participants. These results remained \nsignificant even after controlling for firearm experience, gun attitudes, \nhabitual exposure to violent shooting games, and trait aggressiveness. \nHabitual exposure to violent shooting games also predicted shooting \naccuracy. Thus, playing violent shooting video games can improve firing \naccuracy and can influence players to aim for the head.\u201d\n- See more at: \nhttp://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/value-violent-video-games-research-roundup#sthash.pUZaQJOL.dpuf\n- \n\u201cViolent Video Games Cause an Increase in Aggression Long After the Game \nHas Been Turned Off\u201d Bushman, Brad J.; Gibson, Bryan. Social Psychological \nand Personality Science, January 2011, Vol. 2(1), 29-32.\nAbstract: \u201cExperimental studies show that violent video games cause people \nto behave more aggressively, but how long does the effect last? In most \nexperiments, aggression is measured immediately after gameplay. The present \nexperiment is the first to test the long-term causal effects of violent \nvideo games on aggression. By the flip of a coin, participants played a \nviolent or nonviolent game for 20 min. Within each group, half ruminated \nabout the game. The next day, participants competed with an ostensible \nopponent on a competitive task in which the winner could punish the loser \nwith painful noise blasts through headphones. Results showed that violent \nvideo games increased aggression 24 hr later, but only among men who \nruminated about the game. Rumination keeps aggressive thoughts, feelings, \nand behavioral tendencies active. If players ruminate about the violence in \na game, the aggression-stimulating effects of the game persist long after \nit has been turned off.\u201d\n- See more at: \nhttp://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/value-violent-video-games-research-roundup#sthash.pUZaQJOL.dpuf\n\n\u201cLongitudinal Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggression in Japan and the \nUnited States\u201d Anderson, Craig A.; Sakamoto, Akira; Gentile, Douglas A.; \nIhori, Nobuko; Shibuya, Akiko; Yukawa, Shintaro; Naito, Mayumi; Kobayashi, \nKumiko. Pediatrics, November 2008, Vol. 122(5), e1067-e1072.\nAbstract: \u201cWe tested whether high exposure to violent video games increases \nphysical aggression over time in both high- (United States) and low- \n(Japan) violence cultures. We hypothesized that the amount of exposure to \nviolent video games early in a school year would predict changes in \nphysical aggressiveness assessed later in the school year, even after \nstatistically controlling for gender and previous physical aggressiveness\u2026. \nHabitual violent video game play early in the school year predicted later \naggression, even after controlling for gender and previous aggressiveness \nin each sample. Those who played a lot of violent video games became \nrelatively more physically aggressive. Multisample structure equation \nmodeling revealed that this longitudinal effect was of a similar magnitude \nin the United States and Japan for similar-aged youth and was smaller (but \nstill significant) in the sample that included older youth\u2026. These \nlongitudinal results confirm earlier experimental and cross-sectional \nstudies that had suggested that playing violent video games is a \nsignificant risk factor for later physically aggressive behavior and that \nthis violent video game effect on youth generalizes across very different \ncultures. As a whole, the research strongly suggests reducing the exposure \nof youth to this risk factor.\u201d\n- See more at: \nhttp://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/value-violent-video-games-research-roundup#sthash.pUZaQJOL.dpuf\n- \n\u201cViolent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy and Prosocial Behavior \nin Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review\u201d Anderson, Craig \nA.; Shibuya, Akiko; Ihori, Nobuko; Swing, Edward L.; Bushman, Brad J.; \nSakamoto, Akira; Rothstein, Hannah R.; Saleem, Muniba. Psychological \nBulletin, March 2010, Vol. 136(2), 151-173.\nAbstract: \u201cMeta-analytic procedures were used to test the effects of \nviolent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, \naggressive affect, physiological arousal, empathy/desensitization, and \nprosocial behavior. Unique features of this meta-analytic review include \n(a) more restrictive methodological quality inclusion criteria than in past \nmeta-analyses; (b) cross-cultural comparisons; (c) longitudinal studies for \nall outcomes except physiological arousal; (d) conservative statistical \ncontrols; (e) multiple moderator analyses; and (f) sensitivity analyses. \nSocial-cognitive models and cultural differences between Japan and Western \ncountries were used to generate theory-based predictions. Meta-analyses \nyielded significant effects for all 6 outcome variables. The pattern of \nresults for different outcomes and research designs (experimental, \ncross-sectional, longitudinal) fit theoretical predictions well. The \nevidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal \nrisk factor for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and \naggressive affect and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. \nModerator analyses revealed significant research design effects, weak \nevidence of cultural differences in susceptibility and type of measurement \neffects, and no evidence of sex differences in susceptibility. Results of \nvarious sensitivity analyses revealed these effects to be robust, with \nlittle evidence of selection (publication) bias.\u201d\n- See more at: \nhttp://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/value-violent-video-games-research-roundup#sthash.pUZaQJOL.dpuf"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuK0ScdY9SZ03U_P_6Wa1Uw", "inappropriate_score": 1.7094017094017093, "authorDisplayName": "Jack Daone", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13jdp0bqqbzxlxu422wi1do2qrbzxzle", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-17T03:52:19.400Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuK0ScdY9SZ03U_P_6Wa1Uw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.92286550000000001, "formal_score": 71, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-17T03:54:46.333Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118328272965910596599", "textDisplay": "+LegoDaleks\n&quot;Too bad my notion that video games making people violent and \naggressive has been literally proven the world over.&quot;\n\n*citation needed*\n\nI, meanwhile, have a dearth of sources that disprove your irrational hatred \nof gamers.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@cainejw/the-factual-feminist-a-factcheck-f5ae584f56da\n\nNow, again, fuck your disbarred ass off back to Florida, Jack."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjBbu2iXOc550ugWGl9jQTg", "inappropriate_score": 0.31746031746031744, "authorDisplayName": "Derek Halder", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13jdp0bqqbzxlxu422wi1do2qrbzxzle", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-11-16T22:40:55.337Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjBbu2iXOc550ugWGl9jQTg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.19673999999999997, "formal_score": 94, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-11-16T22:49:30.563Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wpnepXgI3uk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/gVHlRylTfo0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118181646070712469012", "textDisplay": "+LegoDaleks  well one it is not conclusive with aggression either.

I actually get what \nyou're saying and, in fact, I'm a big supporter of Children's Rights, \nmyself.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not sure you really got what I was trying to say. If \nfeminists actually succeed in tearing down the kyriarchy (the larger \nstructure of which patriarchy is a part), it's not just women who stand to \ngain from that, but *everyone* (people of color, cis men, trans men, trans \nwomen, children, the disabled, homosexuals, etc).\n\nI'm taking an Introduction to Evolutionary Psychology right now, and I \ndefinitely agree and accept that there's a lot to be said for trying to \nunderstand the origins of human behavior. I myself am a firm believer that \nthere is nothing truly unique to the human animal other than the scale at \nwhich we do things, and it is through that lens that I am trying to \nunderstand fanaticism (I'm majoring in Anthropology and will probably go on \nto get a degree in Evo Psych for this purpose). The problem is when the \nfindings of Evolutionary Psychology are used to *justify* social inequality.\n\nWomen evolved to be child-bearers while men didn't, so yes, there will be \ndifferences in the evolutionary make-up of men and women. This does not \njustify victim-blaming, men getting harder/more dangerous jobs, women \nmaking less than men, and the general treatment of women as inferior to \nmen. No amount of Evo Psych in the world will justify someone blaming a \nrape victim for getting raped. And frankly, Evo-Psych explanations of \ngender differences tend to be very heteronormative, in that they largely \nignore the existence of people on the LGBTQA spectrum (that is, lesbians, \ngays, bisexuals, trans*, queers, asexuals, etc). And while Evo-Psych \nexplanations of gender differences ignore these people, they cannot be \ngood, comprehensive explanations.\n\nThink of it this way: as a scientific explanation for the origins of the \ncomplexity of life on earth, Neodarwinism is basically perfect (albeit as \nfar as a scientific theory can be perfect). The Theory of Evolution remains \nunchallenged in this area. But what happens when you try to use the Theory \nof Evolution to build a society? Social Darwinism, and even *Richard \nDawkins* is a virulent anti-Social Darwinist... in fact, it would not \nsurprise me to find that Charles Darwin himself would have major issues \nwith the idea of Social Darwinism.\n\nScience cannot inform the social structure of a society, nor can it be used \nto justify inherent societal inequalities. Science is simply the best tool \nwe have to understand the nature of reality, so it can *explain* these \nthings... just not *justify* them. That doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to \nfight social injustices. Feminists (at least the ones I ally myself with) \nare doing just that. In reality, the feminism I subscribe to is very much \nin agreement with MRM grievances *put on paper*, which is why I say, again, \nthat if MRAs actually *did* care about the ways in which society negatively \naffects men, they would be feminists, or at least allies, working to tear \ndown the same social systems that hurt women, because they are the same \nsocial systems hurting men, as well."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWogsEJZD6u_0KlJPDCjv3g", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "mdx95", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z135tpgy2sadz3ghu04cexyozof0hluoiho", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-23T03:44:19.510Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCWogsEJZD6u_0KlJPDCjv3g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8076241999999999, "formal_score": 52, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-23T03:44:43.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pURBZoMF_HI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/GmrZmlT_nBU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102618617699845831532", "textDisplay": "+Nathan Hevenstone +MaxOfS2D You hit the nail on the head.

And to whom are the videogames being sexist \nagainst? Can't a youtube video title be thought provoking launch pad, \nrather than a presentation supporting an argument? Are other ideas not \nallowed to be presented in a thought provoking video? Why do you seem to \nclaim to know what Dr. Christina intended to do with this video? Why does \nshe have to answer the question she chose as a title for her video?\n\n\nThe studies she cited shows that the gaming community is inclusive, as  \nsupported by the findings in that paper. If a community is not inclusive of \na specific demographic for no good reason, then it would indeed be racist, \nhomophobic, sexist et cetera.\n\nThe issue of injustices portrayed in videogames reflecting gamer behaviour \nin real life is being addressed. She brought up violence because this was \nan example of injustices in video games that claimed to have an impact on \ngamers in real life, when studies have shown that this is not the case. \nAlthough this doesn't prove that objectified women in games have no serious \nimpact on people in the real world, it does set a trend.\n\nConcerning: \"...hipster's with degrees in cultural studies\" It would be an \nad hominem attack if she just mentioned the word 'hipsters', but riddicule \naccompanied with addressing critics who seem to have abysmal credentials is \nnot simply an ad hominem attack. By that logic, this entire video is an ad \nhominem attack because you are portraying Dr. Christina in a negative \nlight, even though you have presented some good points.\n\n\"Good questions!\" and \"Please point them out?\". Why? It's her video and she \ncan do what she wants. You again assume that the intention of her video is \nto argue, as opposed to raise questions, take time to think about both \nviewpoints and encourage discussion.\n\nThere are plenty of female protagonists that aren't objectified in AAA \ntitles. That's besides the point. As a man, I don't mind playing as \nunobjectified strong female leads, and that would suggest that other women \nwouldn't mind playing as male protagonists either. Games are art. Don't \ntell people how to make art.\n\nFalse equivalence? It's just an exercise in empathy. Try it some time. \nGamers are human after all despite what some hipster critics say.\n\nThose were some bad tweets.

What's wrong with asking more than one question? Why can't someone \ndiscuss more than one idea?\n2. No, she doesn't answer it. Did she say she would? At the end, she asks \nthe viewer what they think of this controversy, suggesting it's meant to be \nan open question.\n3. Sexism should, in theory, create a hostile environment for women. As \nsuch, the number of women that play games would likely be linked to this. \nIt's reasonable to request more relevant data, but this does address sexism.\n3.1. You may say that sexism would not deter women from playing games, and \nthat people will consume media that degrades them. If you think this to be \nthe case, the it seems that you think women, and to some extent, people in \ngeneral, to be stupid, or lacking in self respect. I would argue that such \na point of view is sexist, and perhaps even misanthropic.\n4. Mentioning two things together doesn't conflate them. Asking if you like \nfish and chips doesn't imply that they are the same, or similar, just that \nthey go together. Since misogyny and violence are the to most major \ncriticism of games in the public eye, the do go together. This is made \nclear when, after mentioning criticism over violence, she then mentions a \n*new* wave of critics, then mentioning misogyny. This creates a clear \ndistinction.\n5. Again, why can't a video mention more than one thing? Violence was the \nold (though it's not gone) criticism of games, sexism is the new one. \nExploration of the former is useful for comparison to the latter.\n6. It's not an ad hominem if it's not a substitute for an actual argument. \nInsulting someone (which that barely even was, btw) and then making your \nargument is in no way fallacious.\n7. Why point them out? The video is clearly a general response.\n8. A few? If you limit it to protagonists, yeah, but that seems kind of \narbitrary. Plenty of games portray a diverse range of characters, including \nfemales. Is it misogynistic that they're mostly male? I'll address that in \npoint 11.\n8.1. This also ignores the number of settings in which it makes sense that \nthere would be no women, or at least none active, as well as the ones in \nwhich the player character is generic, as are the enemies, and the lack of \nfemales is merely to save on character models and voices.\n9. Just about their boobs? Most of the time, it's your decision to see \nthese characters as *just* about their boobs. They have other personality \ntraits that you choose to ignore in order to benefit your own views.\n9.1. Why is it an issue when female characters are sexualized? What is the \nissue with enjoying a woman's body? Later, you claim that nobody said it \nmakes you sexist, so what is the negative effect? The most common response \nis that it portrays sexism, but I don't see how it's sexist. Even if you \nwant to class these characters as sex objects, (which is often a gross \nmischaracterization, and as mentioned above, your choice), so what? \nLiterally every character in video games is an object for your \nentertainment. Why is this special?\n10. I don't agree that they are full of sexist tropes. At least not played \nstraight. Most of the examples I've seen are deliberate attempts to read \nsexism into games where they don't exist. i.e. Anita Sarkeesian read the \nsexism into the scene in Watch_Dogs where you rescue women being sex \ntrafficked. You were saving them from criminals; them being on display was \nclearly meant to evoke disgust. It's clearly a message against the \nexploitation of women. That's not sexist.\n11. Catering to a demographic is sexist? How? How is it sexist to let \npeople do what they want? Look at hidden object games, which contain mostly \nfemale protagonists. Why? Because mostly women play them. Is that sexist? I \ndon't think so. Like 11, it's just playing to your demographic. You can't \ncome to a business as a minority, and expect equal supply, as you don't \ngenerate equal demand. Demand is proportionate to supply.\n11.1. Equating what she said to \"video games are sexist, and boys will be \nboys\" is a straw man. Please explain how her statement leads to that.\n12. Fair enough, nobody said that. Even as someone who opposes your side of \nthe argument, I have to admit, that point irks me, as it is an assumption \nof your position.\n13. How is it false equivalence? The first thing that comes to mind as a \npossible answer is that Oprah isn't the entirety, or majority, of \nmainstream television. Neither are AAA games. Casual games are huge, and \nindie games are a lot bigger than they used to be. See the hidden object \ngame example in 11.\n14. Congratulations, you found hate on the internet. You can do that for \nany group. Muslims, Christians, Jews, black people, white people, and even \nfeminists. Just look at the KYM photo list for gamergate for that. Would \nyou use those to imply anything negative about those groups?\nAnd before you call any/all of those isolated incidents, please explain why \nthe examples you gave were not.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z135shhrnkuahfexx04chpzwfyugvfswchc": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDyNcj6mD2UQHIqFL5Gj38w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HtYUp2KuHs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAfRk/aZpwkRHQTWQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "peter sodja", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-01-19T13:53:54.186Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDyNcj6mD2UQHIqFL5Gj38w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99937646300000005, "formal_score": 14, "updatedAt": "2015-01-19T13:53:54.186Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115183531666808796704", "textDisplay": "What a great video!

I don't believe that is \nnecessarily what female gamers want to address. I think the issue for \nfemale gamers is the following: where are our smutty games with mostly \nnaked males in the games, or badass chicks dual wielding through carnage \nwho are attractive, but not in a garish overly sexual costume as if they \nhave to be that way or a guy wouldn't play a game with a female protagonist \nunless she was fap material. One who has a cleverly designed costume and a \nneat story. I am an avid gamer, I know there have been strides in the \nindustry, that there are games that do feature a female lead character or \noption, and there are a lot of games (especially indie games) that do not \ninclude an overly sexual or sexist theme. As a female gamer I just don't \nwant to feel like second banana. Can't the guys and girls freaking out over \nthe feminist and anti-feminist understand my point of view as a consumer \nwith several female gamers as friends understand that point. No consumer or \nfan of a service wants to feel as though they are considered as a just in \ncase, maybe, or burden. The gaming industry is getting a little closer each \nyear, however, it is silly for any gamer to claim there is equal footing as \nfar as marketing and game options for the genders. Sexism is one of those \npolarizing words that is firing up a lot of passionate arguments, but I \nthink it is stealing the platform of the issues in video games as a female \nconsumer, as it turns from where are games for me towards insults, \ncensorship, and not shedding light on the actual advancements in the \nindustry and celebrating them. I don't care if you can murder a female \nprostitute, just let me kill a guy prostitute too. That is equality. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12dtnppvyjlurmoo04cfpb5dkfpyz2qflc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMxxPQZw1XhGLTWBjskS4A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-5WUjcDlLcJI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADjU/-wh-0DY4Ur4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Nick Irwin", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-19T22:01:53.147Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqMxxPQZw1XhGLTWBjskS4A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.98960621000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-19T22:01:53.147Z", "likeCount": 34, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111021146717167835245", "textDisplay": "I stopped watching when it said trigger warning.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z120yns4psyrjjgee225uxiaskihvfsd2": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdXHukDl_ilRIImaVHkva_g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OrqXzhBTENk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/3VBk6faCtAg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "NeverlandHunter", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-22T22:54:28.275Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdXHukDl_ilRIImaVHkva_g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.30908399999999997, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-09-22T22:54:28.275Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108280302671570997340", "textDisplay": "I'm a feminist and a gamer.

I'm not an expert on the guy, but my \nunderstanding is that Jack Thompson's agenda was to ban and censor all \nsorts of media that he objected to (and, not incidentally, sue the \npublishers for millions). Sarkeesian, meanwhile, is a feminist media \ncritic, and her 'agenda' seems to be to, well, produce feminist criticism \nof media. Anyway, regardless of whatever agenda a critic may or may not \nhave, the important thing is the strength of the criticism itself.\n\n\"I'm all for the criticizing of games, IF the games content lends itself to \nthe topic of discussion/ire(I.E.: Its reasonable to discuss the politics of \ngames that weave political commentary into the plot, but it would be \nasinine to discuss the political implications of Pacman as its plot is just \na paper thin and superficial excuse for the events/gameplay of the game to \noccur.)\"\n\nI completely disagree: finding broader cultural meaning and political \nsubtext in places where it might not be initially apparent is one of the \nthings that good criticism does. I think that actually, a lot of the best \ncriticism comes about when critics focus on media that wasn't meant to be \nespecially provocative or thoughtful - you learn a lot about a society by \nlooking at what it goes to for simple entertainment.\n\n\"She also cited Double Dragon for its use of the Damsel in Distress trope, \nwhen in the games ending, the Damsel incapacitates the main villain (in a \nsense to say, I am strong and I didn't need you to save me) essentially \nsubverting the trope.\"\n\nI'm not sure how fruitful it is to argue over one of Sarkeesian's examples, \nsince a big part of her approach is to show many examples of a given trope, \nbut I'd like to discuss this one... Again, I'm not an expert (I've only \nplayed a few of the Double Dragon games), but my understanding is: In her \nvideo, Sarkeesian shows footage from seven Double Dragon games released \nover the course of more than 20 years, and in all of them you see women \ngetting beaten and kidnapped; she doesn't show that in one of these games \n(the most recent?) there's also a moment where one of the kidnapped women \nkills (or at least stops) the bad guy. I really don't think that this one, \nsubversive moment somehow negates the other ways that the series has \nindulged in this particular trope, and it's also not even much of a \nsubversion within the one game, since the character still needs to be \nrescued by the male protagonist (right?).\n\n\"My final gripe with Anita is her absolute aversion to debate. Everyone \nwith a differing opinion (myself included) are label misogynists.\"\n\nHas she actually said this? My sense of it is that she's open to civil \ndebate and disagreement. I think that when she talks about the misogynists \nunfairly attacking her, she doesn't mean everyone who disagrees - she means \nthe misogynists who've been unfairly attacking her (of which there've been \nplenty).\n\n...wow this was long..."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjtZgHlxSUZMqndKnqS7amw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Magum Op", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ax5dxfzukchdiw04cdhyjzsj0yl5rt50", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-26T15:28:36.956Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjtZgHlxSUZMqndKnqS7amw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.22044400000000003, "formal_score": 22, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-26T15:28:36.956Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YEBrmkwWpVw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAF4k/TqPy28-fS7I/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115096675754860969419", "textDisplay": "To make a separate point, the job of a critic is to critique for the \nbetterment of the medium or its audience.

Using a charity event that may never happen to garner \nmoney, claiming you're sending money to a charity without prior \narrangements. That's actually illegal you see.\n\nAnd don't do that. If Zoe had dangly bits I wouldn't even bother TRYING to \nbe civil. 4chan wouldn't have bothered being civil. Dude would have more \npizzas than he knows what to do with arriving at his door every day for the \nrest of his life. And guess what? Nobody would give a single solitary FUCK \nthat he was now suffering. Because he's a man, he's expected to be able to \ndeal with it. Like I said with Tameem Antoinades back when DmC was being \nparaded about in front of our faces. People told him to shave off his \nstupid looking foppish faggoty hair and shove it up his own arse. People \nwere making whole videos to describe how much they hated the stupid cunt. \nHe got so much shit thrown at him that he actually had to abandon twitter \nand when he came back people had actually HATED HIM BALD. Where the fuck \nwere you? Where were you when this man was being slated by all the horrible \n\"white male gamers\" who had \"torn apart\" his game? You probably weren't \neven aware it was happening. Because it was a man and he should man up and \ndeal with it. But suddenly a fellow woman is in the firing line and it's \nall hands on fucking deck!\n\nThis is the great and magical double standard that all of you people adhere \nto. Men can defend themselves in the industry. Men can handle themselves. \nIf men are attacked it is not our job to defend them or help them because \nthey can deal with it. Women require at least 10,000 or so orbiting white \nknights at all times. Women who come under fire and scrutiny need us to \ndefend them and care for them. If women are attacked it is our job to make \nsure every detractor is called a horrible misogynistic white male and \nblocked/doxxed/ddos'd/ignored.\n\nAnd yes women who rock the boat get scrutinised MORE. So do men who rock \nthe boat. Because going against the flow will net you tons of people who \ndisagree vocally and violently. When a man rocks the boat, they usually get \ninsults, death threats, they can choose to stand their ground or they go \nquietly into the night. Usually they just ignore it and after a while \npeople simmer down. They'll still not be liked but they won't be getting \nharassment. But when women do something to upset lots of people (e.g. be \nbesties and get money from the people who are meant to be writing reports \non their games or call an entire group of people horrible because they like \nsomething you don't like and then misrepresent the thing to make it look \nterrible) then they also get shit. What they get, which men in the industry \nwill never get, is a legion of people screaming \"MUH SOGGY KNEE! YOU HATE \nTHIS PERSON NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING TERRIBLE OR HOLD AN OPINION YOU DON'T \nLIKE BUT BECAUSE SHE HAS A BEEF SARNIE IN HER TROUSERS! YOU HAVE NO \nLEGITIMATE POINTS AND I WON'T LISTEN EVEN IF YOU DOOOO!\". This then draws \nout the whole conflict. Because people who want to argue points get written \noff as horrible because they dare criticise a woman. It's even funnier when \nother women are called \"internally misogynistic\" because they also think \nwoman x is full of shit. This is why GamerGate is still happening. Because \npeople are fucking sick of being called sexists, homophobes, racists \nbecause they don't like something or someone. And yet the opposition \ncontinue to call us names and not do anything to defuse the situation.\n\nAnd for that last point; the studies that say women are becoming a more \ncore demographic of video games are unrepresentative. It has been shown \nagain and again that if you break down the genres and play time you see \nthat women mostly play casual phone/facebook games and men play the more \n\"hardcore\" AAA games and niche games like Ni No Kuni and Drakengard 3, a \ngame where you play as a strong female protagonist who kills all her \nsisters and collects their men like some kind of harem. I mean why do you \nthink there are very few female e-sports teams or female comp fighting game \nplayers? It's not because of some misogynistic group think, I'll tell you \nthat. It's because most women aren't attracted to the idea of living in a \nhouse with 4 or 5 other women playing the same game for 14 hours a day with \na piss bottle on standby. The industry isn't going to shoot themselves in \nthe foot by trying to pander to a demographic that barely exists to keep a \nvocal minority happy. Because games cost lots of money to make. Millions \nand millions of dollars. They have to get as many people on board as they \npossibly can and so they pander to \"white male gamers\", though I doubt the \n\"white\" is needed there. Because then their product won't sink their \nbusiness like the fucking Titanic. Even niche developers like Cavia have to \nwork really hard to make fans of the old Drakengard/Drag-on Dragoon games \ninterested in Drakengard 3, a game that has almost nothing to do with 1 or \n2. And all the new fans they got when they made NieR which is utterly \ndifferent to Drakengard. Because they need to make every penny they can.\n\nAnd just to finish up because I've already gone on way too long: Why don't \nmore women play Drakengard 3? It's a perfect game for feminists. You get to \nplay as a sexually liberated, strong in personality and body woman. She \nalso owns a fucking dragon! And by the end of the game she owns a whole \nselection of men. She's a great character so where is all the feminist \nsupport for Drakengard 3? Do they just ignore it because it's too \"video \ngamey\" to be considered good by their standards?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWSmYCaOTadBryLG3MK2LXw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "psyssi", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ax5dxfzukchdiw04cdhyjzsj0yl5rt50", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T16:34:23.523Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCWSmYCaOTadBryLG3MK2LXw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.21234400000000003, "formal_score": 5, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T16:34:23.523Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MGLmqnJIQjA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEw/P3MGpoDW8RQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105418439919281746191", "textDisplay": "+mxgabsy I have no issue with women in the games industry, and there are \nothers who share my feelings.

YOU'RE SOOOOO AMAZING!\". \nBecause their genitalia is not relevant to them owning a job or what praise \nthey deserve for having that job.\n\nLet's look at some of the women who have quite recently been openly \ncriticised by consumers in the industry shall we?\n\nDina from the Mighty No. 9 community forum: Found her way into the job \nbecause she's sleeping with one of the team. Acted unprofessionally and \nwhen people started turning on her she started mass banning the community \nshe was meant to represent and started turned the entire forum into a group \nof people who only circlejerk over her. Can't imagine why people would have \na problem with her.\n\nJennifer Hepler: A terrible writer who's only other work included a graphic \nnovel slammed by almost everyone about magical government agents who every \nnow and then stop to have gay and/or lesbian sex for usually very poorly \nexplained reasons. People didn't like her contributions to the plot of Mass \nEffect or Dragon Age, mostly consisting of poorly written and corny gay \nromance. This started the whole  EA using gay people as a criticism shield, \nwhich personally makes me despise them because my sexuality isn't their \nfucking get out of criticism free card.\n\nAnita Sarkeesian: Claims to love video games despite being quoted as saying \nshe doesn't actually play video games. Shit stirs for clicks and ad-revenue \nso she can spend the next 10 years living on easy street. Cherry picks and \nthen misrepresents portions of games to try and make them look far worse \nthan they actually are. Disables comments and ratings because she knows \nhundreds of people would refute her on almost every point she makes within \n10 minutes of uploading. Somehow oblivious to the fact that a group of \ndiverse individuals like gamers might not like to be called a bunch of fat, \nneckbearded, misogynists. Totally blown away when people who don't like \nbeing insulted constantly and also silenced on her comment feed so they \ncan't argue their point suddenly get aggressive and send her hurtful \nthings. I mean I know when I tie people up, gag them and then spend an hour \ntelling them how terrible of a person they are and then meet them in the \nstreet a day later they just want to give me the biggest fucking hugs.\n\nZoe Quinn: Made a shitty CYOA game using flash when she could of used any \nof hundreds of open source CYOA game makers. No art, subpar writing, game \nfocused completely on the only kind of depression she knows, white \nmiddleclass first world problems depression. Game barely explores what \ndepression would be like if you were poor in a country like America and \ncouldn't afford drugs or therapists. Also started GamerGate when every \nreporter/reporter who worked under the people she allegedly slept with \ntreated Depression Quest like it was the second coming. Which is incredibly \nbloody suspicious.\n\n\nThese women weren't targeted because their sexual organs don't dangle to \ntheir knees. They were targeted because they were shit at what they do. The \nsame reason anybody is given stick by the gaming community. People laughed \nat and ridiculed Tameem when DmC came about because the game was a fucking \ntrain wreck. Where was this total prat singing about how we should stop \nlaughing at Tameem so hard that he deletes his Twitter account? He doesn't \nget that because he's a man, and he's expected to take care of it himself. \nI find it so incredibly sexist that the \"fat misogynistic hateful\" gamer \ncrowd can ridicule, insult and criticise men in the industry all god damn \nday. But as soon as it's a woman there's 10,000 people all ready to say \"Oh \nmy god you can't say that, shitlord! She's got a VAGINA!\".\n\nAm I the only one who sees how fucked up that is?"}}]}, "z13vdjvhbvyitlskj22zgt0aalncslttl": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIiLySO21By06RLEWKx-gw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oInK3qNdxAw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASs/Z1X2l9cUmWM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "James Samsom", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-22T01:22:18.797Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UChIiLySO21By06RLEWKx-gw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.45783200000000002, "formal_score": 8, "updatedAt": "2014-09-22T01:29:14.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111924569295063526848", "textDisplay": "You conveniently skirted around Dr. Sommers' finding that the largest \ndemographic of people who devote the most time and resources to gaming is \nyoung men. \n\nThese games are designed for young men, and so reflect their interests. \nThis is an industry making a product for its consumers, not an industry \nthat is \"falling behind the times.\" So it seems somewhat ridiculous to \nstand on the sidelines and complain that the women depicted are too \nattractive or superficial, that the story lines appeal to male fantasies, \netc. \n\nThese games are made for boys, and that is because boys buy them. If girls \nwere as interested in games as boys, there would be more games designed for \ngirls. \n\nThat's Dr. Sommers' main point, and you avoided it. How odd...\n\nNow, are games marketed to boys sexist? I suppose that depends on how you \ndefine sexism. But do depictions of attractive women in media marketed to \nboys = sexism? Why? Because \"objectifying,\" I suppose? This is supposed to \nmean that the women are depicted as merely means and not ends, as Kant \nwould put it. Now I have two questions: does the depiction of an attractive \nwoman convey all of that information? And, if in some instances women are \ndepicted in this way, what's the problem? Why the outrage? Dr. Sommers \nmentioned that violence (including against women) has decreased \nsubstantially over the past few decades. So there doesn't seem to be any \ncorrelation between the \"objectification\" of women in video games and \nviolence against women. Where does the rubber meet the road here? What are \npeople really complaining about? \n\nNow, Dr. Sommers goes further and meets these young \"hard core gamers;\" she \ndoes some investigative journalism, you might say. What does she find? A \nsub-cult of angry misogynists? Nope. Just young guys looking to have a good \ntime.\n\nRemarkable.

If a person views \nanother or believes them to be in some negative light *because of their \ngender* (notice the emphasis on \"because of their gender\"), then it is \nsexism. This isn't *my* definition. It's based on reason. I'm not defining \nor redefining anything.\n\n*\"I believe either her or her co-writer mentioned on Twitter recently, that \nit's not really all that helpful to label individual people as sexists.\"*\n\nIf they did, then it would be a blatant hypocrisy, because she explicitly \nthrows the word \"sexist\" and \"misogyny\" at developers of games like Grand \nTheft Auto and Fat Princess.\n\n*\"It's just that people happen to take on cultural beliefs, and some of \nthose cultural beliefs happen to be sexist or have sexist implications.\"*\n\nAnd her position is that some video games contribute to that, which is \nbased on mere assumption, tenuous evidence, and/or misinterpreting studies. *That's \nthe big problem.*\n\n*\"I am saying that debating whether or not \"video games cause sexism\" is \npointless because it's such a nebulous idea to even define.\"*\n\nI agree, and that's what makes her Tropes vs. Women in Video Games series \ncompletely pointless. She wasted almost $160,000 in donations to make a \nshitty web series made of almost complete hypocrisy, bias, opinion, lies, \nand misinformation for educational purposes. Sure, once in a while she \nmight have a good point (e.g. the creation of Ms. Pac Man being akin to \nAdam and Eve), but it's rare. This is absolutely unacceptable to present on \n*any* academic level.\n\n*\"If one person interprets it as \"video games brainwash you into hating \nwomen\", and the other believes \"video games are pieces of media which, like \nall media, contribute to society wide culturally fuelled beliefs about \ngender roles and sexual politics\", then the two people are going to just be \ntalking past each other and won't be able to have a meaningful \nconversation... Even if they technically are both talking about the same \nidea of \"video games causing sexism\".*\n\nThe former position is a straw man of the latter. The latter position is \nexactly what I'm seeing. The disagreement I have is that's not as \"toxic\" \nas she puts it, and if it somehow *is*, then the piece of media doesn't \nhave to change.

First off, despite your \nclaims that she has no source, you fail to provide even a single source in \nyour rebuttal, which is kind of hypocritical. Second off, you can't just \nwin an argument by \"singing\".\nSecond point: You claim that she's cherrypicking, yet every single comment \nyou showed in your video was handpicked out of the masses of well-thought \nout claims against radical feminism in video games. Feminism is very \ncorrupting to the industry, and will destroy video-games as we know it if \nwe don't stop it.\nLast point: females do not make up the majority of video-games, so stop \nspouting that shit. Last off, if you want video-games to be less sexist, \nthen make your own fucking video-games, stop attacking others favorite \nvideo-games by forcing the producers to rape their story to hell in order \nto appeal to you faggots.\nIn conclusion: Fuck off, because you are ruining the industry. We've been \nhere since the 1980's, and then you faggots show up sometime in the last \nfive years, notice how \"evil\" we are, because we don't conform to your \nradical views and Nazi-like approach.\nWhat right do you have to destroy everything we love, and then claim that \nyou guys are the morally right in this?\n\nHere's a similar situation that can be compared to what you're doing: There \nare a bunch of people that have been reading this book series for many \nyears, and they love it. Suddenly, some people read it, and hate the way \nthe book talks about orcs in it, (where orcs are considered the bad guys in \nit). So instead of realizing that there are people with a differing opinion \nthat theirs, they proceed to protest everything the novel series stood for, \neffectively destroying the novel series, and killing the entire fanbase. \nThe people who just witnessed their favorite novel series getting burned to \nthe ground then start to complain about the people who destroyed their \nfavorite novel series, but the destroyers fail to realize why they are \nangry, and not thanking them. They come to the conclusion that the fans are \nmentally diseased, and need to be publicly shamed for their existence. This \nangers the fans, who then try to remove the destroyers from their fan-base \nso they can save what little remains of their beloved novel series. Once \nthis occurs, the destroyers become enraged, and proceed to dox, harass, and \nverbally attack everyone who stands against them, claiming that they will \nnot give up or stand down. The destroyers win yet again, and the fans are \nforced to give up yet another thing that they once loved. The destroyers, \nthough, aren't satisfied with the carnage that they have caused, and move \non to yet another novel series, and proceed to destroy that as well. Also, \nthe majority of the destroyers never even read the novels, they just \ndecided that it was evil, and needed to be \"fixed\".\nReplace all this with video-games, read it over a couple hundred times, and \nyou'll get an idea of what feminism has contributed to video-games. You \npeople don't care about video-games, you only care about pushing your own \nagenda.\n\n\nP.S.: What good came from singing the entire thing? While this has nothing \nto do with my argument, the singing was completely unneeded, unnecessary, \nand only served to hurt your argument, rather than help it.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z121hx3qxyagh1nxt04ci5expq2thf0istc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrVdmo7XW9higUaqg9pEIdQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TXdeFEknpws/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE0/3jhatLhDBqY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Vivian James", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-19T23:19:34.380Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrVdmo7XW9higUaqg9pEIdQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.297236, "formal_score": 24, "updatedAt": "2014-09-19T23:19:34.380Z", "likeCount": 6, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110803568203627882207", "textDisplay": "Can't wait for ratings and comments to be closed.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13eyfuxymjhhta5f04chb0rxsibc1min1w": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3GRC4KMqyrMPTnsWJdpZg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5Q2IYHN1YDA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADE/H_-xw36twCI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Michael O'Hare", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-18T21:33:25.286Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCI3GRC4KMqyrMPTnsWJdpZg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.60167799999999994, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-12-18T21:33:25.286Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112358297198051398379", "textDisplay": "Thumbs down for me, but at least I'm allowed th give a thumbs down on this \nvideo so thanks for that, Mann.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z124cvyxop2zi3f1z22vf1npllv3uf4cj": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy2v8VGpUlB4-10gXILBzQw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QxELa4CGX0A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACE/3Mi2p_8PBFc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Rifqy Nafis", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-10T17:40:43.948Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCy2v8VGpUlB4-10gXILBzQw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.56537199999999999, "formal_score": 13, "updatedAt": "2014-10-10T17:40:43.948Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110019436776072373888", "textDisplay": "if we make video like this against Anita, i wonder if we got flagged for \nharrassment\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12bdzlpzwflypwgh04ccz3huwz1dfubucg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg9QFR_2xX17N9exxN2U9Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t8mbEj1-aNM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAARGE/6d_1nCxGt4U/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Not Billy Mays", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-29T01:39:26.977Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrg9QFR_2xX17N9exxN2U9Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.038143999999999956, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-09-29T01:39:26.977Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117646736787313328983", "textDisplay": "Also, your claims about the lack of females in video games is because the \nmain video game demographic is male.

I mean how else could you \ncompletely fail to understand the words you insist on using. For instance I \nsee you use title as if you are under the impression that when one uses a \ntitle the only content in a video or other titled work must be directly \nrelated to the title. Allow me to assure you this is not the case a title \ncan be merely a general cover all to the content. I believe you have \nmistaken topic for title. I think you have also misunderstood the term \nbackup in relation to claims. You see when one makes claims they can indeed \nsite studies, sometimes the relationship can be difficult to understand. \nYou see when pointing out the number of women that play games she is \n\"inferring\" that the games are unlikely to cause sexism unless you believe \nthat most if not all of these women are being programmed to hate \nthemselves. I believe a link to the definition of infer is relevant.\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/infer\nYou use the word \"conflate\" as though to imply that it is a negative thing. \nYou see often people will combine ideas as a way to show that they are \nrelated. Take for instance Misogyny (a hatred or fear of women) and \nviolence (a physical act resulting in harm) you see when one hates and \nfears something they often tend to react to that thing with violence. I \nknow your thinking this is a ling comment but I want to be helpful as you \nlearn our language as I would hope someone might be if I were learning \nanother language. It's really no problem. Ah I see you misunderstand how \none can talk about violence in relation to sexism. The issue here is that \nyet again she is using inference. When one claims that video games can \ncause specific negative behaviors they would not assume that if one \nbehavior type is caused that no other behavior type is caused. In this case \nfor those of us with a background in psychology specifically behavioral \nconditioning It would be unlikely enough that an activity that could cause \nsexism could not cause also violence or any other less complicated types of \nbehavior. In fact it would be virtually impossible given all we know about \nthe human brain and behavioral conditioning. Ah I see someone has taught \nyou to use Ad Hominem you see for one to commit the falacy of ad hominem \nthey must indeed be making an irrelevant point about the character of \nanother person. See Anita Sarkeesian has a bachelors degree in \nCommunications and a masters in Media Studies according to her Wikipedia \nneither of these in any way qualify her to be doing research or studies \nbased off of these topics. She is quite literally as unqualified as it gets \nit would be like asking an astrophysicist to design the circuit for a \ncomputers motherboard. Ah you seem to have missed that the lady you are \nsinging about has in fact stated a list of points. In the English language \nis is quite often common to list the items you are referring to before \nbefore making a point as to how they are related. Such as Hoffman listing \nissues that indeed may be sexist and definitely merit further research. Ah \nI see you must have thought she meant actually picking fruit when she \nreferred to \"cherry picking\". This phrase is actually a colloquialism that \nrefers to the mistake uneducated people tend to make when attempting to \nutilize the scientific method. It is unfortunately common for people just \nlearning how science works to try and find pieces of evidence to prove \ntheir personal theory. However true science takes account of all the facts \nin order to find out what is actually occurring. Think of a match one could \n\"cherry pick\" that putting sulfur on the end of a stick of material would \ncause it to burn when struck and continue to burn until the material was \nmostly consumed. However in real science one would do experiments or make \nas many observations as they can and discover that indeed it only works \nthat way with specific materials. I hope that helps. Feel free to message \nme if you want more in depth explanation of the term \"cherry picking\". Ah \nyou see when Miss Sommers states that males will prefer games with strong \nmale protagonists and sexy female characters is because they are males and \nyou got that confused with the typical dismissive \"boys will be boys\" I can \nsee your issue. You see in this country evolution is most often taught in \nschools being as how it is the most generally accepted theory to date. She \nis in fact referring to more animal drives that are still in existence in \nboth genders and continue to affect both genders to this day. I see you \nmust have been taking a philosophy class in order to learn our wonderful \nlanguage. You must not have fully understood False Equivalence. You see \nwhen she compared the criticisms leveled against one media with the \nimaginary criticisms against another form of media she was not intending to \ninfer that those two are the same things. She was very clearly trying to \npoint out how a reversal of genders might make the original seem silly. She \nwas in fact not comparing Oprah to Video Games she was comparing the \nemotional impact of criticisms made without any real evidence or fact based \nresearch. This can be a difficult concept to wrap your head around but I \nassure you it is common practice in psychological studies to utilize this \ntype of mixing up of factors to try and eliminate as many biases on the \npart of the researchers and the subjects themselves. Ah I see you \nmisunderstood her claims of having data as if she had stated that she would \nimmediately release it or was in fact using it to validate a specific \ntheory. Their are two factors in our culture that might confuse you one is \nthat she might not release specifics right there in such a short video, as \nthe numbers are quite often boring, however if you were to contact her she \nmight readily send you the info. You see most educators recognize that one \nmust cater to ones audience in order to insure the best transfer of \ninformation possible. While she might expound upon the data she reviewed in \na classroom setting or when speaking in front of colleagues in a \nprofessional capacity as that would be the appropriate arena for that. I \nsee that by the end of your video you have at least understood the most \nimportant part of American culture. The fact that insisting on looking and \nspeaking like a fool is entirely your right and I for one applaud your \nbravery. I merely felt that this might not have been your intention so I \nfigure to leave this friendly comment.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zgjfxvqmninivb22nv5uq4pykthdit04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKjKcx8xdxOYnaFV_RkQ34g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ky1Zbt9qzEc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/B_SIBhjrnjs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.38610038610038611, "authorDisplayName": "AndrewNewZealand", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-12T10:11:06.648Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKjKcx8xdxOYnaFV_RkQ34g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.55313400000000001, "formal_score": 6, "updatedAt": "2015-09-12T22:10:58.000Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103940997584493193260", "textDisplay": "What is her interest in video games anyway?

Not so much \"boy will be boys\" as \"boys MUST be boys\" or \nelse something is wrong.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zjriygx32vxtzl04cgrm5jlfzcpxj40s": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtcpbynXTo0R1z5siGLqWCg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-T4yExKuP6yY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACY/Vfmf5fWbLSk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.69930069930069927, "authorDisplayName": "Dominic Stpehenson", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-22T09:34:28.606Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCtcpbynXTo0R1z5siGLqWCg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.84238640000000009, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-10-22T09:34:28.606Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115653716110846215209", "textDisplay": "This is just plain stupid.

Sommer's makes a quick \njib at the \"hipster cultural studies\" and it's true that there are many \npeople not experience enough with either feminist or other academic studies \nthat mean they should know the limits of the points they are making. But \nSommer should see teh weakness in her critique as well cause she is the \nexact same for entering video games and thinking she has the experience to \ncorrectly address the issues, I have a irritation with anita as they both \nfeel like adding similar errors to a very passionate communitiy. \n\nThe problem is people don't think the same. No matter how we want to \nbelieve that we share common beliefs or backgrounds every person is \ndifferent. We always share things with people but we are no thinking the \nsame. In example the major gaming industry, soto speak, says the games taht \nwill sell the best is the one that attracts the biggest audience but if \nthey make that game what happens if they do not even bother to take into \nconsideration that what their making is not something other people want. \nI'm all for, let's randomly pull out of my hat, a game like Gears of War. I \nlove the series it actually has a lot to teach about when it comes to men \nbeing real people who aren't just beefy manly man who don't think or feel \njust shot but because of teh art style people are very quickly judgemental \nabout it and poke at it like every other boy game with no depth. This type \nof weakness in viewpoint damages or empowers different people. And to not \ntake those into account and say diversity isn't an issue means you don't \nwant to think like other people and than in turn say their way of thinking \nis wrong."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoCfMd6DeIxy2eD603E8uSA", "inappropriate_score": 1.0101010101010102, "authorDisplayName": "Calvin Fan", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cxz0ghzetedc3x232w1iypp2ngz21c", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T07:20:54.636Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoCfMd6DeIxy2eD603E8uSA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.21336200000000005, "formal_score": 57, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T07:20:54.636Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OCbF9lReick/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGI/_F2wyW-BQ5E/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111304889078026194711", "textDisplay": "+TempRawr Too bad I don't really care much about what is considered \n\"progressive.\" A good amount of the time it only pisses people off if the \n\"progressive\" people act like they're oh so special and unique for it. \nAlso, is it really diversity if everyone thinks the same?"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB0aJc4xbHjMnLqtZESGx2w", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TempRawr", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13cxz0ghzetedc3x232w1iypp2ngz21c", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T07:17:00.765Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCB0aJc4xbHjMnLqtZESGx2w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.76046600000000009, "formal_score": 21, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T07:17:00.765Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113763367391432150791", "textDisplay": "that's too winded of a conversation plus it sounds like you trying to make \na egotistical talk bait, so that's a lose-lose sitaution. \n\nAll i will say video games aren't getting worse...

She tries to \nmake everyone believe she comes from an insider's perspective.\n\nSexualization has never been the same as objectification and demonizing \nsexualization is demonizing sexuality itself. She's basically saying that \nmen should feel ashamed for finding women and their body attractive while \nwearing more makeup than my mom has ever wore in her entire lifetime. She \nconstantly categorizes all gamers as the same type of evil people and \ndemonize them without any shame. She constantly encourages her followers to \nshame gamers as a whole and she encourage people to fail to distinguish \nthem. If you play videogames, you are sexist and if you try to distance \nyourself from the label, you are an apologist who is trying to blame the \nvictim.\n\nWake the *fuck* up.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ywtwyqputgfdu222wyjhrjmadit33c": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTmZSCFQFnwHFL7ifsrynpw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zY9THC7mUek/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEk/FtAvE_EYN4Q/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 9.0909090909090917, "authorDisplayName": "Purposly", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-19T22:06:31.534Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTmZSCFQFnwHFL7ifsrynpw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.98219838999999998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-19T22:06:31.534Z", "likeCount": 10, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110485419716134352148", "textDisplay": "are you really this fucking stupid?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z132w1r4nsrehx0tc22yydvqjkvnipjhp04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpjtRNjeS68pQO9mW4aeMg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Fresh New Thing", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-25T10:42:22.130Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGpjtRNjeS68pQO9mW4aeMg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.98960151000000007, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-09-25T10:42:22.130Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102241609684962769725", "textDisplay": "I'm pretty sure I could fart out better music than this\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z122wzkhptz3udigh04cdfjohoynxdvxvmg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWAZRN4bIq4b_uIkhIMl6TA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EdPAV5o8i8Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEM/0bv8p2iQ1s8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 4.0, "authorDisplayName": "Marco Creen", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-08T15:01:58.951Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCWAZRN4bIq4b_uIkhIMl6TA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.96141760000000009, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2015-08-08T15:01:58.951Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109234258447985543999", "textDisplay": "Oh my god what a fag -

I believe that she is speaking \nas an outside party looking at the gaming industry and that who she is \ntalking to, other parties outside of the core gaming audience looking in. \nThe gaming industry has faced outside criticism from outside parties before \nsuch as Glenn Beck saying Watch Dogs teaches you to hack. Beck is not a \ngamer. He is not interested in games, nor the industry yet here he is \ngiving a criticizing it. I think Sommers is speaking to those like Beck who \nbefore showed no interest in gaming but only now have become involved and \nagain not for the sake of gaming, but for a political or social movement. I \nbelieve these are the people she is saying to stand down. To be honest I \nagree with her. The gaming community as a whole is not sexist. I would say \nthe same is true overall at the games that come out. Are there those in \nboth the community and the games that are sexist, of course there is, \nhowever, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. The Legend of Zelda is not some \nsexist gaming trying to keep women in the kitchen, It's a game about a boy \nwho goes on an adventure. Looking at games before all of this controversy \none could see how more and more games were beginning to move away from \nthese traditionally held ideas. Games like Portal are examples of males \nbeing okay with playing as a female. Games like Other M demonstrate males \ncriticizing the game for making Samus a weak character , and one that was \nnot in keeping with her true character. These are just two examples of many \nof how the gaming community was naturally moving away from thins that were \nactually sexist. Once more is that gamers are not blind to the sexism in \ngaming, when a woman comes out in a revealing outfit there is a lot of eye \nrolling. For years people having been giving nintendo crap about Mario \nsaving Peach, In my humble opinion this whole criticism against gaming \nbeing sexist, is at best a waste of time that has caused more harm than \ngod, and at worst a slight tactic to push certain political agendas in what \nhad been an untapped pool of influence. That's just my two cents, and \nthat's probably as much as its worth. haha"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxaaT7hyRSU1xJSZsOtvF6Q", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "KaBar41", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12zv3opgxbgtdyb504chdug1waztpvxfds", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-22T03:31:24.910Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCxaaT7hyRSU1xJSZsOtvF6Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99888995300000005, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-22T03:31:24.910Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-X0o0f6iY144/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/RZk6r4fdmV0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110204195096265578847", "textDisplay": "+Ben English\n\nI'm not a misogynistic shithead and I hate Sarkeesian.

And has \nhad a personal relationship with her. Any polygon is ok with it. All of VOX \nare promoting Quinn and Sarkeesian instead of things like TFYC. \n\nIn the music rebuttal, he says \"What does violence have to do with \nvideogames\" Well she was showing how video games dont have an affect on our \npersonality. ie. If we are violent in videogames, we will not be violent in \nreal life. She postulates that the same is true for misogyny. \n\nWhen she referred to the number of gamers, she was referring to Sarkeesian \nsaid that men are most of the players, she was showing that wasnt true. \n\nWhen he talks about cherry picking, her using examples is not the same as \nthe VAST amount of cherry picking and false data Sarkeesian used (again \nthis is a direct rebuttal to those videos Anita did so I will use them in \ncontrast)\n\nSarkeesian directly says that the games are making you sexist, misogynistic \nand violent. You can go through her twitter history and see that on there. \n\nSarkeesian has never, and I repeat, NEVER cited a single real data source \nfrom a credited study in her videos. Ever. So if they are saying this 5 \nminute video doesnt cite enough sources compared to her 30 minute ones, \nwell thats wrong, because in the description there are all the sources and \na followup fact checking article (can be found on medium)\n\nThose \"sexist\" tweets like \"Die bitch\" are the exact tweets I get whenever \nI make a joke. Once again, go look at my @ reply history. Ive been called \nbitch, slut, cantankerous whore (by admittedly a more creative troll) these \ninsults are not because she is a woman. It's because she presented false \ninformation about things like Hitman, and ended up muddying an actual \nimportant issue about women being misrepresented in ALL media. (I include \nmovies, tv, etc)\n\nHere is the biggest problem. Women are misrepresented. Im literally so \nfucking bored with playing the generic white guy in Call of Duty style \ngames. Give me a Buffy, give me a Cat Zingano, fuck give me Marie Curie and \nhave her shoot laser beams from her eyes, just give me SOMETHING. But Anita \nSarkeesian, these professional victims who lie in their videos to get \npatreon support, these people arent the answer. But there is an answer. \nTFYC. Do you know why you havent heard of TFYC on polygon? Because Zoe \nQuinn, who has a relationship with Ben from Polygon, and who he pays money \nto monthly, made a GameJam, that she profits from, and she doxxed and \ntanked TFYC which is for charity, her competition. \n\nSo what are TFYC? They are a group of female programmers from Columbia that \nwant to promote women in gaming. They started a gamejam that allowed women \n(and transgendered) to enter a competition by submitting game ideas. They \nwould help them build the game, and give 8% profit to the winner, the \nremainder going to charity. Zoe got them shut down and Polygon refuses to \ncover them. Remember that. \n\nIf want more women in gaming, if you want there to be more diversity in \nstory, if you want there to be female protagonists, the solution isnt \nAnita, whos videos are a half hour, cite no facts, misrepresent games and \ncost 30,000$ to produce. Its not Zoe Quinn who made DepressionQuest (go \nplay it, tell me thats a good game) and tanks a charity to promote a \ngamejam whos money goes directly into her paypal account. And it isnt \nPolygon who supports Anita and Zoe financially and cover stories about \nthem. Its the TFYC, bringing women actually in to gaming.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ud525zoegxzdnp23szvexwvuke12qp04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Ac75mq8ZppcARQfczph3w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BK3udsfpLSU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/eQX6eSucaTE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mike Millage", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-22T12:23:18.878Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6Ac75mq8ZppcARQfczph3w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.88261199999999995, "formal_score": 16, "updatedAt": "2014-09-22T12:23:18.878Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117375139145118386093", "textDisplay": "SEE!

They only get the budget for studio time, and most of their money \nfrom gigs, radio play (if they even get any, which doesn't even happen) \ngoes straight to their third-party label. That's why bands like Tool got a \nhuge break. They started a sulf-funded record label, which didn't really \npromote or do anything like that. With only four albums, almost no radio \nplay, and a ton of gigs over the years, one band member's net worth is over \n40 million. It's a huge risk, but it can pay off in the end. \n\nI think that that U2 thing was a bunch of bullocks. U2 are basically the \nmost wealthy touring band in the world. The fact that they can self-promote \nby doing what they did shows yet again that big bands are drowning out \nlittle bands that are still on third party labels.\n\n\n\"The band/artist isn't liked in big enough numbers\" That usually isn't the \ncase. Look at Wintersun for example. Their fanbase has been going strong \nfor years and have even stuck it out almost a decade for a new album. They \ngot their wish and they have been touring in NA and in the EU for almost a \nwhole year in 2012.  They are signed to Nuclear Blast and their \nvocalist/rhythm guitarist self-produces the album in his own home. Seems \nfair enough right? Well, their record label only provides a budget for a \nthird-party studio, under their current band name and the label provides a \ntime limit for the certain album to be done due to...wait for it...the \npopularity of the band's previous album. So they are popular enough, but he \ncan't receive the funding to produce/master/mix the record in his own home, \nso Wintersun's new album has been stalled for months on end. Fans even \nstarted a fund to help the band (which was prohibited by Nuclear Blast) but \nthe money went straight to the vocalist/rhythm guitarist. Almost a failure, \nbut a great amount of fans\n\nMusic piracy is inevitable. It is so poorly enforced and law enforcement \nrather catch a teen with a bag of weed than a guy downloading a whole \ndiscography. Nonetheless, record sales aren't determined by how many \nphysical copies have been sold, but how many outlets they have been \ndistributed to. If an album is in high demand, it will be sold almost \neverywhere, and it will top charts. Digital purchases (iTunes, Spotify) do \nreflect the album's sales in direct purchases though. \n\nRadio stations and TV stations are irrelevant. They only cater to so-called \n\"music lovers\" who have short attention spans and can't find artists/bands \noutside of the mainstream niche. That also goes for bands like you listed; \nJimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and even bands like Metallica, Guns N' Roses, \nNirvana etc. That's why when people think of big bands they think of those \nbands because of their mainstream productivity and success, which is \nvirtually un-matchable. Even though there are bands releasing content that \nis even better than those bands, they are on non-mainstream labels, and are \nbeing promoted in non-mainstream places.

If you find video games to \nbe sexist, how would you make them not sexist? From the arguments I've \nheard, if a female is portrayed as being sexy in a video game, that's \nsexist. If a female is there for sexual appeal, that's sexist. If a female \nis in dire need of help, that's sexist. If a female can be hurt in a video \ngame, that's sexist. So, what do you propose? Should women in video games \nbe forced to a strict dress code? Should sexual attractive (female) \nfictional characters be outlawed? Should we make all female video game \ncharacters invulnerable to all damage with god like powers? Honestly, what \nwould your proposed solution be? How would you take a game that you find \nsexist, and alter it?\n\nLook, these games appeal to a specific demographic. In an industry that is \nprimarily male, more games will be tailored to men. It's great when a game \ncomes along that breaks the mold, that furthers the industry, and expands \nthe market, but you have to acknowledge that an industry will do it's best \nto appeal to the majority of its consumers. If 90% of consumers are of X \ndemographic, while 10% are of Y demographic, you can expect around 90% of \ngames tailored to X demographic. It would be ignorant and simply dishonest \nto state that the industry is immoral, biased, or prejudice, because the \nmajority of the products don't appeal to my 10% demographic. You'd have to \nbe incredibly selfish and self centered to demand that video games change \nto appeal to you, what you desire, and what you find, \"appropriate.\" The \nfact of the matter is that video games do not make people violent. They do \nnot make people sexist. They do not make people racist, bigoted, or the \nlike, because they are fictional forms of entertainment. The vast majority \nof people can differentiate fact from fiction, reality from fantasy, and so \non. There's an incredibly wide variety of video games out there. If you \ndon't like certain ones, don't play them, don't financially support them, \nheck, even share your opinions on them, but the second someone starts using \ntheir subjective opinion to claim that certain games are objectively \nsexist, then I got a problem.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12hhvcbgqr2jh0jg04cgztrtsrowvwazac": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 25, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VozGcye2L6PBpck_HiHfw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Tgkj6Dd2lNs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAs/IGJg33eaM2o/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.49751243781094528, "authorDisplayName": "Haxa", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T03:18:44.392Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9VozGcye2L6PBpck_HiHfw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.68608000000000002, "formal_score": 14, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T03:18:44.392Z", "likeCount": 135, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103915748798813832828", "textDisplay": "Those tweets near the end show nothing about gamers or gamer culture.

The radical feminists are fascists because they want the world to \nadopt their views and narrative, which is about victims and completely \nignorant of everything else, and they will not stop until everyone accepts \nit - like with organized religions or conspiracy theories. They are like \nconspiracy theorists, but with balls. Not much more mentally stable than \nconspiracy theorists - but they are effective if you think fascism is \neffective at doing something.\n\nIt's not sexism which is the problem. They may believe that narrative, but \na narrative is not a final goal. Look at the irrational religions and how \nthey hide behind statements like \"Islam is a religion of peace\". They never \nwant their bullshit to be tackled directly. It's a strategy for power \ngrabbing. I'm not saying the front-line \"troops\" are aware of it- no, or \nthey'd object to being used if they grasped it. But if you can read between \nthe lines, the actual content behind the mind of ANY crowd is simply: \"any \nindividuals who are not compatible with our feelings, deserve to be \nremoved\". *Angry mobs have existed for thousands of years*. How is this any \ndifferent? It would be different if it was a crowd made up of individuals \nwho all had actual original opinions. But you can see clear as day, that \npeople rally around simplified ideas which weigh next to nothing in \nintelligence. The fact that no-one can explain themselves in rational terms \nshows this. There is no GamerGate philosophy. It's simply a rejection on \nemotional terms, and as such it won't beat the insane radical feminists.\n\nFeminism itself has not been a major problem in the past 100 years. Women \nhave always been closer to dogs in global society than men, this is plain \nto see. No-one is arguing that, if they have any mind at all. What kind of \nworld is it, where women wear masks in the Middle East all the time? In \nsome countries there, the women are only allowed out of the house to drive \nor go shopping. That's why feminism will remain important: to place women \non an equal level as far as rights. But the cultural aspect will take much \nlonger to \"equalize\", and Anita Sarkeesian probably isn't able to process \nthat, but no less, her character makes her a deceitful, manipulative, \ncompulsive liar. Nobody with half a brain would get behind her \nunquestioningly. She, like Zoe Quinn, has become an idol - no, a martyr. \nIt's perfectly valid to draw comparisons to organized religion, since it's \nsimply another term for ideology, in politics. Like the term religion \nitself, ideologies rely on hiding behind certain \"good\" labels to distract \nfrom their insanity. With Anarchism and Zeitgeist, it's the goal of utopia. \nWith ISIS, it's some brand of 72 virgins and feeling guilty for science \nthat reveals flaws with the Quran, which they really believe was written by \nan illiterate in a fucking cave hearing the voice of god. With radical \nfeminism, it's the victim card which is itself strikingly sexist in an \nattack of women as independent individuals with their own strength and \nthought process - and the real meat of what they are saying, is that men \nshould somehow pay, in order to tip the balance in the other direction. \nIt's a destructive ideology that cunningly preaches hate with a smiley \nface. You have to be pretty stupid to fall from it, unless you were born \naround idiots - just like the irrational religions.\n\nThe point here is that nobody actually understands what's going on. How can \nyou have a conversation over air horns? That's what it's like with the \nconstant stream of emotionalized messages. If TV didn't educate society, \nwhy would the ramblings that come out of it help any?\n\nIt's not the new generation of Internet users which is at fault. It's not \ncorruption, or some evil nature of all politics, or even the sheep games \njournalists who fall for it because their very job is about not filtering \ninformation with a conscious focus. The core problem is worldview, which \ngoes all the way down to science vs. religion and further than that. People \nwhose minds filter information in a certain way will always be impressioned \nin that same way, regardless of what patterns you point out to them. Only a \nfew of us have the aptitude and capacity for the truth. Crowds don't deal \nin fact or even opinion, they are simply personal armies for people who \nwant to manipulate the world to gain power. Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian \nare small-time players, actually.. look at Hollywood. Look at the military \nand the government. Very few people even see the manipulation, even when \nthey're pitted against each other to fight like dogs.\n\nThe only way out, of everything not just the most recent emotional clash, \nis high quality thinking. Think about it. For days not minutes."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsEFOonbUBlmlHvoS70JvUg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TonyKnockOff", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12hhvcbgqr2jh0jg04cgztrtsrowvwazac", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-22T04:33:07.964Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCsEFOonbUBlmlHvoS70JvUg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.33356800000000003, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-22T04:33:07.964Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-avUkBdtRvL0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/5H2VuuCw7hs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109395572558207199398", "textDisplay": "It's the latest feminism technique that's adopted from Anita, \ncherry-picking."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGQbSS5uIYUvc8fZIHRNstw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "THunter", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12hhvcbgqr2jh0jg04cgztrtsrowvwazac", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-21T06:48:11.634Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCGQbSS5uIYUvc8fZIHRNstw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.60491199999999989, "formal_score": 56, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-21T06:49:59.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118064935340855688902", "textDisplay": "It is a shame really because issues like these always drag out a \ngeneralized blanket of accusations, leaving out so much gray and the \nmajority of open-minded free thinkers who are lumped in with extremists \nfrom both ends, the media gives face to these issues with opinions  that \nare more sensational on both sides causing an illusion of truth that is \nmagnified.\n\nSo in the case of sexism in video games, the arguments have appeared to \nlump every guy gamer who doesn't exactly agree in one category of sex \nobsessed, unsympathetic to the diversity of games for females, and enjoying \nharassing chuckles under anonymity (which trash talking is frequent of both \ngenders and a part of gaming culture and the interwebs judging from any \nmultiplayer online or forum) while pegging female gamers as feminist and \ncalling for less sex themes in games as though we are upset by sex.\n\nBoth parties exist, but they are a small majority so it alienates a large \nportion of male gamers who are not sexist or the females whose guy friends \nand gamer buddies have been so supportive.

Look up \nporn games, you'll find a lot of flash games where the player is invited to \nmolest tied up women to orgasm (although if GTA didn't cause a spike in \ngeneral violent crimes, I seriously doubt those will cause a spike in rapes \nor sexual assaults, and no this is not a false equivolence, we're talking \nabout games influencing real world behaviour, and that mechanism has been \nfalsified over and over so many times, we're not even pointing rubble any \nmore, we're down to gravel of mainly 6mm or smaller, keep this up, it'll be \na fine grain of dust).\n\nI have a Hypothesis at this point: The media is everywhere, people are \neverywhere, and certain people think the way you influence people is to \nmake tighter rules on the media, ignoring the fact that the media, in order \nto make a profit, HAS TO BE DIVERSE IN ORDER TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO LIVE.\n\n\"The media\" is not one organisation, there are lots of media corporations \ncompeting in the market space, so name a niche, and there's a producer \nseeking to fill it. So, some shows are sexist if there's a niche for that, \nsome shows are racist if there's a niche for that, but by and large, \nespecially if there's a big budget that MUST make a decent return, it can't \nafford to be racist, sexist or homophobic.\n\nIf you actually sit through some of Anita's videos, considering her \noverarching claim is that female tropes are deployed as an effort to \noppress women, it's possible some legislators might attempt to cater for \nthat (and if we're talking politicians, we're talking about people whose \nexperience of gaming don't go beyond the games that come free with their \noperating system if even that), if Anita's word becomes law, and you do \nneed to actually listen to all her words to get my point here, consider: \nCan you comply? Can you make a videogame that is Anita Complient?\n\nI would say there is no such thing as Anita Complient. And if there is, \nit'll be the narrowest, absolute least diverse thing you can imagine. ... \n... Whoops ... ...\n\nTell you what though: The movie Equilibrium, a game based on that ought to \nbe Anita Complient if ever there is such a thing.\n\nA predominantly male consumer base does not make the market itself \ninherently sexist. There will probably be more female consumers in the \nmarketspace as time goes on, and game producers already do and will \ncontinue to want to sell games to them.\n\nOh, I'm sure some gamers are issuing threats of violence. It's a big \nconsumer base, composed mainly of humans, and some humans, are inevitably, \nbell ends. I don't assume all christians are dipshits just because Pat \nRobertson's a cunt, I don't assume all muslims are mass mudering \npsychopaths just because Islamic State is full of such individuals, I don't \nassume all feminists are lying shits just because Anita is, why should all \nor even most gamers be considered sexist just because some dipshits who \nhappen to also play video games are?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13wxvy42rbyghp3422svrcguky3sjt1h": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCblQ5DaGV5sCMFv1hXVT3sw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ltzwr59vgXw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/s0gbFBbkAPc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Twinerism", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-21T03:40:13.069Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCblQ5DaGV5sCMFv1hXVT3sw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.053112000000000048, "formal_score": 17, "updatedAt": "2014-09-21T03:40:13.069Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109392496353074424390", "textDisplay": " Christina Hoff Sommer, the 'feminist' known for taking the subject of \nfeminism and demanding that men be the center discussion, as she elaborated \n\"The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men.\" \namong many other articles and interviews by her, supported and found on \npopular Anti-feminist sites like AVFM. \n\nYeah.

Is there sexism in games and are women taking over \ngames?  Well the studies she and Mann mention address the second point very \nclearly.  So for Mann to complain that she needs to cite different studies \nis a bit...odd.  Maybe he got confused in the catchy beat?\n\nOne of the key failing points is the context used in the song.  When the \nsubject of misogyny and violence is brought up, Mann tries to separate them \ndespite being intertwined.  This is in part due to the misuse of the word \nmisogyny and the way it has been used heavily in the narrative lately.  It \nhas since been a catchall phrase to defame someone rather than its original \ndarker meaning.  But misogyny, real misogyny, is almost always associated \nwith sexism and violence which are key components.  Whereas sexism doesn't \nneed misogyny nor violence and is somewhat subjective.  So yeah that little \npart complaining why she's talking about violence when she is addressing a \ndefinition appropriately...well again I'm confused at your complaint.\n\nThen there is the part where he acts in disbelief when Sommers makes the \ncomment about wanting the male video game culture to die....yet that is \nwhat a slew of articles have headlined in the past month.  While he wants \nmore choice, the majority don't necessarily agree if you look at some of \nthose \"sexist\" titles and see how much money they make in relatively short \nperiods of time.  GTA SA's \"Hot Coffee\" didn't become one of the most \nsearched videos in Youtube because they were serving actual coffee.\n\nSpeaking of denial, Mann then breaks into the tune of \"nobody said they \nmade you sexist, racist, or homophobic.  And yet Sarkessian's videos (hey \nAnna) have done exactly by making a connection between sexism in gaming and \nsexual harassment/culture.  This has since been compounded even more by \nother authors who also attempt to link the two together.\n\nFalse equivalence?  How so?  Oprah has been attacked by gender centered \ncritics for the very fact that black males on her show were more often \nstereotyped as bad in some way.  She also spearheaded calls for men to \nchange from being bad (harassers, wife beaters, etc) while throwing the \nrest of the male population out with the bathwater.  The comparison is \nuncanny.\n\nData?  Do you see that swipe at hipsters with degrees in cultural studies? \nThat's coming from a person with an Ethics Ph.D directing disdain at laymen \n(persons) who try to do poor research. Hence the cherry picking comments \nshe also makes. So about that data.  Well someone actually posted it.  \nhttps://medium.com/@cainejw/the-factual-feminist-a-factcheck-f5ae584f56da\n\nSo basically you've made a song that is complaining that a video called \"Is \ntheir sexism in games?\" should have really been called \"Is there sexism and \nmisogyny in games?\".  Either that or you wanted to focus strictly on sexism \nas a yes or no question which didn't need a video at all.\n\nCatchy tune though.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z125zfbw3tmotbwgx04cflopxzeuzn1xdro0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdm1tKcr5hvcztd9zQsgeFw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-K-9ljT9NnpU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMA/C1kkpEubaKI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "sucksatskating41", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-21T06:36:58.511Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCdm1tKcr5hvcztd9zQsgeFw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.48878400000000005, "formal_score": 95, "updatedAt": "2014-09-21T06:36:58.511Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117295721238463952318", "textDisplay": "Sorry for this lengthy quote, but I think it will prove a point:\n\"Those who most strongly agree that media is just harmless entertainment \nare also the ones most likely to uncritically internalize harmful media \nmessages.\" -Anita Sarkeesian\nTo put it short, she is saying that sexism in video games will cause people \nto be sexist in real life. I agree with you that \"nobody said they made you \nracist or homophobic\" but Anita is definately claiming games make gamers \nsexist. This is also why the factual feminist brought up the point of \nviolence in video games.

Do you think someone, who sees \nan image of a women portrayed sexual manner would devalue women if there \nwasn't a notion that a women is wrong for being open about their sexuality? \nThe fact that we've entered a time, where someone can be open about their \nsexuality and not face obscenity charges, is a step in the right direction. \nYou stop people from looking down on sexualized women, not by calling them \nsluts, or \"self-objectifiers\", but by teaching people that women who are \nsexualized should be a seen as someone who fought through their \ninsecurities and are now comfortable with who they are. Saying these women \nare nothing but sex objects, is on the same level of calling them a slut. \nYou don't resolve this issue by stopping women from being sexualized, you \nsolve it by teaching people that a women who allows herself to be \nsexualized is a positive trait about them.\n\nLike I said, the demographic of triple A titles are still predominantly \nmale. The games being released, with strong female characters, is in \nproportion with how many females are in the triple A market. More of these \ngames aren't going to be made until more women enter the triple A market \nand buy these games with female protagonists. Games with female leads do \nsell well, but not even close to the units that games with male leads do. \n\nWhen games were first being made, they were gender neutral (pong, missile \ndefense, space invaders, tetris etc) and what happened, is that the main \nconsumer of these games were men, so game developers focused their games \nmore on appealing to them. That is why modern games are marketed mainly to \nmale gamers. If you want more games with female leads, then you need more \nwomen in the market for these games, a developer isn't going to make a game \ntargeted toward women unless they know there is an audience for it.

That also plays a big part with the notion that \"sex sells\" \nyou see these images so much because that is what people want and what \nattracts. But I don't think this is wrong, I think the fact that we have \nbecome so comfortable with sexuality for it to be used as this is great. Of \ncourse there always needs to be adjusting, but I think we are heading the \nright way. There have been a slew of songs coming out telling women to be \ncomfortable with themselves. Songs like Bout that bass, Try, and even \nAnaconda, to some extent, celebrate a women's body and natural beauty.\n\n2. If you believe that a man who sees a women in revealing cloths, or a \nsexually active women, will automatically think less of them, then yea, \nthat case would make sense; but, the fact is not all men think that. I \nthink a women who is comfortable with their body and sexuality that they \nare more then willing to show it off, makes me think highly of them. I \nthink it shows that they have overcame their insecurities and that says a \nlot about their character. If anybody thinks negatively of a sexualized \nwomen, they are only doing so because of the stigma that sex is wrong. If \nanything, this is a problem with abstinence programs and the religious \nright, not video games. This is why I don't agree with Anita on why these \ntropes are negative, because they are made under the assumption that a man \nwho sees these images, will think less of a women, and blames that on video \ngames. The solution to this shouldn't be stopping women from being \nsexualized, it's to stop the idea that a sexualized women is a bad thing. \n\n3. I agree, and like I said before, that change is coming, there has been a \nhuge push to redefine what beauty is. \n\nPerhaps you aren't, but I think a feminist who says that a women, who is \nwearing revealing clothing and showing off their body, is doing something \nwrong, is anti-sex. It's telling women that they shouldn't be comfortable \nwith their body and should hide it. \n\nSome games simply don't have the time and resources to flesh out a story \nfor every female, of course that is only a small portion of why that is. I \nthink a major factor, is that games appeal to a demographic that is mostly \nmale. Yes there are women gamers, but most of them are only casual players, \nor play exclusively on mobile phones, so the audience for triple A titles \nare still mostly men. People play games to escape reality, to be able to \nplay as someone else for a while. Part of that is a man being the big buff \nhero that gets all the girls. That's just what men enjoy and I don't see it \nchanging any time soon. As long as this anti-sex stigma is done away with, \nthen no man will think less of a women who sexualized in a game, unless \nthey are an ass hole of course. And for the women that are in the triple A \nmarket, there are still plenty of games with female protagonists that can \nappeal to them. \n\nAgain, I don't see a unified movement in feminism it's hard to research \nwhen there are so many different groups with contradicting ideas.  \n\nYes, the model image being used to define beauty is bad and needs to \nchange, but feminists saying that women shouldn't be sexualized because a \nsexualized women is a bad thing, isn't helping the situation neither. It's \nthe right goal, just the wrong way of going about to achieve it.

Sexualized images in isolation are not bad. What is bad \nis that they dominate all other images of women in media. People are varied \nand complicated, and media should properly reflect that.  \n\n2. No I'm not. Please, do not assume that I (or other feminists) think sex \nis bad, unless explicitly stated. There's a massive difference between \nthinking sex is bad, and thinking media glorification of unrealistic, \nsexualized bodies is bad.\n\nIt's not inherently wrong for men to be attracted to women. But when women \nare valued in media only on the basis of their sexual appeal, and nothing \nelse, it's a big issue, because women are more than just that.\n\n3. Sure, I'm down with having other body types being celebrated, as well as \ncurrently popular body types. But current popular body types also need to \nbe more realistic. Because the images we see are often literally impossible \nto achieve in reality, and are much the product of photoshop. Keep it \nnatural; if you want to value skinny, have it be a realistic, healthy thin.\n\n\nNo, it hasn't become that at all. Modern feminism is not generally \nanti-sex, and certainly not like a lot of religions. Don't try and strawman \nfeminism into something it isn't.\n\nNo, you're making a false equivalency. Complaining about female \nrepresentation in gaming because they are too sexualized is not saying that \na sexy woman is wrong, it's saying that there is more to women than how \nsexy they are, which is something a lot of games forget. Too many games \nhave women that are there ONLY to be sexy, when women are more than that. \nYou can show a woman as sexy; but it shouldn't be her only or defining \nfeature, ideally.\n\nFeminism isn't simple. If you want to really understand it, I suggest you \nsit down and listen to feminists and women and research this stuff. Ideally \nusing sources that aren't distinctly bias against feminism.\n\nAnd our current culture that glorifies unhealthy skinny does a good enough \njob of making women uncomfortable with their bodies without feminism's help."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbBqsQTlZ7SINv-1Yg5dQgQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Guioio GHuippi", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13tgt55wlvlwruly23yxnzplr2pjjhxv04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-28T03:44:12.967Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCbBqsQTlZ7SINv-1Yg5dQgQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.71766599999999992, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-28T03:44:12.967Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113454323522350689119", "textDisplay": "+Quigster23 1.

Men are \nattracted to women and vice versa, just because a women is used to attract \na man is only bad if you think is wrong for a man to be attracted to a \nfemale. \n\n3. So we should get rid of that image? No, not at all, one image has begun \nbeing celebrated, so bring other body types up there with it, don't fight \nto make it so no body type is celebrated or reverse the situation to where \na skinny women is considered unattractive but a larger women is considered \nideal. \n\nModern feminism has become some strange mix of religious anti-sex beliefs \nand some of the old values of past feminist movements.

You don't \nlike one representation, there are others. They get to express \nintelligence, wit, can get themselves o out of situations they are in with \ntheir own agency, etc. They are looked at as fully human and not just there \nto be ogled, or there for one singular purpose. There is also not a problem \nin society with a lack of a variety of men in power positions, in media, in \nculture. Any kind of man you can think of, you've got it. Women are in \nmedia only in limited ways. I'm not sure why this has to be explained. When \nit comes to both men and women, there is a lack of gay representation. So \nfor men I would say \"needs more gay\". Also I believe you have changed the \nsubject unless I'm talking to someone different now. What about that data? \n If you actually sit and watch Anita's videos, which it does not seem like \nyou have, you can take those five tropes (I think it's five) and see which \ngames you play, or which ones are out there that have women that fall \noutside the criteria. Also there's another exercise one can do with films. \nThere's a Bechdel test you can do and it's only to gauge if women are \nactually \"present\" in movies, not if the movie is good or bad or anything, \nit's just to see if these questions can be answered, and you can think \nabout what it means. The questions are. Are there two women in a movie that \nHAVE NAMES, then do they talk to each other and is what they're talking \nabout something other than a man. It's every eye opening. We're half the \npopulation and pretty much missing from major media. What if that was you. \nWhat if all you saw everywhere was women, and you were presented in one of \nfive decorations or uses, most of the time not even with a name? If none of \nthis matters, let's flip the script. Make all the characters in video games \nwomen, and the ones that were females, make those the men. I don't know why \nthis needs to be explained, and I have never talked to an intelligent \nperson in my life that wasn't like \"OH yeah... that is true\"... What is so \nhard to get about this? What is with people bringing up men, when you know \ngood and well it's completely different. Oh  wait you don't know because \nit's completely invisible to you, because you've absorb it. Now cue the \nexcuses for why it should be that way... and I can tell you that most of \nthe excuses will come from this brain washing. Well women are this way, and \nmen do this and women can't do that and men are like this. And where do we \nget these ideas? From our culture, so it feeds on itself.  So yeah, the \npremise is not that video games cause sexism, we have a representation \nproblem in just about all media... it's reinforcing certain ideas, and it's \nexacerbating them. But that alone would not make a person sexist, and she \nnever says it does. \"Are you gonna show us that Data today?\"... -Jonathan \nMann.

Do \nyou think the damsel in distress trope is a good one? Do you think the \namount of scantily clad women in gaming is any cause for concern?<<\n\n1. Is there 'some'? Yes.\n2. Is the trope of a damsel in distress good? Yes & no.\n3. Do I think the amount of 'scantily-clad' women in gaming is any cause \nfor concern? No.\n\nEvery single video game picked out for showing some signs of sexism against \nwomen, anyone that's actually played those video games sees that either the \nmale is portrayed as ultraviolent in those video games and/or the entire \nworld it depicts as a portrayal of real life. At no point whatsoever, while \nthe damsel in distress is always nearly-perfect (if-not-perfect), do we see \na respect of portrayal to the male character.\n\nBeside that, however, every video game aside from the sports & puzzle genre \ntells of a story (yes, that even includes Call of Duty). Someone has to \nactually write that story. No one just comes up and says, \"oh hey guys, \nlet's just do this and make her a damsel in distress since we know women \ncan't fight for themselves.\"\n\nLet's look at one game in particular, Grand Theft Auto. I lived within the \nmetro-Atlanta ghetto for quite a few years (while my family was for several \nyears longer before part of a criminal syndicate elsewhere) and there's no \ndoubt to me those who would call GTA sexist haven't the slightest clue of \nhow women are treated in the underground world.\n\nThen look at Duke Nukem. From its first iteration up to Zero, it's called \nsexist. Why? Because it continues to portray a 1980s/90s-era alien \ninvasion, which would in fact involve scantily-clad women dancing \nstripteasing about.\n\nThen Mario? Like seriously? That's a Nintendo thing anyways. Just Nintendo \nmilking off the younger generation as it always does.\n\nOh but what-about-what-about this or that <insert scantily clad chain \nbikini-wearing heroine>...? This is a considerably-overexaggerated \ncontention. There's only one game that's really even worth mentioning, and \nthat was Tera (maybe WoW I guess, I couldn't be bothered to play it for \nmore than 15 seconds), while most other games are poorly-made Korean or \nChinese F2P ripoffs that hardly anyone worth their money would play to \nbegin with for dozens of other issues. Yes, many games like Skyrim have \nmods, but not only are mods user-created but those that ask nicely know \nthere'll have mods for the other crowd all the same.\n\nI don't even think Mass Effect was good for its customization. Offline, \nnothing beats Skyrim; online, it's between Aion, TESO, & Tera.\n\nWomen in kitchen - http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/get-back-to-the-kitchen"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL9B8H04_EjJJ8HoxwV2_eQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Quigster23", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xivrqrtvfvnocj231tnigfufwx55jn04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T13:23:48.640Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCL9B8H04_EjJJ8HoxwV2_eQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.061034000000000033, "formal_score": 3, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T13:23:48.640Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111400795046868797760", "textDisplay": "+Meijin Ryudrakan Developers don't have to take the views of their \nconsumers if they don't want to, of course.

It'd be \nneat if more games went, say, the Mass Effect route, of having the ability \nto choose a male or female protagonist on a long, story-driven journey, and \nnot have it significantly impact gameplay.\n\nAnd said examples are, I would say, are fairly good ones.\n\nThat being said, if people have qualms with these games for one reason or \nanother, they can, and they may have good reason to.\n\nAnd I have no Idea what you're talking about with the \"women in the \nkitchen\" thing."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYUW2KsMnw0MOYiHpK1PiQ", "inappropriate_score": 1.4260249554367201, "authorDisplayName": "Azihar \u201cMiasma\u201d Vyrakhi", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12xivrqrtvfvnocj231tnigfufwx55jn04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T04:38:10.841Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkYUW2KsMnw0MOYiHpK1PiQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.59549399999999997, "formal_score": 11, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T04:38:10.841Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SIBO3VwbDK4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADb0/kUIUZ2OAGzg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102133403256244659580", "textDisplay": "Why the hell should I as a writer even take someone under consideration \nwhen they've no experience writing?

Even if we made a \nvideo game with every possible female out there, people like her would \ncertainly still complain about the females they don't like being included. \nAnita even has the resources to make her own game by now. But she doesn't \neven attempt it, and instead she like Zoey Quinn called people hateful when \nthey came out voting against Depression Quest.\n\nSpeaking of, you should remember that letter with 2400 signatures. Assuming \nthey were all game creators (which has been debunked), then that's a pretty \ngood size to start their own studio. Don't you think? The largest game \ndevelopment studios run around 2,000 members, yet these 2400 would sign a \npetition talking about a \"need for better treatment\"? Why the fucking hell \ndon't they even start their own indie studios? A single indie studio can be \nas few as a single person, and it'd grow into a standard studio probably at \n500, if not less. A skeleton studio crew in MMORPGs is usually short of 100 \nand over 50. So to even claim there aren't enough resources is a lie.\n\nIt's also one thing for people to criticize, it's another to attack them. \nNothing Anita or the ilk offered has been criticism, and instead we have \nonly seen attack after attack on the basis of a female character either: \nnot being fat enough, showing too much skin/cleavage, being a damsel in \ndistress, or too deadly. At all.\n\nBut that's also ignoring this: every time I and many others get blasted for \nactually advocating for more options, it is always from someone sharing \nthese same fucking ideals as you.

Is it \nnot a valid alternative to just wait for/develop more good games with the \ndemanded character/less stereotyping and support THEM instead of the bad \nstuff you criticize? No wonder so many are opposed.. You are asking them to \nremove/change what they enjoy.\nIt's not like there aren't enough gamers to support different types of \ngames, right?\n\nSure, the gaming industry is doing horribly at adapting to many (especially \nfemale) people wanting less sexist games.. But there's actually a lot of \ndecent ones out there. Have you guys ever played some Japanese RPGs for \nexample? A lot of them have strong female protagonists/character \ndevelopment/hardly any sexism at all. Why aren't those supported more?\n\nLastly, can everyone please stop playing imaginative oppression olympics \nand return to more important issues, like actual human rights abuses \nhappening all over the world?\nIt feels like the entire issue is another example of how well the \"divide \nand conquer\" tactic works.\nThanks for reading.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ge5y5fu3jefpnn23ldfhpglzbypjoh04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 5, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ0Qa8170zKUQtQfAPE8HIQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-B8ff_eDQfak/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/FAJ6ZqSnSao/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 2.7027027027027026, "authorDisplayName": "Damon Gant", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-19T20:49:21.339Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZ0Qa8170zKUQtQfAPE8HIQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.93322769999999999, "formal_score": 83, "updatedAt": "2014-09-19T20:49:21.339Z", "likeCount": 13, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111174691457951954355", "textDisplay": "3:10\n\nYes Anita did say that.\n\"Internalize and perceive as normal\"\n\nYou're full of shit.\n\nCase closed.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuK0ScdY9SZ03U_P_6Wa1Uw", "inappropriate_score": 1.1952191235059761, "authorDisplayName": "Jack Daone", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13ge5y5fu3jefpnn23ldfhpglzbypjoh04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-27T06:38:07.736Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuK0ScdY9SZ03U_P_6Wa1Uw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.6458600000000001, "formal_score": 8, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-08-27T06:40:34.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118328272965910596599", "textDisplay": "+dropkickchannel Too bad the full context of that quote shows that, indeed, \nshe believes(or claims to, anyway) that games with \"sexist \nelements\"(because, in her world, any sort of sexual content is sexist \nbecause she's a sex-negative feminist) cause those playing them to develop \nsexist attitudes. \n\nAnd, as CHS' research pointed out, Sarkeesian is full of shit(just as \nplaying violent video games doesn't make one normalize or \"internalize\" \nviolence, for fuck's sake I've been playing M-rated games since 12 and the \nvery sight of birdstrike aftermaths inside of jet engines makes me want to \nvomit, playing games with \"sexist\" elements to them doesn't make one \nnormalize or \"internalize\" misogyny).

If \nyou don't know how logic works, POSITIVE claims require the burden of \nproof. In other words, we don't have to prove video games as a whole aren't \nsexist, you have to prove they ARE.\"*\n\nYes, and it's Christina Hoff Sommers who makes the negative claim that \nvideo games are NOT sexist. She, like you, is in denial. It is now well \nknown, well established, and well documented that video games in general \nARE sexist, according to the definition of sexism: that is, 1. video game \nindustry is made up of mostly males, is controlled by mostly males and \ndeveloped and played by mostly males. 2. Women are mostly portrayed in most \nvideo games as either sexualized characters, helpless damsels in distress, \nor as secondary unimportant characters. Even when female characters are the \nprotagonists they are usually scantily clad for men's sexual amusement. 3. \nfemale players of online gaming often experience degrading language and \nbehavior towards them in the form of derogatory remarks, sexual insults and \nbullying.\n\nIf women experience these kinds of situations in say, the workplace, or are \nrepresented as bimbos or sexual playthings in say, movies, it's considered \na problem, a problem that goes by the name sexism. Representing females in \na very narrow range of stereotypical or sexual roles, or treating females \nin a lesser or condescending way, or harasing or insulting them online just \nfor being female, is....sexist. Sexism exists in varying degrees throughout \nmany aspects and institutions of society, the video game industry is no \nexception.\n\nTo deny this is happening, or to downplay it's obvious ubiquity in the \ngaming industry is to be deliberately ignorant.\n\nA short list of articles and studies that expose and recognize the problem:\n\nhttp://blog.pricecharting.com/2012/09/emilyami-sexism-in-video-games-study.html\n\nhttp://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/WaiYenTang/20130208/186335/Reactions_to_a_womans_voice_in_an_FPS_game.php\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/art-imitating-life-how-sexism-in-video-games-mirrors-real-life-gender-imbalance-8381426.html\n\nhttp://www.digitalamerica.org/the-male-domain-exclusion-of-women-in-video-games-kayleigh-connor/\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/teenage-boys-sexist-video-games\n\nhttp://mic.com/articles/121528/sexism-in-gaming#.CmOC2w861\n\nhttp://www.cracked.com/article_22670_the-5-most-unbelievably-sexist-quests-in-video-game-history.html\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27824701\n\nhttp://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/gender-society/internet-harassment-online-threats-targeting-women-research-review\n\nhttp://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/game-on-women-are-developing-new-video-games-and-a-new-culture/\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/29/gaming-vlogger-anita-sarkeesian-is-forced-from-home-after-receiving-harrowing-death-threats/\n\n\n*\"3: She is saying that to stop people from asserting that she hates them \nbased on the fact that she's arguing with them.\"*\n\nNo, she simply fails to say which points are the good ones made by critics. \nThe video points this omission out. That's why her statement is fatuous.\n\n*\"4: It's clear that by inclusive she means of all females, in having \nfemale characters and having games that appease everyone. Many of the games \nAnita points out are designed for males because females typically don't \nlike that. Anita herself has admitted that she doesn't like to play violent \ngames. It's called sexual dimorphism. The designers would rather go all out \non something males would enjoy to get lots of sales that way than go for a \nmiddleground that really appeases nobody (that's what usually happens \nanyways)\"*\n\nNo, what Sommers means by inclusive isn't clear at all, at least not from \nher video. 'Inclusive' is a buzzword. If it means creating more female \ncharacters or protagonists, that's fine but it wouldn't necessarily mean \nthe games would be less sexist. Sexual dimorphism is a physical ratio \nbetween male and female body mass. It has nothing to do with what type of \ngames men and women are attracted to playing.\n\n\n*\"5: It's called targeted demographics. It may be a bit sexist, but it \nisn't women hating (misogynistic). No the female characters aren't there \nfor distraction, they're often there for story reasons, but end up looking \nsexy because it's APPEASING A DEMOGRAPHIC. Your problem is that you see \nchoices that are used to make money, and because they appease men more that \nwomen call it sexism. The intent is what matters here.\"*\n\nYes, \"it may be a bit sexist'. At least you seem to be now admitting sexism \nexists. Dismissing the sexism by explaining it away in terms of capitalist \ndemographics and marketing doesn't change this fact. Representations of \nwomen as mainly sexual objects and/or minor characters because males like \nit that way is precisely why it is sexism. Back when women were considered \nthe property of men, and before women were allowed to vote, men set up the \nlaws and rules and social norms of society, as well as how women should or \nshouldn't behave, because that's the way the male 'demographic' liked it.\n\n\n*\"6: Yes, see #1. Where is your fucking evidence. You make the positive \nclaim, you make the burden of proof.\"*\n\nNobody is claiming video games 'make' people sexist (they may already be \nthat way), misogynist, or homophobic -- the latter are irrelevant side \nissues. The subject is general sexism in the video game industry, not \nhomophobia or misogyny.\n\n\n*\"7: What do you mean false equivalence. They are both products catering to \nthe wants and needs of one gender in order to make more money. I could \neasily make a claim that Oprah is sexist because it makes choices that \nwomen like more than men, but then I would be ignoring their intent of \nmaking money.\"*\n\nExcept Oprah isn't depicting men in narrow stereotypical roles, or treating \nthem as unimportant people, as sex objects, bimbos, or insulting and \nharrasing them online.\n\n\n*\"8: She's claiming experience. Not the best argument, but not worth \ndestroying her credibiliy over.\"*\n\nSommers' reputation wasn't \"destroyed\" by this video response. Her ideas \nwere critiqued in a playful way through song.\n\n\n*\"9: You are pointing to a vocal minority. 'Cherrypicking', I think it's \ncalled.

If you \ndon't know how logic works, POSITIVE claims require the burden of proof. In \nother words, we don't have to prove video games as a whole aren't sexist, \nyou have to prove they ARE.\n\n\n2: Yes, I will admit to that. I personally take it as a light insult, but \nthat I'll give you.\n\n\n3: She is saying that to stop people from asserting that she hates them \nbased on the fact that she's arguing with them.\n\n\n4: It's clear that by inclusive she means of all females, in having female \ncharacters and having games that appease everyone. Many of the games Anita \npoints out are designed for males because females typically don't like \nthat. Anita herself has admitted that she doesn't like to play violent \ngames. It's called sexual dimorphism. The designers would rather go all out \non something males would enjoy to get lots of sales that way than go for a \nmiddleground that really appeases nobody (that's what usually happens \nanyways)\n\n\n5: It's called targeted demographics. It may be a bit sexist, but it isn't \nwomen hating (misogynistic). No the female characters aren't there for \ndistraction, they're often there for story reasons, but end up looking sexy \nbecause it's APPEASING A DEMOGRAPHIC. Your problem is that you see choices \nthat are used to make money, and because they appease men more that women \ncall it sexism. The intent is what matters here.\n\n\n6: Yes, see #1. Where is your fucking evidence. You make the positive \nclaim, you make the burden of proof.\n\n\n7: What do you mean false equivalence. They are both products catering to \nthe wants and needs of one gender in order to make more money. I could \neasily make a claim that Oprah is sexist because it makes choices that \nwomen like more than men, but then I would be ignoring their intent of \nmaking money.\n\n\n8: She's claiming experience. Not the best argument, but not worth \ndestroying her credibiliy over.\n\n\n9: You are pointing to a vocal minority. 'Cherrypicking', I think it's \ncalled.

In other words, she admits most \ngames feature male heroes and any female characters that appear, are \nusually only there for sexual distraction....in other words, that is what \nsexism is.

They don't really care about your age, your race, your \nethnicity, your gender, your sexual preference, etc.\" all the while actual \ntweets from gamers are posted on the video which directly refute what she \nis saying.

After \ndecades of struggling, we finally managed to gain acceptance from the wider \nmainstream. But now gamergate is setting us back 20 years, back to the days \nwhen \"gamer\" was a derogotary term.\n\nSpeaking of \"casual\" games, the irony is that a lot of the \"AAA\" games that \nso-called \"hardcore\" gamers play today are not \"hardcore\" at all, but are \nwhat gamers back in the 90's would have described as \"casual\" games. And \nyet these same people we called \"casuals\" back then are today calling \nthemselves \"hardcore\" and looking down their noses at the next group of \n\"casual\" gamers to join the hobby. And even more ironically, most of the \n\"AAA\" games they call \"hardcore\" today are a lot easier than the \"casual\" \ngames they're deriding. The likes of COD are no less \"casual\" than the \nlikes of Flabby Bird.

Or did you interview every single person whose tweet you quoted?\nFurthermore, showing those tweets over her claims that gamers, in short, \naren't sexist harassers, therefore implying that gamers *are*, in fact, \nsexist harassers, is rather dishonest. What do you know about these people? \nDo they even identify as gamers? 'cause if they don't, nothing they say is \nactually relevant to this discussion.\n\nAlso, you said that \"Nobody said [games] made you sexist [...]\", but let's \njust take Anita Sarkeesian's series \"Tropes vs Women in Video Games\" as an \nexample. In the very first video, she says the following:\n\"[...]The Damsel in Distress trope [...] does help to normalize extremely \ntoxic, patronizing and paternalistic attitudes about women.\"\nIgnoring the fact that the usage of the word \"normalize\" isn't correct in \nthis context, she's saying that games make sexist attitudes and opinions \nabout women as a whole more acceptable to gamers. While this isn't quite \nthe same as \"they make gamers sexist\", it isn't exactly a huge leap either.\n\nAnd to ape your questions of \"What points?\", \"What data?\", \"What gamers?\", \nI'd like you to conclusively prove that \"most AAA games are full of sexist \ntropes\". And no cherry-picking, so I'd like you to look at all AAA games \nand show that the ones with sexist tropes make up over 50%. Only then will \nI accept your claim.\nMind you, I'm not saying that you're *wrong*. I'm just using your rhetoric.\n\nYour response to her saying that \"male gamers [...] evince a strong \npreference for games with male heroes and sexy women\" didn't make much \nsense. You claim that that implies that \"games are sexist\".\nHow?\nJust because it has a male hero? Or a sexy woman? That doesn't \nautomatically make a game sexist. If the male characters in the game were \nstrong, independent guys who don't take any shit from anyone and the female \ncharacters were weak, subservient and had basically no relevance beyond \ntheir sexiness, then yes, the game is sexist.\nThere's other ways for a piece of media to be sexist, of course, but just \nhaving a male hero and a sexy woman is *definitely* not enough, contrary to \nwhat you claimed.\n\nAlso, her last point that you addressed was that critics of gamers as a \nwhole should stand down. To that, you say that you will not stand down, \nmeaning that you'll... continue to criticize gamers? For what? For \nharassing people?\nThere's two important things wrong with this claim.\n\nFirst of all, that the harassers were gamers.\nTwitter accounts that harass these feminists usually get shut down rather \nquickly, so it's easier to look at their most inflammatory and vocal \ncritics. Milo Yiannopoulos, for example, used the controversy surrounding \nZoe Quinn and GamerGate to promote a very hateful anti-feminist agenda. \nFrom what I've been able to find, he is not a gamer and has never written \nabout games before. I doubt he's the only non-gamer criticizing these \npeople and saying that everyone who wrote these death threats and similar \nare gamers is plain wrong.\nOf course, you're probably thinking \"Cherry-picking!\" to yourself, but that \nleads me to the second false conclusion.\n\nSecondly, that these harassers are in some way representative of gamers as \na whole.\nI hope I don't have to point out how absolutely ludicrous this idea is. I'm \nwilling to bet that most gamers aren't even aware of the controversy or of \nthese feminist video game critics. I've asked some people that I know \npersonally who play games regularly and are certainly enthusiastic about \nthem. None of them knew what I was talking about.\nFrom what I've been able to tell, most gamers who know about the \ncontroversy and the harassment are very much for inclusivity and strongly \noppose harassment.\n\nSo, all in all, I don't quite understand the meaning of \"We will not stand \ndown.\" in response to what she said.\nUnless you meant that you will continue to advocate less sexism, less \nharassment and having more games that approach issues in different, \ninteresting ways?\nIf you meant *that*, then that's great! I'm all for that!\nBut it has *absolutely nothing* to do with what she said.\n\nHowever, I do agree that the title of her video is rather misleading.\nAnd that was *definitely* a Totally Sweet Guitar Break.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13zwlajipzqxpvs2234ir2j5wblhzutj": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl":

You are assuming groups of people all share \nspecific interests and have you chosen to speak for them. You know nothing \nabout the people you are speaking for. Let them speak for themselves. If \nthey exist, they have a mouth that they can use - and as shown by recent \nevents they have chosen their sides and many are not behind the cause you \nbelieve in. They don't need you to speak for them anymore, they've done it \nand are still doing it themselves on both sides of the fence.\n   On the race topic. Not all straight white guys like Gears of War. Not \nall black people dislike Gears of War. Same for homosexuals and every other \ngroup out there. You can't assume that all the people you speak for, \nwithout their permission, agree with you or even want you to speak for \nthem. As the saying goes, \"to assume is to make an ass out of u and me.\"\n\n   As for it being unequal and unfair, those can be mutually exclusive. \nJust because something is unequal doesn't make it unfair, and vice versa. I \nthink there is some inequality in games, but there is also inequality in \nthe people who play games. Not every game can bow to every demand from \nevery group. Some games should be made to be inclusive but those that \naren't should not be pressured to conform to the standards of small but \nvocal groups that they never specifically intended to target.\n\n   I think it's a shame that people don't get to represent themselves in \ngaming as much as they'd like but on the same note I'd like to point out \nthat to a lot of people representing them self doesn't matter. I guess I'm \nkind of old when it comes to games, but more often I make a character and \ninsert myself into their role instead of making a character and inserting \nmy personality into them. I identify as bisexual, but if a game doesn't let \nme convey that then I don't think it's a huge issue - it's how they made \nthe game after all and I respect their decision. If I dislike something in \na game so much it bothers me personally I'll move on to another one.\n\n   I think the assumption that people should have to change what they are \nmaking to appeal to larger or smaller groups is silly. A developer should \nbe able to make anything they please for whoever they want without fear of \nbeing personally ridiculed for what he or she has made. When a developer \nchanges what they've put in a game because of pressure from external groups \nthat means their creativity is being pushed into a box of what is \nacceptable or not. They COULD stand by their decision - and be ridiculed, \nblacklisted, and even sent threats - or they could sacrifice their \ncreativity to appeal to a large, hostile audience who wants it their way or \nnot at all."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL9B8H04_EjJJ8HoxwV2_eQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Quigster23", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13vx5gxwnzmgbrm522bily4dvarffq5f04", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-19T23:51:28.419Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCL9B8H04_EjJJ8HoxwV2_eQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.0059540000000000148, "formal_score": 35, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-19T23:51:28.419Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111400795046868797760", "textDisplay": "+Zach Woodruff The point a lot of people are making is that the video game \nindustry, at least the AAA, tends to cater to the interests of certain \ngroups of people (straight, white men) over other groups, and that's \nunequal and unfair.

(And If the point of the feminists isn't that \nsexist tropes makes gamers sexist, then what is the point? Anita thinks \nthey do, \"the more you think you aren't affected by it, the more likely you \nactually are\") Sommers goes on the mention that millennial males, the type \nthat have grown up playing video games, are less prone than ever to the \nprejudices that feminists are worried about. You cut this bit of-course, \nand while I'm on the subject of cherry picking, if you think that those \ntweets you show are representative of gamers on general, all I can say is \nthat simply isn't so and shame on you for implying that they are. Are \nstereotypes only ok when they're being directed at gamers? Anita and her \nsupporters, along with the gaming press, seem to think so.

(I know you did not say that, but it's something I \nfrequently come across).\n\nThat's not to say women don't experience sexism. And that when it does, it \ndoesn't warrant attention and support.

So much of the vileness takes a sexist nature, especially \nwhen you're the woman, and there's a reason for it. Sexism is a part of our \nculture, and perhaps especially of gaming culture.\n\n------\nGenerally, I'd say it's another issue of culture as a whole. I think we \neducate people relatively well (compared to sexism) about violence and \ncrime. More people have understandings that these things are generally \nwrong, why they are wrong, and that violence and crime will lead you to \nbeing justifiably and suitably punished.\n\nI think our society does a much poorer job of this with sexism, and \nsay, rape. Our society is still very gendered, and our society does a lot \nto maintain these boundaries. People grow up with a lot of issues and \nconfusion about the expectations of our gender, and society doesn't \ndo enough to help with that. This contributes to a lot of awful, sexist \nbehaviour, such as when men try to fulfill the whole macho-mode of \nmasculinity that usually involves sexism.\n\nWhen a game about violence shows up, then, a gamer can more easily separate \nthemselves from it, because they have a better understanding of violence \ngiven to them by society. But because people are less informed about \nsexism, games that include sexist elements have more possibility to \nre-enforce bad ideas and behaviour.\n\nThis is largely just my critical thinking at play, and isn't backed up \nby say, a study, of course (as are most opinions about this topic, despite \npeople's predisposition to judge everyone for not having hard evidence when \nit is convenient for them to do so).\n\n-----\nWell, fantasizing a lot about bad behaviour, and graphically, could be a \nsign of mental health issues, depending on how these thoughts are making \nyou feel.

She doesn't speak of any of the \"good points\" she \nmentions, which leaves 3 possible scenarios:\n1) They're not relevant to the topic at hand (unlikely, as she's talking \nabout sexism)\n2) She doesn't want to address them (possible, it would bloat the video and \nalmost all talking points have been done to death)\n3) She's lying and thinks there are no good points raised, but says a vague \nstatement to avoid debate (possible, see point 2)\nAll of these are bad for the side which is meant to have good points. At \nbest, it's to focus the video. At worst, it's because all raised points are \ncrap. Pointing them out would only sidetrack the video's point.\n\n2:21 You don't even TRY to tackle the main point here, and just vaguely say \nthere's a \"few games\" with fleshed out female protagonists. Well, apart \nfrom this entire part being massively insulting to the writers of such \ngames, immediately painting \"most triple A game\" writers as sexists, you... \ndon't address anything at all? See, this is where you mention or show \ncounter examples to the ones which are shown in her video. Instead, you \nflippantly throw it off and say that MOST AAA games are \"full of sexist \ntropes\" according to critics. Your point is just as mindlessly vague as \nhers at best, and supported by less evidence at worst. Again, a potential \npoint which you just fail to capitalise on at all.\n\n2:52 So, men associating more with men and the majority of men being \nheterosexual is sexist? And she's saying \"boys will be boys\" by stating \nthat the publishers are targeting a demographic? Or perhaps you believe \ntargeted demographics are, in and of themselves, sexist? None of these \npoints make any sense. Your \"own\" view doesn't even conflict with her view \nat all - at absolutely no point does she say or even insinuate there should \nbe more or less choice. It doesn't even come up. Your own point has nothing \nto do with sexism even - a demographic being more comprised of one gender \nthan another is not indicative of sexism. If there's proof that there's \ndeliberate, exclusionary behaviour targeted against a gender, sure, that's \nsexism. You don't mention that at all though - you just completely \nmisrepresent her point. If anything, you represent the people she's \ndebating - ones who believe appealing to one gender instead of another is \ninherently sexist. It's not, and never will be - this doesn't stand up at \nall, even the \"critics\" you wish to represent don't argue that, rather that \nin these targetted games the women are objectified, which is very different.\n\n3:09 Actually, yes they did. I don't even know how you missed it - it's the \nwhole point of Anita's kickstarter even, she mentions in that first video \nshe aims to show how video games are making people sexist. You might want \nto actually watch the videos of the critics you support before trying to \n(mis)represent their views some more.\n\n3:24 False equivalence? Is it? So gender critics making attacks on female \ntargeted media is in absolutely no way comparable to gender critics making \nattacks on male targeted media? Really? I would just LOVE to know your \nreasoning behind this. Is it because in your mind most video games aren't \nmale targeted? Come on, this point isn't even worth the space it fills in \nthe video.\n\n3:41 Even a tertiary glance at her twitter would show she's been engaging \nin the whole #gamergate thing, which has included talking to gamers. Not \nthat she should need to even back up such a vague statement anyway, as the \namount of people designating themselves a \"gamer\" is a huge number \nnowadays, which includes everyone from my girlfriend to my mother. Unless, \nof course, you'd like to distinguish for yourself who the people \"worthy\" \nof the gamer tag are? I'm sure that'll go down like a house on fire after \nall.\n\n\"Do you have \"data\" that says a lot of games aren't sexist\" is probably the \nmost hilariously stupid thing I've heard for a while. That's like going \n\"oh, well do you have \"data\" that says you're NOT racist?\" or \"do you have \n\"data\" that says people AREN'T all murderers waiting for the right moment?\" \nNot only is it an incredibly loaded question in and of itself, it's almost \nimpossible to prove a negative as anyone with a basic understanding of the \nworld would know. Once again, the burden of proof is not with her and, \nassuming she's not lying for no reason, it's almost certainly fair to say \nshe's had exposure to the supposedly sexist demographic you're so keen to \ndecry due to her twitter and video content. Given that fact, it seems more \nthan a little bizarre to ask her for more data still, even if it could be \nprovided.\n\nAnd your coup de gr\u00e2ce is what? Cherry picked tweets? Amazing. I can find \nsimilar ones aimed at TotalBiscuit. Surely evidence of misandry, right? \nHey, how about the torrents of hatred from Leigh Alexander at a trans kid? \nClearly all video game journalists are transphobic bullies, right? See, the \nthing is you've shown that some people are horrible on the internet with \nthose tweets. Congratulations. Anyone who's been on Omegle, a chatroom, or \nhey, even a text repository from the 90s could have told you that years \nago. Have you shown there's sexism from gamers? No. Have you addressed the \nmajority of the gaming community? No. Have you even shown any correlation \nat all? No. Literally all you did is show some awful tweets. Well, \ncongratulations - now why is that being conflated (note: an actual false \nlink, unlike misogyny and violence which as you kindly show here at last \nARE linked) to ALL games and gamers without a single iota of academic \nresearch? Where's any data supporting you at all?\n\nIn summary: you don't discredit any of her points, you don't show any \nsupporting facts for your own side and the majority of the video is you \npulling funny faces to try and make an academic look dumb. Well, \ncongratulations, you're this weeks winner of \"pointless shit I wish I \nhadn't bothered to view\". You topped watching a baked bean can timelapse, \nso that's some accomplishment. Basically, I'm saying you need to actually \nmake counter arguments and know what you're talking about if you bother to \ndo anything like this again.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRf9-XNa2fdnmVNGQXakrpQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "DuckieMcduck", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13kwvwp0y34zvlwq04cd13wurngfl2rrbc", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-22T01:19:26.666Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRf9-XNa2fdnmVNGQXakrpQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.42470999999999998, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-22T01:19:26.666Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2bfU-BvEnvU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/DFxSA06K0Io/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100940710210458600738", "textDisplay": "If I could favorite youtube comments, this would be one of them."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOKawvaYHqw9NLZPFmDafIA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TastehBred", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13kwvwp0y34zvlwq04cd13wurngfl2rrbc", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-21T00:57:38.683Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOKawvaYHqw9NLZPFmDafIA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.38027999999999995, "formal_score": 91, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-21T00:57:38.683Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114192588005761560368", "textDisplay": "+Arysta Your thought process is as follows:\n-This guy has opinions that differ from mine.\n-I cannot or don't have the capacity to debate these opinions.\n-I'll just make up an excuse to not consider these opinions."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjNmTapO8QC2teYiS7KnzCA", "inappropriate_score": 1.0526315789473684, "authorDisplayName": "Hershel Hyam", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13kwvwp0y34zvlwq04cd13wurngfl2rrbc", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-20T10:56:59.613Z", "likeCount": 3, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCjNmTapO8QC2teYiS7KnzCA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.667354, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-09-20T10:56:59.613Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110565288188694133743", "textDisplay": "+Arysta\nYou're making fun of him for caring about something that he likes, not to \nmention defending himself against your accusation of sexism as well as many \nothers such as Anita Sarkeesian.

That would be \nantithetical to your previous statement.

Some might say that's not enough, there are \nmore the rebooted Lara Croft she's perfect and its always on PC (so if we \nreally need to see her naked or with big boobs again we can just mod the \ngame wich is still wrong but I don't know some people like weird things \nthat's why freedom is important).\nMore games: Life is Strange, Alien Isolation, Child of Light, Resident Evil \nRevelations 2 altough it wasn't so good but still better than RE6, then \nthere are RPGs, we have Dragon Age Inquisition u can make a female lead she \ncan be awesome as you play her, Skyrim another RPG where u can do that. I \nthink my point is proven.\nFIY feminazis, there are good feminists that like to play as male \nprotagonists and despise playing with female protagonists, I have a \npersonal friend that does exactly that and I like to play with \nfemale protagonists a lot, but we don't want to force creators to change \nthey will change with the market, if games with man start failing they will \ntry new things with females on 1st.

There is \na reason why gamers ( mostly male ) are so toxic because you have to be on \ntop of the game all the time. The very being of perfection.\n\nHow often do we play characters who are in bad shape? Almost never. All the \ncharacters are mostly in good or godlike condition.

It is a problem that was long \ncaused by the fact that the market was male market mostly. Surely though it \nis evident that there is a market for woman games though.\n\nIs sexist portrayals of characters always a bad thing? No they are not. \nFantasy genre relies feeding our most profound desires in every aspect. \nWhether it is muscular men or sexy woman. A man power fantasy or a female \npower fantasy. I do not think that it would be bad to have fantasy like \nelements to fantasy like games.\n\nBut I do say that there are always all kinds of fantasies and not every \ngame has to be a fantasy game even though games are usually fantasies about \nsomething.\n\nOh and no.

The fact that there is a lack of evidence \nof the claims made is in fact is her evidence.\n\n Second those tweets are mean but she has it coming. See I don't have to go \nto you twitter account to tell you how stupid you are being I can make a \ncomment right here. Although in femfreq comments are off, ratings are off. \nShe is able to say all the shit you wants and no one is able to dislike it \nor comment on the flaws. So what do they do? They tweet her calling her a \nbitch. Also this is the fucking internet!!!  If you are not called a bitch \nwho fucks his dog all day as a panda is raping your dad and making your mom \nplay a song at gun point then you are not on the internet. Do you think \nMartin Luther King Jr. never faced someone yelling at him? Calling him \nnames? If you are really trying to change something you have to look past \nall the insults and keep moving forward. But see the difference is MLK \nactually was fighting for something real. There was proof, you could just \nlook at the two water fountains as proof. There is no proof that video \ngames are causing sexism same as there is no proof that video games are \ncausing violent crimes. The fact I have no proof doesn't make me wrong, you \nare the one who has to bring the proof.\n\nAlso please do your some fact checking before you make a video as stupid as \nthis. First femfreq has talked about violence to women in games. Second \nfemfreq said once in there video, the more you think a game is not \naffecting you the more it really is. For this to be held true it must be \nlooked at all examples and if one shows to be wrong then most likely they \nare all wrong. So why choose violence? Well that is an easy thing to look \nup. If this is true you should see an increase in crime so you should \nexcept that crime rate has gone up, also for sexism rape should go up too. \nWell look at this link\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-33\nCrimes have gone down, rape has gone down. Also I don't have a study of \nthis but there has not been mass murder of turtles by jumping on them. When \nthere is a flag pole people do not try to jump on the top. There hasn't \nbeen a huge increase of running over hookers with your car. There has not \nbeen an increase of people running around eating white dots.\n\nSo stand down because you have no clue what you are singing about. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13bztny4lq1frs2a22oxjkjbnfnjddew": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyavZWjSPkWyKKalbV4O_6Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "W Brown", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-25T11:12:03.177Z", "videoId": "-K4s7cV4Us4", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCyavZWjSPkWyKKalbV4O_6Q"}, "sentiment_score": 0.67731199999999991, "formal_score": 90, "updatedAt": "2014-09-25T11:13:32.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100711072094404090476", "textDisplay": "Vocal-training...

Also you can't talk about sexism in games without talking about which \nsex plays a type of game.  They are two different ideas but you can't focus \non one without addressing the other. The ideas of misogyny and violence she \ntalks about are the claims that the games make men more into the idea of \noppressing women and abuse toward women.  Considering that these are both \nthings Anita brings up in her Tropes videos I doubt this is the first time \nyou've heard these two things brought up together. Her talking about \nviolence in GTA and Cod is the fact that no one has been able to prove that \nmedia has changed a persons personality or behavior unless they already had \nissues or wanted the change themselves. It's basically if games don't make \nyou violent why would they make you misogynistic or violent against women? \nThose would be \"good questions\" if AAA games were the only genres of games \nout there.  If games like GTA and CoD were the only games in the world then \nyes it would be a good question why aren't they more inclusive or focus on \n\"male power fantasies\".  That isn't the case.  AAA is a small part of \ngaming. There are plenty of different genres out there for everyone to find \ngames to play.  If you don't like AAA games with that kind of thing in \nthere find the AAA games that don't have it or try other games.  So should \nwe take out all sexy women in games?  Wouldn't that be working backwards? \n I'm pretty sure there's plenty of women that worked hard to not be ashamed \nof they're bodies and the right to wear  what they want or practice the \nkind of sexuality that they want. What about story telling?  Should we \nlimit how a story writer does their job to make sure no one has they're \nfeelings hurt? I agree with her.  The majority of gamers I know are great \npeople who just want to play games.  This is coming from someone who has \nplayed video games since the 80's, attended 2 schools for gaming (one for \ndev and one for art) and am now currently teaching at a school for game \ndesign and still playing with people online with men and women. Gaming has \nmore than enough choice in it.  It's like any other kind of media out \nthere. Her Oprah example was a bit weak honestly.  A better example, i \nthink, would be saying that we should change action movies to have more \nwomen main characters or less violence.  Or Tyler Perry movies to have more \nwhite people in them. Or romantic comedies to have more action in them to \nappeal to men. Demographics exist and while we may not like what another \ndemographic finds entertaining that doesn't give us the right to tell them \nto change what they like or make up false accusations of sexism or \nmisogyny.  Don't get me wrong I love games like The Last of Us, Remember \nMe(how many of you bought that one), The Walking Dead, Bioshock Infinite \nand others that have well rounded female characters that can handle their \nown and saves their male counterparts just as often as them being saved. I \nthink we could always use more games like these because these are the games \nwe remember the most fondly. But to take away the others or censor or judge \nthem or whatever because we simply don't like them is messed up.  I also \nlove healthy well made food but that doesn't mean I also don't love a \ngreasy burger. A nice greasy burger like Dead or Alive. As for fact \nchecking here's someone that fact checks Dr Sommers work and does a really \ngood job of it. \n\nhttps://medium.com/@cainejw/the-factual-feminist-a-factcheck-f5ae584f56da\n\nThe song was passable btw.
