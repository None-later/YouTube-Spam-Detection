True capitalism is something \nthat works but we have not had that for a long time in this country rather \nwe have had the \"social capitalism\" you speak of. When you have 10% of the \npopulation paying 70% of the taxes (not made up this can be verified at \nIRS.gov) and roughly 47% of the population not paying anything you end up \nwith what we have, companies leaving the country and wealthy renouncing \ntheir citizenship at the highest rate ever in our history. Fairness is a \npipe dream. Nothing in life is fair. Some are born with greater talents, \nsome make better decisions, some are just plain lucky. Why should I work \nhard and study to get good grades so that someone else benefits from my \nhard work when they are too lazy or lack the brain power to do so? Now \nthere are cases where we need to help out people like those born with birth \ndefects or the mentally retarded but if you're an able bodied individual \nthen you should earn your own and not rely on someone else. Remember the \nold adage that \"a government big enough to give you everything is also big \nenough to take it all away\". Just look at the abysmal failure that \nobamacare is. Still the same number of unemployed. Only a handful of \ninsurance choices and rates going up at an alarming rate. Rather than that \nthey should allow insurance companies to sell across state lines, open up \ncompetition and let the free market offer better solutions. But no, the \ngovernment stuck their fingers in it and screwed it all up. Name one thing, \njust one, the government does well, efficiently and effectively. You can't. \nLook at the VA. Our vets are waiting years for treatment and dying in the \nprocess because of bloated government bureaucracy. And yes, what you \ndescribed is communism. \"From each according to his ability, to each \naccording to his need\" is exactly what you described. You have failed to \nlearn anything from history."}}]}, "z12murh5zoesgh15004cfhxilvzbzly44mo0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqHmRjyYb41oTzAVCY-cx7g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "pantslizard", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-04-17T17:19:43.415Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqHmRjyYb41oTzAVCY-cx7g"}, "sentiment_score": -0.78560999999999992, "formal_score": 39, "updatedAt": "2015-04-17T17:19:43.415Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116610752690792325193", "textDisplay": "The charges against the \"Hutaree Militia\" were dismissed and they were all \ngiven time served.

It would be hard to top the overwhelming bias \nthat exists in this piece. For starters they frame the discussion as \nislamic terror vs. right wing terror. Why is left wing terrorism \ninexplicably left out of it. The video starts off with Jared Laughner, most \nof his friends described him as liberal. \n\nThis whole video is based on some study they did comparing islamic terror \n(26 dead) & right wing terror (48 dead). It was updated to include the \ncharleston shooting. Most of it is a stretch to even call it terrorism. A \nfew of them are armed robberies that ended up with people getting killed \nbut the perpetrators said they were going to use the money to fund whatever \npolitical agenda/group. Thats still just a robbery. Another one was a \ndomestic violence call where the guy killed the cops who showed up but he \nexpressed anti-government views so ya know, terrorism! If they are going to \ncount the white supremacist assholes shouldnt they count the black panther \n& other pro black assholes that killed people. What about the two cops \nexecuted in the ferguson aftermath. \n\nAnyway this so called list of 26 dead by islamic terror since 9/11, because \nof course we're leaving that one off the list, also left a few others off \nthe list. The DC Sniper killed 17 so that makes 43. The TV executive in New \nYork who cut his wife's head off in 2009, thats 44.

You got that information from a \nright-wing blog (really reliable source). And can you tell me how many \npeople Bill Ayers killed? I believe that number is zero. He destroyed \nproperty, didn't target and kill human beings like the right-wingers. 1. \nNidal Hasan (the Ft. Hood shooter) lived in either Virginia (his state of \nresidence prior to being sent to Ft. Hood) or Texas, neither of which has \npartisan registration. Therefore the claim that he was a \"registered \nDemocrat\" is false. I do not know if he voted or how he voted, but I do \nknow that unless he was registered in a state in which he did not reside, \nthat the claim that he is a registered Democrat is FALSE.\n2. Since Virginia does not have partisan registration there is also no way \nto tell whether Seung-Hui Cho was a Democrat, but again because there is no \npartisan registration in the state we can say that the claim that he is a \nregistered Democrat is FALSE. (Update: A more obvious point is that Cho was \na resident alien, not a US citizen, so he was not eligible to vote in the \nUS)\n3. The false allegation that James Holmes was a registered Democrat was \nbased on a Breitbart blogger named Joel Pollack, who found voter \nregistration records for a DIFFERENT James Holmes who was approximately the \nsame age as the shooter James Holmes. Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars and other \nright-wing websites then incredulously repeated the false information \nwithout verifying it. It was later determined that the Colorado Theater \nShooter James Holmes was NOT registered to vote, as evidenced by this \nretraction: {Newly-released information on the suspect\u2019s birthdate (which, \nas indicated in our initial report, was a slight mismatch), combined with \nnew details Breitbart News has obtained about the suspect\u2019s likely \naddresses, together suggest that the suspect may, in fact, not have been \nregistered to vote.}. However, most conservative bloggers continued to \npromote the lie without printing the Breitbart site's retraction. The claim \nthat James Holmes was a registered Democrat is FALSE.\n4. The claim that Adama Lanza is a registered Democrat has been suggested \nbased not on any evidence that he was registered as one, but on the rather \ndubious claim that because Connecticut has almost 2 to 1 Democratic \nregistration over Republicans, he was probably a Democrat. (Claim: \"Adam \nLanza, NewtownConn murderer. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by \nabout a 2-1 ratio in Connecticut. The odds are therefore that the Lanza \nfamily are (sic) Democrats.\") This of course is a bogus argument to begin \nwith, but even if we were to make the claim that a mass shooter\u2019s political \naffiliation must be the same as the majority of the people in his area, we \ncan debunk this foolish idea by taking this shoddy analysis down to the \nlocal level. Yes, Connecticut voted for Barack Obama, BUT the city of \nNewtown voted for Mitt Romney. If we look at the results we find that Mitt \nRomney defeated Barack Obama in Newtown by 7451-6784 votes or 51.7 percent \nto 47 percent. Republican Senate candidate and Tea Party favorite Linda \nMcMahon carried the city over Democrat Chris Murphy by an even larger \nmargin. Add in the other information we have that Lanza\u2019s mother was a \n\u201cdoomsday prepper\u201d and a home schooler in a Republican-leaning city and we \ncan pretty well dispense with the erroneous assumption that Lanza must have \nbeen a Democrat (According to at least one media source, Nancy Lanza was a \nregistered Republican. The source does not provide a link, but the author \nof this article is seeking further confirmation). We can therefore claim \nthat with no evidence to support the claim, the assertion that Lanza was a \nDemocrat is not demonstrated and that in the absence of any evidence it is \nlikely FALSE.\n5. Klebold and Harris of course were not old enough to vote and they had no \napparent political affiliation. Allegations that they came from families of \nDemocrats or liberal progressives appear to have no sources to substantiate \nthose claims. What little ideology the boys demonstrated owed mostly to an \nadmiration for Timothy McVeigh not Ted Kennedy. Harris\u2019 father was a \nretired Air Force pilot and Eric Harris wanted to join the Marine Corps. \nThe boys lived in Littleton, Colorado a relatively conservative and \naffluent suburb of Denver. The claim that their parents were Democrats is \nUNSUBSTANTIATED. Any suggestion that the two boys were Democrats is \ndemonstrably FALSE.\nInterestingly, Hedgecock and those on the far right have conveniently \noverlooked a number of cases where ideology is clearly right-wing. The acts \nbelow are instances of right-wing violence that are unequivocally committed \nby people who are openly hostile to liberalism. While this does not mean \nthese killers are Republicans, it is quite clear that they are \nRIGHT-WINGERS and that they have far more in common with Mr. Hedgecock, \nAlex Jones and the other gun-toting conspiracy nuts on the right than with \nany evils associated with the Democratic Party or liberalism. In addition, \nto the list below is the obvious case of Timothy McVeigh, who I have not \nincluded because his crime was not committed with firearms. It was however, \ncommitted by a right-winger and the carnage was on a massive scale.\nOctober 24, 2008\nTwo white supremacists, Daniel Cowart and Paul Schlesselman, are arrested \nin Tennessee for allegedly plotting to assassinate Barack Obama and murder \nmore than 100 black people. Officials say Schlesselman and Cowart, a \nprobationary member of the racist skinhead group Supreme White Alliance, \nplanned to kill 88 people, then behead another 14. (Both numbers are \nsignificant in white supremacist circles. H is the eighth letter of the \nalphabet, so double 8s stand for HH, or \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d The number 14 \nrepresents the \u201c14 Words,\u201d a popular racist saying.) The pair are indicted \non charges that include threatening a presidential candidate, possessing a \nsawed-off shotgun, taking firearms across state lines to commit crimes, \nplanning to rob a licensed gun dealer, damaging religious property, and \nusing a firearm during the commission of a crime. In 2010, Cowart is \nsentenced to 14 years and Schlesselman is sentenced to 10.\nDecember 9, 2008\nPolice responding to a shooting at a home in Belfast, Maine, find James G. \nCummings dead, allegedly killed by his wife after years of domestic abuse. \nThey also find a cache of radioactive materials, which Cummings was \napparently using to try to build a radioactive \"dirty bomb,\" along with \nliterature on how to build such a deadly explosive. Police also discover a \nmembership application filled out by Cummings for the neo-Nazi National \nSocialist Movement. Friends say that Cummings had a collection of Nazi \nmemorabilia. The authorities say Cummings was reportedly \"very upset\" by \nthe election of Barack Obama.\nDecember 16, 2008\nKody Ray Brittingham, a lance corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps, is \narrested with four others on attempted robbery charges. A search of his \nbarracks room at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina turns up white supremacist \nmaterials and a journal written by Brittingham containing plans to kill \nBarack Obama. Brittingham is indicted for threatening the president-elect \nof the United States. He is sentenced in 2010 to 100 months in prison.\nJanuary 21, 2009\nOn the day after Barack Obama is inaugurated as the nation's first black \npresident, Keith Luke of Brockton, Mass., is arrested after shooting three \nblack immigrants from Cape Verde, killing two of them, as part of a \nracially motivated killing spree. The two murders are apparently only part \nof Luke's plan to kill black, Latino and Jewish people. After being \ncaptured by police, he reportedly says he planned to go to an Orthodox \nsynagogue near his home that night and \"kill as many Jews as possible.\" \nPolice say Luke, a white man who apparently had no contact with white \nsupremacists but spent the previous six months reading racist websites, \ntold them he was \"fighting for a dying race.\" Luke also says he formed his \nracist views in large part after watching videos on Podblanc, a racist \nvideo-sharing website run by longtime white supremacist Craig Cobb. When he \nlater appears in court for a hearing, Luke, charged with murder, kidnapping \nand aggravated rape, has etched a swastika into his own forehead, \napparently using a jail razor. He is convicted of first-degree murder in \nMay 2013 and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\nApril 4, 2009\nThree Pittsburgh police officers \u2014 Paul Sciullo III, Stephen Mayhle and \nEric Kelly \u2014 are fatally shot and a fourth, Timothy McManaway, is wounded \nafter responding to a domestic dispute at the home of Richard Andrew \nPoplawski, who had posted his racist and anti-Semitic views on white \nsupremacist websites. In one post, Poplawski talks about wanting a white \nsupremacist tattoo. He also reportedly tells a friend that America is \ncontrolled by a cabal of Jews, that U.S. troops may soon be used against \nAmerican citizens, and that he fears a ban on guns is coming. Poplawski \nlater allegedly tells investigators that he fired extra bullets into the \nbodies of two of the officers \u201cjust to make sure they were dead\u201d and says \nhe \u201cthought I got that one, too\u201d when told that the fourth officer \nsurvived. More law enforcement officers are killed during the incident than \nin any other single act of violence by a domestic political extremist since \nthe 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Poplawski is convicted of three counts of \nfirst-degree murder in 2011 and sentenced to death.\nApril 25, 2009\nJoshua Cartwright, a Florida National Guardsman, allegedly shoots to death \ntwo Okaloosa County, Fla., sheriff's deputies \u2014 Burt Lopez and Warren \n\"Skip\" York \u2014 at a gun range as the officers attempt to arrest Cartwright \non domestic violence charges. After fleeing the scene, Cartwright is \nfatally shot during a gun battle with pursuing officers. Cartwright's wife \nlater tells investigators that her husband was \"severely disturbed\" that \nBarack Obama has been elected president. He also reportedly believed the \nU.S. government was conspiring against him. The sheriff tells reporters \nthat Cartwright had been interested in joining a militia group.\nMay 31, 2009\nScott Roeder, an anti-abortion extremist who was involved with the \nantigovernment \u201cfreemen\u201d movement in the 1990s, allegedly shoots to death \nKansas late-term abortion provider George Tiller as the doctor is serving \nas an usher in his Wichita church. Adherents of \u201cfreemen\u201d ideology claim \nthey are \u201csovereign citizens\u201d not subject to federal and other laws, and \noften form their own \u201ccommon law\u201d courts and issue their own license \nplates. It was one of those homemade plates that led Topeka police to stop \nRoeder in April 1996, when a search of his trunk revealed a pound of \ngunpowder, a 9-volt battery wired to a switch, blasting caps and \nammunition. A prosecutor in that case called Roeder a \u201csubstantial threat \nto public safety,\u201d citing Roeder\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the court\u2019s \nauthority. But his conviction in the 1996 case is ultimately overturned. In \nthe Tiller case, Roeder is convicted of first-degree murder in January 2010 \nand is sentenced to life in prison.\nJune 10, 2009\nEighty-eight-year-old James von Brunn, a longtime neo-Nazi, walks up to the \nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and shoots to death security guard Stephen \nJohns before he is himself shot and critically wounded by other officers. \nVon Brunn, who earlier served six years in connection with his 1981 attempt \nto kidnap the members of the Federal Reserve Board at the point of a \nsawed-off shotgun, has been active in the white supremacist movement for \nmore than four decades. In the early 1970s, he worked at the \nHolocaust-denying Noontide Press, and in subsequent decades, he comes to \nknow many of the key leaders of the radical right. A search of von Brunn\u2019s \ncar after the museum attack turns up a list of other apparent targets, \nincluding the White House, the Capitol, the National Cathedral and The \nWashington Post. A note allegedly left by von Brunn in his car reads: \u201cYou \nwant my weapons; this is how you\u2019ll get them \u2026 the Holocaust is a lie \u2026 \nObama was created by Jews. Obama does what his Jew owners tell him to do. \nJews captured America\u2019s money. Jews control the mass media.\u201d Von Brunn is \ncharged with murder but dies in 2010 while awaiting trial.\nJune 12, 2009\nShawna Forde \u2014 the executive director of Minutemen American Defense (MAD), \nan anti-immigrant vigilante group that conducts \u201ccitizen patrols\u201d on the \nArizona-Mexico border \u2014 is charged with two counts of first-degree murder \nfor her role in the slayings of a Latino man and his 9-year-old daughter in \nArivaca, Ariz. Forde orchestrated the May 30 home invasion because she \nbelieved the man was a narcotics trafficker and wanted to steal drugs and \ncash to fund her group. Authorities say the murders, including the killing \nof the child, were part of the plan. Also arrested and charged with murder \nare the alleged triggerman, MAD Operations Director Jason Eugene \u201cGunny\u201d \nBush, and Albert Robert Gaxiola, 42, a local member of MAD. Authorities say \nthat Bush had ties to the neo-Nazi Aryan Nations in Idaho, and that Forde \nhas spoken of recruiting its members. Forde is sentenced to death in \nFebruary 2011, and Bush is sentenced to death in April 2011. Gaxiola is \nsentenced to life in prison.\nJune 25, 2009\nLongtime white supremacist Dennis Mahon and his brother Daniel are indicted \nin Arizona in connection with a mail bomb sent in 2004 to a diversity \noffice in Scottsdale that injured three people. Mahon, formerly tied to the \nneo-Nazi White Aryan Resistance (WAR) group, allegedly left a phone message \nat the office saying that \"the White Aryan Resistance is growing in \nScottsdale. There's a few white people who are standing up.\" In a related \nraid, agents search the Indiana home of Tom Metzger, founder of WAR, but he \nis not arrested. On the same day, white supremacist Robert Joos is arrested \nin rural Missouri, apparently because phone records show that Dennis \nMahon's first call after the mail bombing was to Joos' cell phone. Joos is \ncharged with being a felon in possession of firearms and is sentenced in \nMay 2010 to 6\u00bd years in prison. Dennis Mahon is found guilty of three \nbombing charges in February 2012.

Wow! This is so revealing of the limited mind \nset that will ultimately destroy western culture and this country along \nwith it. 1.) I am not from a red state. In fact, I live in the largest city \nof one of the bluest states. 2.) My school credentials include The Sorbonne \nin Paris and two other universities 3.) You don't seem to have the \nslightest notion of what you're talking about when you blather on about \n\"fascists\" and lump people into simple two dimensional categories based on \nsome position statement they've made on such and such political issue that \ncauses an emotional reaction in you. First of all big guy, \"cultural \ndiversity\" exists nowhere in the world except in the minds of foppish \nwestern academics. It's a game that only works if all players agree on the \nrules. Try moving to China and telling your hosts you're not going to abide \nby the Chinese way of doing things and you will see how culturally diverse \nthey are. Each culture has a different Weltanschauung , a way of regarding \nthe universe if you will. As a nursing student I had to learn to work both \nwith and around cultural norms that differed radically from my own or else \nmy ability to care for them would have been severely compromised. My \nwestern European culture has aspects virtues shared by almost no other, and \nit's time you learned what they are 1.) a respect for the rights of the \nindividual quite apart from the demands of the society. 2.) Intellectual \nfreedom, even to question the most sacred precepts of the culture. 3.) \nrespect for the rights of women as human beings. 4.) Recognition of the \nhumanity of gay and lesbian people. 5.) the right to practice my own \nreligion or none at all without fear of persecution. 6.) flowering of a \nspirit of inquiry and intellectual curiosity. You have passion, but you \nneed to stop using words that you do not understand like \"fascist\" and of \ncourse the old stand by--\"racist\" YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING \nABOUT. As a western European, whose culture actually specialized in the \nabove virtues ( totally absent or much less prevalent in virtually all \nother human cultures) I confess to being a proud eurocentric. This has \nnothing to do with racism or sinister right wing tendencies. The biggest \nfascist danger that you face comes from the Islamic world not from the \nRepublican party.

I too share a profound \ndiscomfort with much that is associated with our culture's extreme right \nwing. However, the fact remains that our mainstream political \nestablishment, dominated by the frightfully  wacky multicultural left has \nthus far demonstrated an utter lack of awareness of the danger to our \ncivilization posed by militant Islam terrorist or not. I have lived and \ntraveled extensively in Europe. Thirty years ago there were many \nneighborhoods in Paris where I could not safely live because of my western \nchristian ethnic identity and my lifestyle. Levels of intolerant extremism \n(whether backed up by actual criminal violence or not) that in most \nchristian cultures are stigmatized and marginalized (You are a fine \nexample) are in most Islamic cultures just slightly to the right of center. \nFor years, most western countries have abandoned the idea of forcing \nimmigrants to assimilate to surrounding (western) norms (It would hurt \ntheir self esteem). The result is the proliferation of \"no go zones\" that \nsurround most large western European cities. In these places, the laws of \nthe host country are a suggestion. Sharia law determines whether a \nrebellious daughter will be thrown out of the house or turn up dead. Young \ngirls turn up in hospital emergency rooms with life threatening infections \ncaused by genitally mutilating operations performed at home or in \nunsanitary makeshift clinics. Meanwhile, in the public arena, journalists \nare killed for publishing comments deemed offensive by some Muslims. The \npolitical establishment responds to all this by passing laws against hate \nspeech. ( anything that any Muslim MIGHT find objectionable ) So you see, \nyour fears about OUR right wing are morally correct but woefully \ninappropriate to the realities our our current historical juncture. You do \nrepresent the best tradition of more than one civilization in your embrace \nof the philosophy of non-violence and cultural relativism. Nevertheless, \nthere comes a point where long term neglect of common sense intermediate \nstrategies of self preservation will produce an existential crisis of such \nmagnitude that the very people and tactics that you (rightly) despise. will \nbe taking the lead in our defense. (This is already happening in Europe, \nwhere normal tolerant people are voting for racist parties of the \nnationalist right because in one of history's greatest ironies, these \nparties are the only ones who (often in spite of themselves) are the ones \nupholding western values. I am sorry for being so long winded.

As long as there's \nsomeone else to blame....this administration succeeds at the destruction of \nthis country (albeit a smoke and mirrors strategy which works well on this \nnation of distracted citizens).\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13sdllxmyjpd3fxm04cdhhp2oumez4hejk": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcDkOzrRO6Qvrh2elF1KJ_w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s14Pj86DaIQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADM/ii60GX-h66A/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Eamonn Oriain", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-27T10:05:05.736Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCcDkOzrRO6Qvrh2elF1KJ_w"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99336042999999996, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2015-09-27T10:05:05.736Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109500200110177702171", "textDisplay": "Really enjoyed this, thanks for posting.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z124ur0jnqa2y12qo04ce3dbptrdjxcq5mw0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkOTGm8V8KU8Eu_gFLN4Zw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wlsjpLOYE4U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/puaUSSX02gA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Frank Stone", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-01T02:02:24.125Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCSkOTGm8V8KU8Eu_gFLN4Zw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.75271400000000011, "formal_score": 94, "updatedAt": "2014-10-01T02:02:24.125Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112124711650367541621", "textDisplay": "The background music is hypnotic , at times.

Powers as you rightfully said are \nresponsible for corrupting Socialism and Communism. But just because \nthey're corrupted. Does that necessarily mean that them countries are \nindeed not Socialist? Of course they are!\nOne cannot defend an ideology just because one right-winged policy stays is \nalso present. For it becomes consumed by that countries political system, \nin simple terms it's adopted as normal. So a country that's socialist, \nmight not even understand that it's infected with fascism. In that sense we \ncan treat it as a disease, which also makes us both wrong! For if we came \nto the conclusion that Fascism isn't \"winged\" whatsoever, then it explains \nwhy it's never been confronted in countries that you say are \"left winged\" \ndon't you think? How can a third world country with barely any outside \ninfluence possibly understand that it's wrong to discriminate and hate \nothers just because they're different etc?... But then again I'd ask you to \nlook up Socialism.\nMany experts are now understanding that Fascism although is a Right-Winged \nideology, is often and almost always found Left winged countries, even \nultra left countries! It's at ends with Libertarianism, Marxism and indeed \ntraditional Conservatism! Although Wiki can't be always trusted, it seems \nto be the case on many other descriptions online.

Firstly \nyou must understand the very meaning of Fascism, I'm surmising you're \ncapable of using Google, well Wiki's always got a good incite. Feel free... \nBe careful to read the small print. You'll find all the evidence needed to \nshow Fascism is more to do with Left Winged communistic ideas as it has to \ndo with Right winged ideas. This is a known fact throughout the world... \nThough dominated by the Right Wing. Fascism in it's extremist forms come \nfrom Poor Left winged parts of society. My point is Fascism springs from \nall walks of life, yet in my honest opinion... Fascism generally comes from \nSocialist/Communistic countries more so than the content rich \"right \nwinged\" populous. It would seem you Americans have a very different yet \nludicrous way of thinking when it comes to politics. Nonetheless I think \nit's wise you do some research on the term Fascism. Perhaps you could learn \na thing or too. But as for me, it would seem I've no chance of opening your \neyes as it were. So I bid you a very pleasant day...

Private property is any property that you have a say \nin controlling or manipulating. Personal property is anything you \npersonally use on a regular basis, like your cloths, the things in your \nhouse, your house, so on. Private property gives you a say in something, \neven if you don't use every day. This say cannot be enforced or respected \nwithout laws. This is true even if you hold a stock, since you have a say \nin proportion of the amount you own. If you are a business owner, or \nmajority stock holder, you have the end all word on what happens to that \nproperty. (it is generally in your advantage to gain more profits though, \nbecause if your business is stagnating, people who invest in you will try \nto pull out and sell.) The state enforces your right as the private \nproperty owner to gain profits on other people's labor because you own the \nthings they are laboring with. If you and only you were tasked with \ndefending a business you realize profits on, you would probably have a hard \ntime, especially if you have a large business far away from you. The COP's \njob is to protect that private property, and maintain social order. While \nthere are many cases of the state stealing land, that is only if you aren't \na major interest. If you are a large, profitable company, the state will \nprotect you more than it hurts you.\n\n\"Capitalism really protects the employees, since it gives them the power to \nbecome wealthier,\" Capitalism is directly pitted against employees. If \nanything, capitalism needs a state apparatus to even function. If there \nwasn't a state, people would realize that they generate more profit than \nyou are paying them for and demand the full fruits of their labor. Everyone \nwould be private, small scale producers. The only way you can convince \nsomeone to be an employee is if they are certain that having some of the \nfruits of their labor given to you will help them, unless they are ignorant \nto the fact that you are taking part of their value. Eventually people \nwould realize you are taking more than you are giving and demand something \nback, which is where the state comes in. private property in the means of \nproduction would be self defeating without someone to defend those \nproperties.\n\nyour conceptualization of socialism is false. Socialists want democratic \nownership of the means of production aka worker's control. the argument \ngoes that if you work the means of production, you deserve a say in how it \noperates. You are confusing socialism with the idea of a totalitarian \nstate. If a de facto royality were to own the means or production, and not \nthe workers themselves, it would not be socialism. The whole incentive \nargument is based on the idea of equal distribution of wealth, which is \noften misconceptualized by conservatives aswell. Some businesses do today \nrun on equal distribution, where the CEO and the workers equal divide up \nprofits, but that is not a core of socialism. The workers can vote to give \npeople with harder jobs more money if they agree that is the right thing to \ndo for everyone. As long as everyone has an equal say, it is democratically \nowned. Even in communism you wouldn't have people all equaling having all \nof the wealth, you would have \"from each according to his ability, to each \naccording to his need.\" meaning you produce as much as you can, and only \ntake as much as you need. so far communism has never existed. The USSR. \nChina, Cuba, they were all communist movements, but they were socialist \nstates. A lot of people think the USSR was fascistic or state capitalism, \nbut it was probably the most socialistic state so far. factories that were \ngoing under were invested into more so they could stay self sufficient. \nThis invested money was then given back to the government and the community \nsince in almost every case the businesses started producing excess profits. \nCollective democratic farming was largely successful, and factories were \nrun by labor unions which made decisions either through consensus decision \nmaking or elected managers. The idea of one omnipotent manager of all \nthings is not only silly, but empirically wrong. A lot of the short comings \nplaced on Stalin weren't even decisions he made. It was due to decisions \nmade by people who were elected by the workers, and even then, Stalin \nworked hard to correct those mistakes. In fact, Stalin made a lot of \nefforts to have the USSR run more democratically than it did under Lenin. \nEven in capitalism, you have to give in to the whim of your stock holders \nunless you have the money to keep your business running and profitable all \non your own.\n\n\"I think it's not that simple to just say that either can exist \nwith/without a state, I think it's not that simple to just say that either \ncan exist with/without a state, since socialism by definition requires a \nstate(to take property from people), while capitalism just requires at \nleast two persons who wish to trade.(to take property from people), while \ncapitalism just requires at least two persons who wish to trade.\" If you \nlook at the actual definition of socialism - Socialism is a social and \neconomic system characterised by social ownership of the means of \nproduction and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a \npolitical theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a \nsystem.\nSocialism, as seen here, does not require a state. Socialism can be \nachieved though a state, but if a state were to own the means of production \nit would not be socialism. If a small  minority control the state with no \nregard to the people, it is fascism. If the people democratically elect \npeople to make production decisions for them, or if they all vote on how \nthose things ought to be handled directly, it is socialism. Basically, if \nthe majority is excluded from decision making, it isn't socialism. In \ncapitalism, the minority make decisions on production... some people say \nsocialism=production for the social welfare above all else. while \ncapitalism=production for profits above all else, but like I said, thins \ncan get subjective and lead to very skewed views on political/economic \nsystems. so, for the most part both, capitalists and socialists can agree \non the definition of both I gave in my last comment."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqmaMC8p-FIi5AoOyovaqg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Matan Pulverman", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nhffislfsi1qxc04cj15i5wmrz5hx2hg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-02T08:34:57.956Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCVqmaMC8p-FIi5AoOyovaqg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.11952000000000002, "formal_score": 98, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-02T08:34:57.956Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p1FvdKw3WI8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAsI/FWbk6vw7MV4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107866266394122753358", "textDisplay": "+John Edwards Capitalism is the independent and willing exchange of \ngoods/services for goods/services.

I like to define capitalism as not \njust free trade, but a system where the means of production are privately \nowned and used to achieve profits. I feel libertarians too often associate \nthe state in general as \"socialism\" or \"communism\", but this definition of \ncapitalism can exist in a number of ways. Theoretically in \n\"anarcho\"-capitalism, in a mixed economy, or even in a planned economy, as \nlong as the means of production are being used to achieve profit at the \nexpense of other variables, even earlier china can be called capitalist. \nSome call it state capitalism, because the state still uses the means of \nproduction to achieve profit above all else. But I prefer to attach private \nproperty to capitalism since it makes the idea more tangible than just \nmaking money for money's sake, even though that is what it usually boils \ndown to. If there isn't some basic philosophy behind the system it ends up \nbecoming purely subjective, and that is never good for discussion. \nCapitalism vs. Socialism usually boils down to Boss vs. Worker control. \nCapitalists usually argue for a boss or bosses that directly control the \nproduction and distribution of goods. Socialists usually fight for Workers \ndemocratically taking this function over. But even then, capitalism and \nsocialism and be mistaken for one another. Some people say there is still \ncapitalism if the workers democratically control the means of production, \nbut in a way to benefit themselves or special interests above the \ncommunity.

They \neventually saw lower classes and common people as plastic, bendable to the \nwill of leaders and incapable of significant independent thought (massive \negoism...). This was one of the central ideas of nazi Germany, held by \nHitler himself. There were more progressive voices in Nazi Germany, but it \nwas limited to mildly liberal nit-picking. They sounded much like liberals \nin the US.

However, after a while, he \nbegan a program of re-privatization (some say the word comes from hitler \nand his policies, but I doubt it) where he took once nationalized \nindustries and cut the government shares, essecially giving them to private \nbusinessmen. He handed over quite a lot of business and kicked many still \nstruggling Germans off of social aid programs. Germany eventually realized \ngreater capital gains in the up turn of the world economy than most western \ncountries. Even the US.\n\nHitler is quoted all over the board. He said he supported \"true\" \nsocialists, but since he basically went against the entire current of \nsocialist thought at the time, everyone saw it as propaganda to win over \nthe swelled working class. He even later said that he doesn't support \nsocialists, and that he never did and that the only pace for them was in \novens. Calling Hitler a socialist is like calling Kim Jong Un a \ndemocratically elected president."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqmaMC8p-FIi5AoOyovaqg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Matan Pulverman", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nhffislfsi1qxc04cj15i5wmrz5hx2hg", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-31T19:48:25.089Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCVqmaMC8p-FIi5AoOyovaqg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.43213799999999997, "formal_score": 56, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-31T19:48:25.089Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p1FvdKw3WI8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAsI/FWbk6vw7MV4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107866266394122753358", "textDisplay": "How were the National Socialists right wing?"}}]}, "z12chpvhpvzmfbdt222jxxrxmu3lcxghz04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 4, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9xIm2FSXKsmuKD-uACSOqQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Mhp-Zsp-0ic/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACw/U1evxCsThAc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.1764705882352942, "authorDisplayName": "azmhyr", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-06-19T00:46:56.652Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9xIm2FSXKsmuKD-uACSOqQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.61614199999999997, "formal_score": 36, "updatedAt": "2015-06-19T00:46:56.652Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/106130909974733537001", "textDisplay": "\"Prominent Reich wingers\": Ayn Rand\nWow.

Schertz, a former member of the North Georgia White Knights of \nthe Ku Klux Klan, is indicted in Chattanooga, Tenn., on federal weapons \ncharges for allegedly making seven pipe bombs and selling them to an \nundercover informant with the idea that they would be used to murder \nMexican and Haitian immigrant workers. The informant says Schertz \ndemonstrated how to attach the pipe bombs to cars, then sold him bombs that \nSchertz expected to be used against a group of Haitians and, separately, \nMexican workers on a bus headed to work in Florida. Schertz eventually \npleads guilty to six charges \u2014 including teaching how to make an explosive \ndevice; making, possessing and transferring destructive devices; and \npossessing a pistol with armor-piercing bullets \u2014 and is sentenced to 14 \nyears in prison. He is to be released in 2017.\nMarch 19, 2006\nU.S. Treasury agents in Utah arrest David J. D'Addabbo for allegedly \nthreatening Internal Revenue Service employees with \"death by firing squad\" \nif they continued to try to collect taxes from him and his wife. D'Addabbo, \nwho was reportedly carrying a Glock pistol, 40 rounds of ammunition and a \nswitchblade knife when he was seized leaving a church service, allegedly \nwrote to the U.S. Tax Court that anyone attempting to collect taxes would \nbe tried by a \"jury of common people. You then could be found guilty of \ntreason and immediately taken to a firing squad.\" In August D'Addabbo \npleads guilty to one charge of threatening a government agent in exchange \nfor the dismissal of three other charges of threatening IRS agents. He is \nsentenced to time served and released the same year as his arrest.\nApril 26, 2007\nFive members of the Alabama Free Militia are arrested in north Alabama in a \nraid by federal and state law enforcement officers that uncovers a cache of \n130 homemade hand grenades, an improvised grenade launcher, a Sten Mark \nsubmachine gun, a silencer, 2,500 rounds of ammunition and almost 100 \nmarijuana plants. Raymond Kirk Dillard, the founder and \u201ccommander\u201d of the \ngroup, pleads guilty to criminal conspiracy, illegally making and \npossessing destructive devices and being a felon in possession of a \nfirearm. Other members of the group \u2014 Bonnell \u201cBuster\u201d Hughes, James Ray \nMcElroy, Adam Lynn Cunningham and Randall Garrett Cole\u2014 also plead guilty \nto related charges. Although Dillard, who complained about the collapse of \nthe American economy, terrorist attacks and Mexicans taking over the \ncountry, reportedly told his troops to open fire on federal agents if ever \nconfronted, no shots are fired during the April raid, and the \u201ccommander\u201d \neven points out booby-trap tripwires on his property to investigators. \nDillard draws the harshest sentence, and is released in May 2012. Cole is \nreleased in December 2009; Cunningham in June 2009; Hughes in January 2009; \nand McElroy in August 2010.\nJune 8, 2008\nSix people, most of them tied to the militia movement, are arrested in \nrural north-central Pennsylvania after officials find stockpiles of assault \nrifles, improvised explosives and homemade weapons, at least some of them \napparently intended for use in terrorist attacks on U.S. officials. Agents \nfind 16 homemade bombs during a search of the residence of Pennsylvania \nCitizens Militia recruiter Bradley T. Kahle, who allegedly tells \nauthorities that he intended to shoot black people from a rooftop in \nPittsburgh and also predicts civil war if either Barack Obama or Hillary \nClinton is elected president. A raid on the property of Morgan Jones \nresults in the seizure of 73 weapons, including a homemade flame thrower, a \nmachine that supposedly shot bolts of electricity, and an improvised \ncannon. Also arrested and charged with weapons violations are Marvin E. \nHall, his girlfriend Melissa Huet and Perry Landis, who allegedly tells \nundercover agents he wanted to kill Gov. Ed Rendell. Landis is sentenced in \n2009 to time served plus two years of supervised release. Hall is sentenced \nin January 2010 to time served with three years of probation. Huet spends \nyears trying to get the charges against her \u2013 helping a convicted felon \npossess a firearm \u2013 dismissed. In July 2013, federal prosecutors drop gun \ncharges against her.\nAugust 24, 2008\nWhite supremacists Shawn Robert Adolf, Tharin Robert Gartrell and Nathan D. \nJohnson are arrested in Denver during the Democratic National Convention on \nweapons charges and for possession of amphetamines. Although police say \nthey talked about assassinating presidential candidate Barack Obama, they \nare not charged in connection with that threat because officials see their \ntalk as drug-fueled boasting. Police report the three had high-powered, \nscoped rifles, wigs, camouflage clothing and a bulletproof vest, along with \nthe crystal methamphetamine. Gartrell is released from prison in June 2009, \nwhile Johnson is released in 2010. Adolf, who was already wanted on other \ncharges, draws a longer sentence and is released in April 2012.\nOctober 24, 2008\nTwo white supremacists, Daniel Cowart and Paul Schlesselman, are arrested \nin Tennessee for allegedly plotting to assassinate Barack Obama and murder \nmore than 100 black people. Officials say Schlesselman and Cowart, a \nprobationary member of the racist skinhead group Supreme White Alliance, \nplanned to kill 88 people, then behead another 14. (Both numbers are \nsignificant in white supremacist circles. H is the eighth letter of the \nalphabet, so double 8s stand for HH, or \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d The number 14 \nrepresents the \u201c14 Words,\u201d a popular racist saying.) The pair are indicted \non charges that include threatening a presidential candidate, possessing a \nsawed-off shotgun, taking firearms across state lines to commit crimes, \nplanning to rob a licensed gun dealer, damaging religious property, and \nusing a firearm during the commission of a crime. In 2010, Cowart is \nsentenced to 14 years and Schlesselman is sentenced to 10.\nDecember 9, 2008\nPolice responding to a shooting at a home in Belfast, Maine, find James G. \nCummings dead, allegedly killed by his wife after years of domestic abuse. \nThey also find a cache of radioactive materials, which Cummings was \napparently using to try to build a radioactive \"dirty bomb,\" along with \nliterature on how to build such a deadly explosive. Police also discover a \nmembership application filled out by Cummings for the neo-Nazi National \nSocialist Movement. Friends say that Cummings had a collection of Nazi \nmemorabilia. The authorities say Cummings was reportedly \"very upset\" by \nthe election of Barack Obama.\nDecember 16, 2008\nKody Ray Brittingham, a lance corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps, is \narrested with four others on attempted robbery charges. A search of his \nbarracks room at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina turns up white supremacist \nmaterials and a journal written by Brittingham containing plans to kill \nBarack Obama. Brittingham is indicted for threatening the president-elect \nof the United States. He is sentenced in 2010 to 100 months in prison.\nJanuary 21, 2009\nOn the day after Barack Obama is inaugurated as the nation's first black \npresident, Keith Luke of Brockton, Mass., is arrested after shooting three \nblack immigrants from Cape Verde, killing two of them, as part of a \nracially motivated killing spree. The two murders are apparently only part \nof Luke's plan to kill black, Latino and Jewish people. After being \ncaptured by police, he reportedly says he planned to go to an Orthodox \nsynagogue near his home that night and \"kill as many Jews as possible.\" \nPolice say Luke, a white man who apparently had no contact with white \nsupremacists but spent the previous six months reading racist websites, \ntold them he was \"fighting for a dying race.\" Luke also says he formed his \nracist views in large part after watching videos on Podblanc, a racist \nvideo-sharing website run by longtime white supremacist Craig Cobb. When he \nlater appears in court for a hearing, Luke, charged with murder, kidnapping \nand aggravated rape, has etched a swastika into his own forehead, \napparently using a jail razor. He is convicted of first-degree murder in \nMay 2013 and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\nApril 4, 2009\nThree Pittsburgh police officers \u2014 Paul Sciullo III, Stephen Mayhle and \nEric Kelly \u2014 are fatally shot and a fourth, Timothy McManaway, is wounded \nafter responding to a domestic dispute at the home of Richard Andrew \nPoplawski, who had posted his racist and anti-Semitic views on white \nsupremacist websites. In one post, Poplawski talks about wanting a white \nsupremacist tattoo. He also reportedly tells a friend that America is \ncontrolled by a cabal of Jews, that U.S. troops may soon be used against \nAmerican citizens, and that he fears a ban on guns is coming. Poplawski \nlater allegedly tells investigators that he fired extra bullets into the \nbodies of two of the officers \u201cjust to make sure they were dead\u201d and says \nhe \u201cthought I got that one, too\u201d when told that the fourth officer \nsurvived. More law enforcement officers are killed during the incident than \nin any other single act of violence by a domestic political extremist since \nthe 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Poplawski is convicted of three counts of \nfirst-degree murder in 2011 and sentenced to death.\nApril 25, 2009\nJoshua Cartwright, a Florida National Guardsman, allegedly shoots to death \ntwo Okaloosa County, Fla., sheriff's deputies \u2014 Burt Lopez and Warren \n\"Skip\" York \u2014 at a gun range as the officers attempt to arrest Cartwright \non domestic violence charges. After fleeing the scene, Cartwright is \nfatally shot during a gun battle with pursuing officers. Cartwright's wife \nlater tells investigators that her husband was \"severely disturbed\" that \nBarack Obama has been elected president. He also reportedly believed the \nU.S. government was conspiring against him. The sheriff tells reporters \nthat Cartwright had been interested in joining a militia group.\nMay 31, 2009\nScott Roeder, an anti-abortion extremist who was involved with the \nantigovernment \u201cfreemen\u201d movement in the 1990s, allegedly shoots to death \nKansas late-term abortion provider George Tiller as the doctor is serving \nas an usher in his Wichita church. Adherents of \u201cfreemen\u201d ideology claim \nthey are \u201csovereign citizens\u201d not subject to federal and other laws, and \noften form their own \u201ccommon law\u201d courts and issue their own license \nplates. It was one of those homemade plates that led Topeka police to stop \nRoeder in April 1996, when a search of his trunk revealed a pound of \ngunpowder, a 9-volt battery wired to a switch, blasting caps and \nammunition. A prosecutor in that case called Roeder a \u201csubstantial threat \nto public safety,\u201d citing Roeder\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the court\u2019s \nauthority. But his conviction in the 1996 case is ultimately overturned. In \nthe Tiller case, Roeder is convicted of first-degree murder in January 2010 \nand is sentenced to life in prison.\nJune 10, 2009\nEighty-eight-year-old James von Brunn, a longtime neo-Nazi, walks up to the \nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and shoots to death security guard Stephen \nJohns before he is himself shot and critically wounded by other officers. \nVon Brunn, who earlier served six years in connection with his 1981 attempt \nto kidnap the members of the Federal Reserve Board at the point of a \nsawed-off shotgun, has been active in the white supremacist movement for \nmore than four decades. In the early 1970s, he worked at the \nHolocaust-denying Noontide Press, and in subsequent decades, he comes to \nknow many of the key leaders of the radical right. A search of von Brunn\u2019s \ncar after the museum attack turns up a list of other apparent targets, \nincluding the White House, the Capitol, the National Cathedral and The \nWashington Post. A note allegedly left by von Brunn in his car reads: \u201cYou \nwant my weapons; this is how you\u2019ll get them \u2026 the Holocaust is a lie \u2026 \nObama was created by Jews. Obama does what his Jew owners tell him to do. \nJews captured America\u2019s money. Jews control the mass media.\u201d Von Brunn is \ncharged with murder but dies in 2010 while awaiting trial.\nJune 12, 2009\nShawna Forde \u2014 the executive director of Minutemen American Defense (MAD), \nan anti-immigrant vigilante group that conducts \u201ccitizen patrols\u201d on the \nArizona-Mexico border \u2014 is charged with two counts of first-degree murder \nfor her role in the slayings of a Latino man and his 9-year-old daughter in \nArivaca, Ariz. Forde orchestrated the May 30 home invasion because she \nbelieved the man was a narcotics trafficker and wanted to steal drugs and \ncash to fund her group. Authorities say the murders, including the killing \nof the child, were part of the plan. Also arrested and charged with murder \nare the alleged triggerman, MAD Operations Director Jason Eugene \u201cGunny\u201d \nBush, and Albert Robert Gaxiola, 42, a local member of MAD. Authorities say \nthat Bush had ties to the neo-Nazi Aryan Nations in Idaho, and that Forde \nhas spoken of recruiting its members. Forde is sentenced to death in \nFebruary 2011, and Bush is sentenced to death in April 2011. Gaxiola is \nsentenced to life in prison.\nJune 25, 2009\nLongtime white supremacist Dennis Mahon and his brother Daniel are indicted \nin Arizona in connection with a mail bomb sent in 2004 to a diversity \noffice in Scottsdale that injured three people. Mahon, formerly tied to the \nneo-Nazi White Aryan Resistance (WAR) group, allegedly left a phone message \nat the office saying that \"the White Aryan Resistance is growing in \nScottsdale. There's a few white people who are standing up.\" In a related \nraid, agents search the Indiana home of Tom Metzger, founder of WAR, but he \nis not arrested. On the same day, white supremacist Robert Joos is arrested \nin rural Missouri, apparently because phone records show that Dennis \nMahon's first call after the mail bombing was to Joos' cell phone. Joos is \ncharged with being a felon in possession of firearms and is sentenced in \nMay 2010 to 6\u00bd years in prison. Dennis Mahon is found guilty of three \nbombing charges in February 2012. He is sentenced to 40 years in prison. \nDaniel Mahon is acquitted of the one charge against him.\nOct. 28, 2009\nLuqman Ameen Abdullah, identified by authorities as a member of a black \nMuslim group hoping to create an Islamic state within U.S. borders, is shot \ndead at a warehouse in Dearborn, Mich., after he fires at FBI agents trying \nto arrest him on conspiracy and weapons charges.

He is accused of giving one explosive device to an undercover \nagent, and is also named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a plot with \ncolleagues in the Idaho Mountain Boys militia to murder a federal judge and \na police officer, and to break a friend out of jail. A deadbeat dad, \nRaugust is also accused of helping plant land mines on property belonging \nto a friend whose land was seized by authorities over unpaid taxes.

Raugust was released in early 2008.\nJanuary 8, 2003\nFederal agents arrest Matt Hale, the national leader of the neo-Nazi World \nChurch of the Creator (WCOTC), as he reports to a Chicago courthouse in an \nongoing copyright case over the name of his group. Hale is charged with \nsoliciting the murder of the federal judge in the case, Joan Humphrey \nLefkow, who he has publicly vilified as someone bent on the destruction of \nhis group. (Although Lefkow originally ruled in WCOTC's favor, an appeals \ncourt found that the complaint brought by an identically named church in \nOregon was legally justified, and Lefkow reversed herself accordingly.) In \nguarded language captured on tape recordings, Hale is heard agreeing that \nhis security chief, an FBI informant, should kill Lefkow. Hale is found \nguilty and sentenced to serve 40 years in federal prison; he is not \nexpected to be released until 2037.\nJanuary 18, 2003\nJames D. Brailey, a convicted felon who once was selected as \"governor\" of \nthe state of Washington by the antigovernment Washington Jural Society, is \narrested after a raid on his home turns up a machine gun, an assault rifle \nand several handguns. One informant tells the FBI that Brailey was plotting \nto assassinate Gov. Gary Locke, both because Locke was the state's real \ngovernor and because he was Chinese-American. A second informant says that \nBrailey actually went on a \"dry run\" to Olympia, carrying several guns into \nthe state Capitol building to test security. Eventually, Brailey pleads \nguilty to weapons charges and is sentenced to serve 15 months in prison. He \nis released in 2004.\nFebruary 13, 2003\nFederal agents in Pennsylvania arrest David Wayne Hull, imperial wizard of \nthe White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and an adherent of the anti-Semitic \nChristian Identity theology, alleging that Hull arranged to buy hand \ngrenades to blow up abortion clinics. The FBI says Hull also illegally \ninstructed followers on how to build pipe bombs. Hull, who published a \nnewsletter in which he urged readers to write Oklahoma City bomber Tim \nMcVeigh \"to tell this great man goodbye,\" is found guilty of weapons \nviolations and sentenced to 12 years in federal prison. He is released in \nJuly 2012.\nApril 3, 2003\nFederal agents arrest antigovernment extremist David Roland Hinkson in \nIdaho and charge him with trying to hire an assassin on two occasions in \n2002 and 2003 to murder a federal judge, a prosecutor and an IRS agent \ninvolved in a tax case against him. Hinkson, a businessman who earned \nmillions of dollars from his Water Oz dietary supplement company but \nrefused to pay almost $1 million in federal taxes, is convicted in 2004 of \n26 counts related to the tax case. In early 2005, a federal jury finds him \nguilty in the assassination plot as well. He is not expected to be released \nuntil 2040.\nApril 10, 2003\nThe FBI raids the Noonday, Texas, home of William Krar and storage \nfacilities that Krar rented in the area, discovering an arsenal that \nincludes more than 500,000 rounds of ammunition, 65 pipe bombs and \nremote-control briefcase bombs, and almost two pounds of deadly sodium \ncyanide. Also found are components to convert the cyanide into a bomb \ncapable of killing thousands, along with white supremacist and \nantigovernment material. Investigators soon learn Krar was stopped earlier \nin 2003 by police in Tennessee, who found several weapons and coded \ndocuments in his car that seemed to detail a plot. But Krar refuses to \ncooperate, and details of that alleged plan are never learned. He pleads \nguilty to possession of a chemical weapon and is sentenced to more than 11 \nyears in prison, where he dies.\nOctober 10, 2003\nPolice arrest Norman Somerville after finding a huge weapons cache on his \nproperty in northern Michigan that includes six machine guns, a powerful \nanti-aircraft gun, thousands of rounds of ammunition, hundreds of pounds of \ngunpowder, and an underground bunker. They also find two vehicles \nSomerville calls his \u201cwar wagons,\u201d and on which prosecutors later say he \nplanned to mount machine guns as part of a plan to stage an auto accident \nand then massacre arriving police. Officials describe Somerville as an \nantigovernment extremist enraged over the death of Scott Woodring, a \nMichigan Militia member killed by police a week after Woodring shot and \nkilled a state trooper during a standoff.

Danny Wilson and Constable Donnie Ouzts are \nshot to death by antigovernment \u201cPatriot\u201d Steven Bixby at the Abbeville \nhome of his parents, Arthur and Rita Bixby. Wilson, and later Ouzts, had \ngone to the home after state workers who were surveying for a road-widening \nproject that would have taken a few inches of the Bixbys\u2019 front lawn \ncomplained that they were threatened by the family. After a day-long \nshootout, Steven and Arthur are arrested. Steven is charged with murder and \ncriminal conspiracy, and his father is eventually sent to a mental \ninstitution. Rita, who was not in the house, is arrested later and charged \nas an accessory. Steven is sentenced to death in 2007 and remains on Death \nRow; his father is never tried and dies in the mental institution in 2011; \nand Rita is sentenced to life in 2007 and dies in prison four years later, \nsix days after her husband.\nApril 1, 2004\nNeo-Nazi Skinhead Sean Gillespie videotapes himself as he firebombs Temple \nB'nai Israel, an Oklahoma City synagogue, as part of a film he is preparing \nto inspire other racists to violent revolution. In it, Gillespie boasts \nthat instead of merely pronouncing the white-supremacist \"14 Words\" slogan \n(\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White \nchildren\"), he will carry out 14 violent attacks. A former member of the \nneo-Nazi Aryan Nations, Gillespie is found guilty of the attack and later \nsentenced to 39 years in federal prison, with an expected release date of \n2038.\nMay 24, 2004\nDuring the attempted robbery of a Tulsa bank by Wade and Christopher Lay, a \nfather-son pair of antigovernment extremists, security guard Kenneth \nAnderson is shot to death. Both robbers are wounded, and are arrested a \nshort time after fleeing the bank. At trial, Wade Lay testifies that he and \nhis son acted \u201cfor the good of the American people\u201d and in an effort to \n\u201cpreserve liberty.\u201d Other evidence shows the pair hoped to get money to pay \nfor weapons that they intended to use to kill Texas officials who they \nbelieved were responsible for the deadly 1993 standoff between the \nauthorities and religious cultists in Waco. In the end, Wade Lay is \nsentenced to death for first-degree murder, while his son is sentenced to \nlife without parole.\nOctober 13, 2004\nIvan Duane Braden, a former National Guardsman discharged from an \nIraq-bound unit after superiors noted signs of instability, is arrested \nafter checking into a mental health facility and telling counselors about \nplans to blow up a synagogue and a National Guard armory in Tennessee. The \nFBI reports that Braden told agents that he planned to go to a synagogue \nwearing a trench coat stuffed with explosives and get himself \"as close to \nchildren and the rabbi as possible,\" a plan Braden also outlined in notes \nfound in his home. In addition, he intended to take and kill hostages at \nthe Lenoir City Armory, before blowing the armory up. Eventually, Braden, \nwho also possessed neo-Nazi literature and reportedly hated blacks and Jews \nfrom an early age, pleads guilty to conspiring to blow up the armory. He is \nsentenced to prison, where his release is expected in 2017.\nOctober 25, 2004\nFBI agents in Tennessee arrest farmhand Demetrius \"Van\" Crocker after he \ntried to purchase ingredients for deadly sarin nerve gas and C-4 plastic \nexplosives from an undercover agent. The FBI reports that Crocker, who \nlocal officials say was involved in a white supremacist group in the 1980s, \ntells the agent that he admires Hitler and hates Jews and the government. \nHe also says \"it would be a good thing if somebody could detonate some sort \nof weapon of mass destruction on Washington, D.C.\" Crocker is convicted of \ntrying to get explosives to destroy a building and imprisoned until an \nexpected release in 2030.\nMay 20, 2005\nOfficials in New Jersey arrest two men they say asked a police informant to \nbuild them a bomb. Craig Orler, who has a history of burglary arrests, and \nGabriel Carafa, said to be a leader of the neo-Nazi World Church of the \nCreator and a member of a racist skinhead group called The Hated, are \ncharged with illegally selling 11 guns to police informants. Carafa gave \none informant 60 pounds of urea to use in building him a bomb, but never \nsaid what the bomb was for. Police say they moved in before the alleged \nbombing plot developed further because they were concerned about the pair's \nactivities. They taped Orler saying in a phone call that he was seeking \npeople in Europe to help him go underground. Orler is sentenced to more \nthan 10 years in prison, while Carafa draws seven."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTr5-Wm-Kp19zkW_NmUX3BA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "justvergel", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mjhjrwvyffl4jr04cgn1aklmevnmaeuk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-12T23:21:46.790Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCTr5-Wm-Kp19zkW_NmUX3BA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.86991440000000009, "formal_score": 26, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-05-12T23:21:46.790Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110843802978993715302", "textDisplay": "The \"terrorist\" scam isn't working anymore give it up, haha"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqNWJOeBOBSF1pm9tjGnKhg", "inappropriate_score": 4.7619047619047619, "authorDisplayName": "Reich-Wing Watch", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13mjhjrwvyffl4jr04cgn1aklmevnmaeuk0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-12T22:28:03.199Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqNWJOeBOBSF1pm9tjGnKhg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.90894969999999997, "formal_score": 14, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-05-12T22:28:03.199Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eQNr85s2pgo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAArc/fXlGhHIdPvQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112592753639445040055", "textDisplay": "The victims families seem pretty convinced, you heartless pro-terrorist \ndouche."}}]}, "z12mznbbcvqws3ask22sf1ayytbsgzihu04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuxN5J7EABT48SJLUmc0noQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "merc anthony", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-05-19T16:52:48.082Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCuxN5J7EABT48SJLUmc0noQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99040247999999997, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-05-19T16:52:48.082Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100914891183160750161", "textDisplay": "poplawski isnt  that  name  polish  hahaha\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13hjtewmqejjbf5n04cdreovmmjevabp0w": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyDmeRLW_JRm850WAC3_0dw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Roman Darius", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-08-20T10:17:19.924Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCyDmeRLW_JRm850WAC3_0dw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.17726200000000003, "formal_score": 66, "updatedAt": "2015-08-20T10:17:19.924Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112322400821989223384", "textDisplay": "Only Black Lives Matter liberalism.\n1.

"+Daniel Goodwin Of course they can. In order for this to happen, the \nConstitution must be restored(*at least in the USA; the solution would \nobviously be at least varied in other places*).\n\nRestoration of the Constitution for the sake of providing for everyone \nworks very simply, and in the following ways:\n\nThe Constitution outlines that there will be no property tax.\n\nThe elite and the politicians will argue that the elite will use this to \nescape taxes, while they already escape taxes.\n\nThe burden of property taxes in reality is that poor people can never truly \nown a home. The most basic necessity for stability in a person's life is \ntheir home, and they are constantly indebted to the federal government for \nsimply having a roof over their head.\n\nThe property tax is *in practice* a declaration that the government owns \nabsolutely everything, and to have anything, you must pay rent for it.\n\n*To begin talking about meeting everyone's needs, we must make some caveats \nfirst, and one of them is to accept that the needs of everyone except for \nthe poor are already met, and therefore the poor are the only ones relevant \nto the conversation.*\n\nWith the property tax abolished, it becomes possible for someone who makes \nonly a few tens of thousands of USD a year to pay off a fairly nice home in \nonly a few years if they have a spouse, and then *completely disregard the \nhome as an expense*.\n\nWith the burden of the property tax removed, it becomes completely feasible \nto do things like fund your childrens' education, so your kids never have \nto go into debt, or abstain from schooling simply because the family can't \nafford it.\n\nIt becomes feasible to invest in a company, start a business, stick solar \npanels on your roof so you can have even more surplus wealth in the long \nrun, etc. etc.\n\nNeeds being met depends *entirely* on \"surplus\" wealth.\n\nWith capitalism restored, and by capitalism I do mean free markets, things \nbecome *far* cheaper.\n\nFor example: one of the biggest failures of meeting people's needs is \nhealth care. The reason we even have a \"health care crisis\" is *not* \nbecause of greedy rich people who don't want to pay for everyone else's \nhealthcare, it's because of greedy rich people who want to see doctors \ncontinue to be the richest people most know, even though the goal of \nbecoming a doctor is extremely popular.\n\nThe reason doctors are expensive is because there's so few of them.\n\nThe reason there's so few of them is because the AMA has a chokehold of how \nmany are produced.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of capitalism. Under capitalism, there would be \nno government organization controlling the supply of a justifiable good or \nservice.\n\nThe reason treating yourself is so expensive is because even if you know \nwhat's wrong with you(*for example: a recurring fungus on your toes*), the \nAMA and FDA have made it impossible to get ahold of the drugs you already \nknow you need without spending money on seeing a doctor for 5 minutes.\n\nThe name of the game is surplus wealth, and surplus wealth can only mean \nanything if there is efficiency. Efficiency can only matter if the natural \norder of supply and demand can be allowed to produce the goods and services \nthat people want/need.\n\nIt's already established that a surplus of goods/services will arise if \nthere is no government control over them, and that this will result in \ncheaper goods/services.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe AMA doesn't control how many lawyers there are, and as a result, in \nplaces like Las Vegas, there's *ENTIRE DISTRICTS* of tiny buildings \ndedicated to ambulance-chasing, speed ticket-arguing, DUI-advocating, cheap \nas dirt attorneys, even though attorneys are historically outrageously \nexpensive."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkkrHWklQ4r3ZPD52CnLFDQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "DJ Programer", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13fcffqxoukg51zh04ccpzyqkyrx53pvi4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-18T16:40:17.787Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkkrHWklQ4r3ZPD52CnLFDQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.014383999999999952, "formal_score": 2, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-18T16:40:17.787Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KUapoKSchyE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADk/Oar8piwMDW0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117731370524164537733", "textDisplay": "+Mart Pulverman\nSo the question needs to be asked,\"Can everyone's needs be met?\"\nIf so, how?\n\nI would like to add that you make a good point in a general sense and I \nhave to admit that in hindsight everyone's needs can be met, it would just \nbe difficult.(I guess we just haven't gotten that far yet as a nation)"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqmaMC8p-FIi5AoOyovaqg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Matan Pulverman", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13fcffqxoukg51zh04ccpzyqkyrx53pvi4", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-18T04:36:43.108Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCVqmaMC8p-FIi5AoOyovaqg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.12949000000000005, "formal_score": 96, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-11-18T04:36:43.108Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p1FvdKw3WI8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAsI/FWbk6vw7MV4/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107866266394122753358", "textDisplay": "+Daniel Goodwin False.

Somehow, I doubt it.\n\nLike I said, (and I am saying this with your best interest in mind) STOP \nposting, and START reading.\n\nBecause the problem is that you do not know that you know next to nothing \nabout the political history of this country, and of its political party \nsystems.\n\nIf you are not a reader, then start with Ken Burn's documentary (one of the \nbest documentaries ever made -- and certainly the best AMERICAN documentary \never made) on the Civil War. If you want to understand America, you MUST \nunderstand that war, because it is still a powerful influence on our \nnation's politics today.\n\nThen I would check out PBS' excellent series of documentaries on the \nPresidents, which gives detailed accounts of almost all the modern \nPresidents from FDR to Clinton. (There is also an excellent documentary out \nthere about Herbert Hoover -- you will be surprised about what he was most \nfamous for BEFORE he became President).\n\nI don't think there is one about Bush 43 yet, because it is too soon after \nhis Presidency to get some historical perspective. And Obama is still in \noffice.\n\nYou don't have to trust me as a historical source -- I am merely repeating \nwhat I have learned over the course of my lifetime.\n\nI would also encourage you to read a history of the US which runs from 1945 \nto the present. Unfortunately, too many high school levels never even reach \nthis period in US history.\n\nAt the end of it all, I would not expect for us to be in total agreement, \nbut I have had very fruitful discussions (civil ones as well) with people \nthat I disagree with. I see that as a learning opportunity, and I hope I \nkeep an open mind.\n\nBut simply repeating ad hominem nonsense will go nowhere.

Read the history \nof our political party system.\n\nThat would be my advice to anyone who thinks that one party has always been \nthe liberal one and the other has always been the conservative one.\n\nIt is also important to remember that our Founders were more than a little \nnaive to believe they could create a political system which would not have \npolitical parties in it.\n\nThat idea was disproved during Washington's Administration, as the first \ntwo political parties coalesced around Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas \nJefferson, who both served in Washington's Cabinet.\n\nAs long as the two parties are able to compromise with each other, the \ngovernment would be able to function. This system of compromise (which is \nactually one of our greatest strengths as Americans) has really only failed \ntwice.\n\nThe first time the failure was not one of partisanship, but sectionalism, \nwith slavery as the wedge. It split both the Whigs (which resulted in the \nend of that party) and the Democratic Party (who ran two candidates in \n1860, one northern, and one southern).\n\nIt took a war to resolve that crisis.\n\nAnd it is possible that we are experiencing another failure now, as the \nRepublicans seem unable to compromise any more. I say this is the case with \nthe GOP, because there is a purge that is going on within the party, where \nANY GOP elected official is threatened with being \"primaried\" if they \ncompromise with the Democrats.\n\nIt's way too soon to figure out how this will resolve itself. It may mean \nthe end of the GOP, with another party arising to replace it, but no one \ncan say for certain what will happen.\n\nIn the long run, however, things look dire for the Republicans, whose base \nis now almost exclusively elderly white people. That generation is going to \nget smaller and smaller with each cycle, as that generation passes away.\n\nThe other trend is the changing demographics of the nation. We are becoming \nmore and more pluralistic with various ethnic groups and more diverse \nreligious communities.\n\nAnd the Republican Party seems to be doing everything it can to repel them. \nJust go back and look at the last two national Party Conventions. The \nRepublican delegates were a sea of older, white faces. Very few minorities \nwere present, and those that were, were placed in prominent places where \nthey were sure to be seen by the television cameras.\n\nAnd then there was the Democratic Convention, which was far more \nrepresentative of the nation as a whole.\n\nThe key state will soon be Texas, because once that state becomes purple, \nthen there will be no possible way for the Republicans to win the White \nHouse. At least not with the current Electoral College System.\n\nIt has already happened with California."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDkrQ_S3djorKmBl3TIF-Ag", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Alex Jones did 9/11", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12nef5gevfuvvhb104cdvfinovqf5hr2ro0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-29T23:10:33.108Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCDkrQ_S3djorKmBl3TIF-Ag"}, "sentiment_score": -0.8781698, "formal_score": 23, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-29T23:10:33.108Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NNdpkoIEayQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/zppVYRv_MOk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108155209521272576460", "textDisplay": "Follow the money."}}]}, "z13lvvlj2vzfgrxfg22azxfqoyegx1bdd": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC26eRte52qgZXYcLeJImFLA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-c2os_6ySwFE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEo/0Dt1NqIlnT8/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "SamD", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-31T04:12:50.388Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC26eRte52qgZXYcLeJImFLA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.09841799999999995, "formal_score": 9, "updatedAt": "2014-08-31T04:12:50.388Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117289217845236715549", "textDisplay": "It would be so much easier if death squads were formed so they can take out \nthese Nazi cocksuckers ! ! !\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ktlbalkm4tbefq22jed255zjwiz0xf04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8xlhaKN3S0PRQSvHCIC4Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-II5eGU67bmA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABBU/-MCsrTDrTrs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.38022813688212925, "authorDisplayName": "Dani Vox", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-22T00:44:32.630Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCr8xlhaKN3S0PRQSvHCIC4Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.76010200000000006, "formal_score": 89, "updatedAt": "2015-09-22T00:44:32.630Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114803053713636359590", "textDisplay": "a true patriot is a christian, wiccan, buddhist, atheist, anyone who truly \nsupports our freedoms in our constitution. radical christian dominionists \nwho want americans to beleive the revisionist lie that we were founded by \nchristians, for christians are wackjobs. the founders were deists. only one \nfounder was a christian. none were atheists either. i will not put up with \nthe religious terrorists who want to force christian shariah or islamic \nshariah on my country. i refuse to be a part of any religions desire for an \namerican theocracy. 57 percent of the right wing christian population in \nthis country want a christian theocracy. they too need to be stopped. they \ninvade our secular society, our public schools, etc. the extreme left also \nwants a global corporate technocracy. both sides are fucked up.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12hefuzhsarevmut22puv4aaqqrez3pl04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 1, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMPK1mi2wtvZEoGaJGKsUMw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Jotunnheimr", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-02T21:10:35.846Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCMPK1mi2wtvZEoGaJGKsUMw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.28042199999999995, "formal_score": 21, "updatedAt": "2014-12-02T21:10:35.846Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111281979465464264862", "textDisplay": "One logical fallacy and malicious lie after another, good lord.

"+Tallon Conwell In 1987 there was some consideration given to the \npossibility that the \"Aids epidemic may have been triggered by the mass \nvaccination campaign which eradicated smallpox\". An article[2] in The Times \nsuggested this, quoting an unnamed \"adviser to WHO\" with \"I believe the \nsmallpox vaccine theory is the explanation to the explosion of Aids\". It is \nnow thought that the smallpox vaccine causes serious complications for \npeople who already have impaired immune systems, and the Times article \ndescribed the case of a military recruit with \"dormant HIV\" who died within \nmonths of receiving it. But no citation was provided regarding people who \ndid not previously have HIV. (HIV is now considered to be a \ncontraindication for the smallpox vaccine\u2014both for an infected person and \ntheir sexual partners and household members.[3][4]) Some conspiracy \ntheorists propose an expanded hypothesis in which the smallpox vaccine was \ndeliberately 'laced' with HIV.[5] In contrast, a research article was \npublished in 2010 suggesting that it might have been the actual eradication \nof smallpox and the subsequent ending of the mass vaccination campaign that \ncontributed to the sudden emergence of HIV, due to the possibility that \nimmunization against smallpox \"might play a role in providing an individual \nwith some degree of protection to subsequent HIV infection and/or disease \nprogression\".[6][7] Regardless of the effects of the smallpox vaccine \nitself, its use in practice in Africa is one of the categories of \nun-sterile injection that may have contributed to the spread and mutation \nof the immunodeficiency viruses.[8]"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOZynL-ctT9h-Ni9Fcj9c-A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Mike Young", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133zn1ztzjggdgev23nzvlwjuf3fb2ck", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-07T16:48:59.830Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOZynL-ctT9h-Ni9Fcj9c-A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.55166800000000005, "formal_score": 9, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-07-07T16:48:59.830Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100112490564188900833", "textDisplay": "+mexjmort\ni'd like to get the unemployment i was denied by the corporate company that \nlaid me off whilei look for more work but i'm to afraid of being called a \nparasite for collecting the money I PAID INTO......moron."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKW6tm7-f7q7ITNlG0gbgIQ", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "mexjmort", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133zn1ztzjggdgev23nzvlwjuf3fb2ck", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-07-03T22:42:31.335Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKW6tm7-f7q7ITNlG0gbgIQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.48595000000000005, "formal_score": 99, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-07-03T22:42:31.335Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/104458148163852326540", "textDisplay": "+Reich-Wing Watch\nHate is a product of welfare to millions illegals\nShare your welfare whit illegals PARASITE"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLhGoWhoL_g2W_pR6gjpuzg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Ace Boogs", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133zn1ztzjggdgev23nzvlwjuf3fb2ck", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-27T05:30:00.693Z", "likeCount": 2, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLhGoWhoL_g2W_pR6gjpuzg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.97419389999999995, "formal_score": 7, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-27T05:30:00.693Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wpO7ralC36Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACyI/uwYFom5ESTk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100957380547276127447", "textDisplay": "+Zhuge Naut lmao r u dumb u really believe whites brought aids to africa \nlnmfaooooo"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXQR-pnJHG-RpmGEXWw8-2A", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Zhuge Naut", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z133zn1ztzjggdgev23nzvlwjuf3fb2ck", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-04-20T02:43:04.717Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXQR-pnJHG-RpmGEXWw8-2A"}, "sentiment_score": -0.16043800000000003, "formal_score": 19, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-04-20T02:43:04.717Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-luONPKBPhIE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/kX8KT13LLSU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112195519671912999942", "textDisplay": "Lmfao.

It was the US who led the effort \nto hold high ranking officials of Nazi Germany and Japan accountable for \ntheir actions in the Nuremberg and Tokyo post-WWII trials.\n\nHaving said that, I think the best word that can be chosen to express how \nthose in the center and left feel is more one of frustration than of \ndisappointment.\n\nAmericans tend to over-estimate the powers that any President has, and in \nmany ways, because of our Constitutional system, a President has fewer \npowers than Prime Ministers in a Parliamentary system who command a strong \nmajority in their Parliament.\n\nHere, with the separation of those two branches, we have often had cases \nwhere one party controlled Congress (or even just one chamber of Congress, \nwhich is all that party would need to completely frustrate the President's \nagenda, should they wish to), while the other controlled the Executive \nBranch.\n\nThe determination of the GOP to frustrate Obama's agenda (the promises he \nmade to the voters during his campaigns) has largely left those commitments \nunfulfilled. This is not any fault of Obama's. From the time he was first \nInaugurated as President, they publicly announced (often using their bully \npulpit with Fox News and conservative talk radio) their intention to do \neverything possible to cause the failure of Obama's Presidency.\n\nAnd while they have not been completely successful in doing so, they have \nmanaged to stop or slow down a great deal more than most Americans realize.\n\nThere are other systemic problems that need fixing as well, such as the \nwidespread gerrymandering of Congressional districts, attempts to suppress \nthe vote of African Americans and other minorities, and the Republican \neffort in the Senate to filibuster the confirmation votes of large numbers \nof vacant judicial and executive branch nominees.\n\nOur system DEPENDS on the two parties (in the past not as ideological as \ntoday -- less than 50 years ago there were liberal Republicans and \nconservative Democrats) compromising with each other so that the business \nof government can go on, and major problems be dealt with.\n\nBut to the Tea Party branch of the GOP, compromise is seen as surrender, \nand those Republicans (even prominent conservatives such as former Senator \nDick Lugar from Indiana) have been purged (or \"primaried\" a new word here) \nby even more reactionary Tea Party candidates.\n\nAnd then there is the pervasive corruption of politics at just about every \nlevel by a system of bribery (euphemistically called \"campaign donations\") \nwhich the Supreme Court has incredibly ruled to be protected speech as laid \nout in the First Amendment. It's extremely ironic, because the conservative \nmembers of the court claim to favor strict constructionism in interpreting \nthe Constitution, yet I doubt the Founders EVER intended protecting such \ncorrupting practices.\n\nSo there is also mounting frustration over these problems which are not of \nObama's doing, but which preceded his first campaign for the Presidency.\n\nBut you are correct in saying that the reasons those of us on the left are \ndisappointed feel that way NOT because we think that the President has been \nTOO liberal (and populist), but not liberal enough.\n\nAnd it is likely that most Americans would favor Obama again. He is FAR \nbetter than almost all leading Republicans. The GOP controlled House has \nfar worse favorability polling than the President. And to give one an idea \nof what they have been doing, instead of dealing with serious issues, the \nHouse has held more than 50 votes to repeal the ACA (Obamacare), even \nthough they knew that there was no realistic chance of that happening.\n\nThe question this November is how many people will actually come out and \nvote -- Americans suffer from campaign fatigue, with what would be general \nelections every two years in a Parliamentary system. So most stay home, \nunless it is a Presidential election. That is another flaw in the system.\n\nBut you have expressed the true mood of the majority of Americans. \nExcellent comment.\n "}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6HVcL-yhvFCIJiFN6tfmIg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MrTubs911", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12hvprzotqohi0ckmzkut0j3sqesflc1", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-04T22:09:20.016Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC6HVcL-yhvFCIJiFN6tfmIg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.12021999999999999, "formal_score": 10, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-04T22:09:20.016Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110440745909302200512", "textDisplay": "+HelloSatanHere And what part of my writing is not true??????

Their reach, however, has been somewhat limited to \nfringe audiences.\n\nIt might be tempting to throw Jonah Goldberg's Liberal Fascism: The Secret \nHistory of the American Left from Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning into \nthose same cloacal backwaters, but there is an essential difference that \ngoes well beyond the likely much broader reach of Goldberg's book, which \nwas inexplicably published by a mainstream house (Doubleday). Most \nrevisionists are actually historians with some credentials, and their \ntheses often hinge on nuances and the interpretation of details.\n\nGoldberg, who has no credentials beyond the right-wing nepotism that has \nenabled his career as a pundit, has drawn a kind of history in absurdly \nbroad and comically wrongheaded strokes. It is not just history done badly, \nor mere revisionism. It\u2019s a caricature of reality, like something from a \ncomic-book alternative universe: Bizarro history.\n\nThe title alone is enough to indicate its thoroughgoing incoherence: Of all \nthe things we know about fascism and the traits that comprise it, one of \nthe few things that historians will readily agree upon is its overwhelming \nanti-liberalism. One might as well write about anti-Semitic \nneoconservatism, or Ptolemaic quantum theory, or strength in ignorance. \nGoldberg isn't content to simply create an oxymoron; this entire \nenterprise, in fact, is classic Newspeak.\n\nIndeed, Goldberg even makes some use of Orwell, noting that the author of \n1984 once dismissed the misuse of \"fascism\" as meaning \"something not \ndesirable.\" Of course, Orwell was railing against the loss of the word's \nmeaning, while Goldberg, conversely, revels in it -- he refers to Orwell's \ncritique as his \"definition of fascism.\"\nAnd then Goldberg proceeds to define everything that he himself considers \nundesirable as \"fascist.\" This is just about everything even remotely and \nvaguely thought of as \"liberal\": vegetarianism, Social Security, \nmulticulturalism, the \"war on poverty,\" \"the politics of meaning.\" The \nfigures he labels as fascist range from Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. \nRoosevelt to Lyndon B. Johnson and Hillary Clinton. Goldberg's primary \nachievement is to rob the word of all meaning -- Newspeak incarnate.\n\nThe term \"fascism\" certainly is overused and abused. The public \nunderstanding of it is fuzzy at best, and academics struggle to agree on a \ndefinition, as Goldberg observes -- and he makes use of that confusion to \nramble on for pages about the disagreements without ever providing readers \nwith a clear definition of fascism beyond Orwell's quip.\n\nAlong the way, he grotesquely misrepresents the state of academia regarding \nthe study of fascism, which, while widely varying in many regards, has seen \na broad consensus develop regarding certain ineluctable traits that are \nuniquely and definitively fascist: its populism and ultranationalism, its \nanti-intellectualism, its carefully groomed culture of violence, its \ninsistence that it represents the true national identity, its treatment of \ndissent as treason, and what Oxford Brookes scholar Roger Griffin calls its \n\"palingenesis\" -- that is, its core myth of a phoenix-like rebirth of the \nnational identity in the mold of a nonexistent Golden Age. And, of course, \nit has historically always been vigorously -- no, viciously -- anti-liberal.\nSo when Goldberg proclaims early on: \"This is the monumental fact of the \nNazi rise to power that has been slowly airbrushed from our collective \nmemories: the Nazis campaigned as socialists,\" more thorough observers of \nhistory might instead just shake their heads. After all, the facts of \nMussolini's utopian/socialist origins and the Nazis' similar appeals to \nsocialism by incorporating the name are already quite well known to the \nsame historians who consistently describe fascism as a right-wing \nenterprise.\n\nWhat these historians record -- but Goldberg variously ignores or minimizes \n-- is that the \"socialism\" of \"National Socialism\" was in fact purely a \nkind of ethnic economic nationalism, which offered \"socialist\" support to \npurely \"Aryan\" German business entities, and that the larger Nazi cultural \nappeal was built directly around an open antipathy to all things liberal or \nleftist. Indeed, whole chapters of Mein Kampf are devoted to vicious smears \nand declarations of war against \"the Left,\" and not merely the Marxism that \nGoldberg acknowledges was a major focus of Hitler's animus.\nThis became manifest in the Italian fascist and German Nazi transformations \nfrom a faction of street thugs into an actual political power that seized \nthe reins of government, when fascists gradually shed all pretensions or \nappeals to socialism and became violently anti-socialist and \nanti-communist. But it was present all along; \"the Left\" were the people \nwho were beaten and murdered in the 1920s by the squadristi and the \nBrownshirts; and the first Germans sent off to Nazi concentration camps \nlike Dachau were not Jews but socialists, communists, and other left-wing \npolitical prisoners, including \"liberal\" priests and clerics.\n\nThe same incoherence underlies what Goldberg imagines is his provocative \nthesis: the notion that \"modern progressivism and classical fascism shared \nthe same intellectual roots,\" and therefore that \"fascism, properly \nunderstood, is not a phenomenon of the right at all. Instead, it is, and \nalways has been, a phenomenon of the left.\" The core of this claim is his \ninsistent description of populism as a form of left-wing politics -- which, \nin many of its manifestations, it certainly was.\nYet Goldberg incorrectly claims that \"populism had never been known as a \nconservative or right phenomenon before\" Mussolini. In fact, populism has \nhistorically been a broad-ranging phenomenon that expressed itself in both \nright- and left-wing politics, as Chip Berlet has described in some detail \nin his 2000 book, Right-Wing Populism in America, which details its history \nfrom Bacon's Rebellion to the Ku Klux Klan to the modern-day Posse \nComitatus and militia/Patriot movements. What distinguishes these populists \nfrom their left-wing counterparts, as Berlet explains, is that \"they \ncombine attacks on socially oppressed groups with grassroots mass \nmobilization and distorted forms of antielitism based on scapegoating.\" \nYet, building on a false characterization of the history of populism, \nGoldberg goes on to characterize such historical figures as Father Charles \nCoughlin, the rabid anti-Semitic radio talker of the 1930s, and Sen. Joe \nMcCarthy as left-wing figures simply because of their populist foundations.\n\nMore to the point, perhaps, is that discussing fascism's \"intellectual \nfoundations\" is a nonsensical enterprise in the face of the consensus of \nhistorical understanding that anti-intellectualism is an essential trait of \nfascism, a fact that Goldberg briefly acknowledges without assessing its \nimpact on his thesis. As Umberto Eco put it, the fascist insistence on \naction for its own sake means that \"it must be taken before, or without, \nreflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.\" In this worldview, the \ninstincts of the fascist leader are always superior to the logic and reason \nof puling intellectuals.\n\nProbably the essential fascist statement is one that Goldberg in fact cites \nunreflectingly -- Mussolini's famous reply to those who wanted policy \nspecifics from him: \"The democrats of Il Mondo want to know our program? It \nis to break the bones of the democrats of Il Mondo. And the sooner the \nbetter.\" This remark's noteworthy anti-liberalism also seems to elude \nGoldberg. And the notion that liberal humanism -- with its long history of \nrationalism and reliance on logic and science -- has anything whatsoever to \ndo with the fascist approach is, once again, an almost comical upending of \nreality.\n\nLiberal Fascism is like a number of other recent attempts at historical \nrevisionism by popular right-wing pundits -- including, notably, Michelle \nMalkin's attempt to justify the Japanese-American internment in her book In \nDefense of Internment, and Ann Coulter's attempt to rehabilitate McCarthy's \nreputation in her book Treason -- in that it employs the same historical \nmethodology used by Holocaust deniers and other right-wing revanchists: \nnamely, it selects a narrow band of often unrepresentative facts, distorts \ntheir meaning, and simultaneously elides and ignores whole mountains of \ncontravening evidence and broader context. These are simply theses in \nsearch of support, not anything like serious history.\n\nWhat goes missing from Goldberg's account of fascism is that, while he \ndescribes nearly every kind of liberal enterprise or ideology as \nrepresenting American fascism, he wipes from the pages of history the fact \nthat there have been fascists operating within the nation's culture for the \nbetter part of the past century. Robert O. Paxton, in his book The Anatomy \nof Fascism, identifies the Ku Klux Klan as the first genuine fascist \norganization, a suggestion that Goldberg airily dismisses with the dumb \nexplanation that the Klan of the 1920s disliked Mussolini and his adherents \nbecause they were Italian (somewhat true for a time but irrelevant in terms \nof their ideological affinities, which were substantial enough that by the \n1930s, historians have noted, there were frequent operative associations \nbetween Klan leaders and European fascists).\n\nBeyond the Klan, completely missing from the pages of Goldberg's book is \nany mention of the Silver Shirts, the American Nazi Party, the Posse \nComitatus, the Aryan Nations, or the National Alliance -- all of them \nopenly fascist organizations, many of them involved in some of the nation's \nmost horrific historical events. (The Oklahoma City bombing, for instance, \nwas the product of a blueprint drawn up by the National Alliance's William \nPierce.) Goldberg sees fit to declare people like Wilson, FDR, LBJ, and \nHillary Clinton \"American fascists,\" but he makes no mention of William \nDudley Pelley, Gerald L.K. Smith, George Lincoln Rockwell, William Potter \nGale, Richard Butler, or David Duke -- all of them bona fide fascists: the \nreal thing.\n\nThis is a telling omission, because the continuing existence of these \ngroups makes clear what an absurd and nakedly self-serving thing Goldberg's \nalternate version of reality is. Why dream up fascists on the left when the \nreality is that real American fascists have been lurking in the right's \ncloset for lo these many years? Well, maybe because it's a handy way of \ngetting everyone to forget that fact.\n\nLiberal Fascism may come complete with copious but meaningless footnotes, \nbut it is in the end just a gussied-up version of a favorite talking point \nof right-wing radio talkers that the real fascists are those nasty \nliberals, those feminazis and eco-fascists. It may be all dressed up with a \npseudo-academic veneer, but the quality of logic contained therein is \nroughly the same. If only it would vanish into the ether as quickly."}}]}, "z12yzfe41tbru1giv04chdtxtnezilcghew": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 10, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN3MtG5uVEFGwv9dPAZKtSg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ls4rOZrkb78/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEg/t-hb2ssOzqg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 3.7037037037037037, "authorDisplayName": "SUEDOMIZA", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-02T06:26:13.720Z", "videoId": "1OHQ5oMywMk", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCN3MtG5uVEFGwv9dPAZKtSg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.68436399999999997, "formal_score": 72, "updatedAt": "2015-09-02T06:26:13.720Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108107298792896071794", "textDisplay": "Alex Jones is not racist , and neither is Ron Paul.\nThis video is bullshit!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN3MtG5uVEFGwv9dPAZKtSg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "SUEDOMIZA", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12yzfe41tbru1giv04chdtxtnezilcghew", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-19T17:54:48.900Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCN3MtG5uVEFGwv9dPAZKtSg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.97178620000000004, "formal_score": 94, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-19T17:54:48.900Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ls4rOZrkb78/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEg/t-hb2ssOzqg/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108107298792896071794", "textDisplay": "I'm neither left wing or right wing\n\nYour argument is completey invalid."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqNWJOeBOBSF1pm9tjGnKhg", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Reich-Wing Watch", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12yzfe41tbru1giv04chdtxtnezilcghew", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-09-19T15:49:59.873Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCqNWJOeBOBSF1pm9tjGnKhg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.52300999999999997, "formal_score": 53, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2015-09-19T15:50:46.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eQNr85s2pgo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAArc/fXlGhHIdPvQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112592753639445040055", "textDisplay": "+SUEDOMIZA LOL!
