The first video which \nsupposedly shows him committing a robbery and yet this video had huge black \noutlines around the persons, kind of looks like a photo shop, whereas the \nsecond photo just showing him getting goods So I actually think you have \nreally stepped in it here and fell for the same ole story the cops always \nput out discredit the witness and criminalize the victim it is not like \nthey have not done this before because they have. Nor does it take away the \nfact hands in the air is the universal sign for surrender. Nor does it take \naway from the fact that the cop that shot him was totally unaware of the \nconvenience store robbery.  Seems to me that you are just like CNN and \ndon't get it.\n CNN really don't get it, talk about out of touch. This killing of the \nunarmed teenager is not new. This has happened all over this country and \nall over this nation. And now today they come out and say no charges will \nbe brought against the Officer who unloaded his fire arm into a unarmed \ncitizen.  I can not believe the blindness of the people. I can not believe \nthe cops don't get that they are being used. Well I understand they know \nstepping up or speaking out will not only cost them their jobs but could \nvery much cost them their lives. After all the mafia don't take kindly to \npeople who speak out. They already shown what they are capable of doing to \na whistle blower they did this years ago in New York City. A city owned by \nthe mob in those days that continues on to today. Francesco Vincent Serpico \nwho was a New York police officer who blew the whistle on police \ncorruption. Who survived a assassination attempt. Does any one really \nbelieve that has changed? This happened in the late sixties early \nseventies.  That is fact and history. Most recent was this case that was \nall over the news Christopher Dorner, 33, an honorably discharged Navy \nReservist and former Los Angeles police officer. Do know it is alleged that \nhe murdered two people, and the facebook manifesto means nothing because \nthere is no evidence it was him who posted it, after all our government via \nthe NSA monitors face book and all of google. I think Christopher Dorner \nwanted to warn the american public and those criminals made him an example \nof what happens to any officer who dares cross that thin blue line. After \nall it is not like they have not done anything like this before. It has \nbeen a week and any recordings, or video's could be altered in that time. \nEspecially videos, tell me what the black outlines over what is suppose to \nbe Mike Brown sure looks altered to me. That video needs looked at by \nexperts independent experts because I question why the black outlines \naround the people in the video. It truly is a non issue because the facts \nof the matter are still the same  MIKE BROWN CITIZEN HAS HANDS UP IN THE \nAIR IN UNIVERSAL SURRENDER. This is a much bigger issue people. They are \nattempting to start a civil war. This is not a white black issue. The \nissues are as follows.\n\nThis is what most Americans believe that the police are there to protect \nand serve. True they are but now fantasy and reality have met in Missouri. \nThe police do not protect and serve the people but their owners.\n\nNow those same agent provokers will attempt to escalate that situation with \nhow the information has come out. Then they release that the officer will \nnot face any charges. They want a civil war to hide their crimes. Don't do \nit America.  I say that we the people are in a unique position here to do a \nsmack down but it requires using the very tools they created to control us \nand turn it around.\n\nBody cams should be worn by every elected official and every police \nofficer, every court member from clerks to judges. Their phones need to be \nmonitored. This needs to be done to ensure that our republic form of \ngovernment is upheld. These recordings should be handled by a grand jury \nappointed by the people and these appointments will be done privately by \nrandom selection. They control the audio, video. At no time should the \ncontrols ever be released to the elected officials or cops. For us to be a \nnation of laws it means all laws must apply to all people at all times.\n\nBecause we the people are being lied to by our elected leaders. We have \ntreason that is systemic and has been going on for years. They have used \nthe story lines.\n\nRight now in Missouri they are painting their last crime over with a forged \nvideo and criminalizing the victim. They did the same thing with Ruby Ridge \nand Waco. They murdered 81 citizens in Waco after falsely imprisoning them \nin their homes. They accused them of stock piling weapons and child abuse. \nYet produced no evidence People do you not recognize this? OMG they do this \nover and over and over. Did you know that the ones who were arrested and \nsurvived the fire were all acquitted?\n\nDid you hear the cops wanting to have the ability to turn the video/audio \nbody cams on and off that wearing them for eight hours would violate their \nprivacy? Do they worry about the citizen's privacy? Again they want to \nexempt them selves from a solution the citizens should demand. Body cams on \nelected officials to be reviewed by a private selection of citizens to \nmonitor their behaviors would preserve our civil rights. It is not my \nneighbor who can start a war, or make drug deals with drug lords they don't \nhave the correct pay scale for that activity. Have we not in this country \nfigured out who the American drug lords are yet? OMG they put it out there \nin your face when they refused to bring criminal charges against HSBS for \nlaundering 7.5 billion in the drug cartel's money. That is treason, that is \na direct attack on our economy, that was a act of war. \n\nTO BE A NATION OF LAWS MEANS THAT THE LAWS MUST APPLY TO ALL PEOPLE AT ALL \nTIMES.  It does not mean some are exempt.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z131ffpyhynnf5u4d04cdvjyuqjvwrorcxc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeM3iGQwx5ipjmdB2rCp41w", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UwqpLv7mqrg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANM/s-cIZZd_xdE/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Purple Penquin", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-16T10:08:54.320Z", "videoId": "WSnzV_rPvNc", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeM3iGQwx5ipjmdB2rCp41w"}, "sentiment_score": -0.10411600000000004, "formal_score": 6, "updatedAt": "2014-08-16T10:08:54.320Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112963075298159234972", "textDisplay": "\"these people?\"  Man, you raycis!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13kupxxerefgriuq23vulwolymhef512": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzGhGWKnbbV8PBK8JAPVKoA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-orPu8EsMf88/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/SwiNb5Rv1nA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Resale Living", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-15T21:19:58.265Z", "videoId": "WSnzV_rPvNc", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCzGhGWKnbbV8PBK8JAPVKoA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.94359369999999998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-15T21:19:58.265Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105757407705363367408", "textDisplay": "YOU'RE A RACIST!

So he perhaps instinctively \nor out of rage shot him initially then DECIDED it was best to kill off \nMichael than to have two sides if the story.\n\nIt was a \"decision\" because it took the officer over 60 seconds (according \nto the 3rd person involved) to get out of the car and fire his weapon a 2nd \nthen a 3rd time w/ as many as 8 rounds entering Michael. \n\n3 separate distances to shoot 1 min apart is NOT self defense, it's a \ncalculated move. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ys1dy0virxl0z504cfjzxqzftuzkhcgk": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_xM1fA_IVOVE80VrZm6gnA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "ster ssett", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-11-30T16:21:01.284Z", "videoId": "WSnzV_rPvNc", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC_xM1fA_IVOVE80VrZm6gnA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.21176200000000001, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-11-30T16:21:01.284Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108200924606009765526", "textDisplay": "I still can't hear any of the conversation due to it just being video.  \nEveryone is jumping to conclusions about the incident in the store.

What do you now?      \n\nIf you conclude that the Chief intentionally lied, why do you think he did \nthat?   Do you think it was the first time he had done that?        Do you \nthink that those protestors have heard those kinds of misrepresentations \nbefore?   If they have, would that explain some things?    \n\n Last, I wonder if you would connect the dots for all of us.  You said \n(para-phrase) that if it was Michal Brown the medias narrative about what \noccurred would have a huge whole.    Connect the dots.

So when a officer notices someone they can't handle and they \nare alone there's no protocol for that? No back up called? No let me follow \ntil help comes? The only hole in anything is the hole in logic. There are \npolices and procedures in ALL departments they need to be followed \nregardless of how scared you are. Two against one it seemed so what is the \nprocedure? What's the protocol. This officer engaged with him and the \nfriend in total confidence and for me it was because he knew he had a gun \nvs a 6+ talk man and another. If Michael Brown allegedly robbed a store and \nwas a suspect and was approached by said officer, was procedure followed? \nBecause someone is dead and it's not the officer. If this man was running, \ndid he need to be shot? Or chased? Followed or killed? Two wrongs don't \nmake a right is my point. And I like your reports Chris but I just ask that \nyou don't stir the pot of this man being looked at as the reason for his \nown death when clearly procedure wasn't followed and no weapon was found on \nhim or the scene Or has yet to be reported. Even in the video that show \n(allegedly)Michael Brown robbing a store there wasn't a weapon visible. \nJust a physical altercation. He may have been wrong but didn't need to be \nshot because someone who is suppose to protect and serve, protected himself \nand served his department. Intimidation is flawed. On both sides.

In no case using the threat of bodily harm to \nrob someone is listed in the dictionary as a \"dick head thing\". Without a \ndoubt, Michael Brown committed a crime of robbery. Guilty!!

The robbery at that point only served as \nto reflect on his character, which is now in question due to the mothers \ndepiction of her son's good behavior, and non violence.

Their position of \npower makes them arrogant, and bullies. Over the past couple of years \nthings have been getting worst with them violating our constitutional \nrights, and literally getting away with murder. Since the rise in use of \nvideo technology we now see and capture these brutalities, and murders \nbeing committed by our own law enforcement. If we want to make a \ndifference, we need to capture these on going crimes on video, then change \nthe laws, because if we don't, we will have cases like this, where their \nwill be doubt.

You \nassume the high moral and intellectual ground and even touch on the \nmilitarization of our police! The kudos duly noted,there are two more peaks \nthat are vital to scale to see the big picture clearly. The next step is to \npull back the lens 150 years or so further and put the last 50 to 60 years \nof civil rights friction in perspective. The full century of horrific \nabuses of blacks AFTER they were officially declared \"free\" all but ensured \nthat the pendulum would swing as far and as powerfully towards reverse \nracism (affirmative action) and riots like Ferguson. The overt race baiting \nof the Sharpton/Jackson crowd and all the biased blather from the talking \nheads on the left indeed serves to pick at the scabs and pour salt in the \nalready festering wounds, but it's sad that so few conservatives join me \nhere in the bleeding heart libertarian center and vocally condemn that ugly \ncentury. (And libs need to come to grips with two facts. The first is that, \nwhile racism was hardly unheard of in the northeast or other areas, \nSouthern Democrats bear the brunt of the culpability for that century of \nabuse; it was the GOP who pushed civil rights against staunch opposition of \nracist Dems like Sen KKK Byrd, Sen Al Gore Senior, and others. The second \nfact is that they are intellectually bankrupt when they single out the \nFounders and lambaste them for being a bunch of evil white hypocrites; in \nfact they were one of the first major societies in the entire history of \nthe planet to even try to wipe out the scourge of slavery, which was \nuniversally much more about power than race even though it evolved into a \nracial issue here.)\n\nThe last segment in our climb to see the big picture in proper perspective \nis to ponder the fact that all the struggles of humanity are natural and to \nbe expected given how cruel nature is. For scores of thousands of years we \nwere literally just another part of the food chain, and relatively low on \nit at that. For almost 4,900 of the 5,000 years or so since we learned to \nuse writing we didn\u2019t even have anesthesia or antibiotics, much less \nI-phones and wireless technology. Even today, just living is fraught with \nunthinkable catastrophes. It\u2019s an act of faith just getting up and stepping \nout the door every day! All the excruciating pain and fear accumulates in \nour shared, planetary brain like junk DNA and unconsciously colors \neverything most people do and say. Investing the time to train ourselves to \nbear this in mind allows us to begin to be more patient with many \nshortcomings in the typical political views of each half of the mainstream \nvoting block who take turns bludgeoning each other (and me!) with the \nfedgov club as soon as one side or the other gains a temporary 51-49% \nadvantage on any given issue. We need a strong fedgov, and the Constitution \naffords one, but we MUST raise the bar before imposing our will on each \nother!\n\nLiberals and progressives really mean well, but they inflict far more \ndamage than they realize with their knee-jerk insistence on using the \nfedgov as their go-to solution. If we can encourage them to stop allowing \nso much invaluable blood to hemorrhage so  uselessly onto the ground and \ninstead let it circulate through the brain to complete the cycle, they \ncould join our efforts to promote healing. Their problem is that they care \nso much about the Hive Mind that they are willing to sacrifice the \nliberties of individual worker bees like me who do far more than the \naverage liberal to ground Unity Consciousness. The key is free will. \nLucifer and Jesus both respect this eternal principle \u2013 force must be \nrestricted to the defensive acts and punishments for crimes.\n\nJust as necessary and just as arduous of a task will be to get the average \nrepublican to see through the war mongering of the mainstream neocon wing \nof their party \u2013 they are as culpable as the Dems on every major issue for \nthe engineered decline of our Republic, from foreign policy and economics \nto education and immigration!\n\nThe great news is that we win in the end \u2013 access to the Future Perfect \nTense is restricted only by the limits of our imagination and ability to \ncloak our experiences there with words to share them with our brothers and \nsisters on earth. The not so good news is that we have our work cut out for \nus in the short and mid-term, and may have to suffer through a major \ndepression before we can wake up enough fellow Americans to for the \nmovement to hit critical mass.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12lzryztq2xx5zv122ditnbdz2oczuu2": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZOL7lOqs13UQQI0sbr_P2Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-TawipFUW4AA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/A7JOJNZQhWo/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "kingcobracorp", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-17T22:20:09.855Z", "videoId": "WSnzV_rPvNc", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZOL7lOqs13UQQI0sbr_P2Q"}, "sentiment_score": 0.26858000000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-17T22:20:09.855Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114509465081136504494", "textDisplay": "Oh my god.

Give me a \nfucking break, and to make it even better, the same people chanting for \njustice, are the same people that felt that it was ok, to riot and loot \nstores in their own community!  WTF is wrong with you people in \nFerguson!!!???. Why is this shit ALWAYS about color or race!!!  when in \nreality land this punk probably gave the cop an attitude just like he had \nin the video and got himself killed.. Karma claims another..\n\nSorry but the reality of this whole story is simple, and we've ALL seen it \nbefore. Here you have yet ANOTHER typical Hard ass black man, that believes \nthat he's better than anyone else. Walks with a lean, wears his pants like \nhe's homeless and carries himself like that black man with an attitude \nproblem. We've ALL seen this type of person several times over i'm \nsure..He's so above everyone else that he believes that it is 100% ok to \nrob a store and bully the clerk. Typical..  He walks around with a chip on \nhis shoulder thinking he's invincible, a cop tells him to stop walking in \nthe middle of the street, defenses are already up from the robbery and he \nstarts up with the cop and gets killed, now this cop is being tried for \ncriminal charges!? because he took the actions he felt were necessary to \navoid whatever violent action this guy was ready to dish out. The entry \nwounds were from the FRONT! come on people this isn't that hard to grasp. \nBrown also had a very colorful criminal record apparently.. put the pieces \ntogether yourself...\n\nAll these protestors care about is fighting with the police. I've seen this \nso many times before. If the chance arises for a \"protest\" against cops, \nall kinds of people come out of the woodwork! a lot of these \"protesters\" \naren't even from Ferguson!!! Like is said, just something else to blame on \nracism and I would wage money on the fact that at least half of these \n\"protesters\" simple have nothing else better to do and could care less \nabout the point of protesting.

It's like \nsaying yeah I have cancer but plenty of people have cancer. They are all \nproblems that need to be dealt with. We however are talking specifically \nabout a black community. Of course you reference the civil rights movement \nand Jim Crow. Unfortunately since then we've had decades of unproportionate \nhigh rates of violence that aline with a systematic social engineering \nperpetrated on and accepted by the black community by the government.\n\nYou think media going to fix the problem as if I've gained my perspective \nfrom the media. I gained my perspective on what I witnessed going in black \ncommunities in the projects and west side of Chicago. I'm basing my \nperspective in the change I witnessed in neighborhoods in Rockford Il after \nthe black community moved in. As well as communities in Fayetteville NC, \nAugusta Georgia, and Milwaukii WI. I'm basing my perspective on how the \nblack classmates in a training course divided themselves into house and \nfield niggers and called the only one of them that objected an Uncle Tom. I \ncan go on if you want.\n\nBlack Excellence? Are you implying excellence is a standard the the black \ncommunity can not achieve. If so you should be offended. Or are you \nimplying that black excellence is a height that only the black community \ncan achieve? Either way I'm offended. Haven't we all learned that separate \nbut equal does not work.\n\nUncle Tom is a reference to Uncle Tom's Cabin a slave character an \nincredible passive and obedient demeanor and a zealot like admiration \nwhites. I have heard it used by friends in context to describe people that \nwere not adhering to what they perceived as black standards and not brown \nnosing. Seeing how this is a slave refference it could be said that using \nit is slave language. So no I have never heard any other group use \nequivalent language. \n\nSo what about self preservation? After all it is hypocritical to claim to \nsupport the preservation of life without the discretion to preserve it \nagainst a perceived threat. Seeing how I as an unarmed 185 pound man is \ncapable of permanently injuring, incapacitating, and killing a person. As \nsomeone that actively trains I am well aware of the proportionate \ncapability to do damage with weight. Although in an physical incident I \nalways consider the other person a serious threat but I take that threat in \nproportion to size of the other person.\n\nNow what distance was he shot? Was he rushing the officer or did you have \nhis hands up? Did he assault the officer or did the officer pull him into \nthe car? No one other than the officer and the witnesses can say. And that \nbeing said witness testimony is notoriously unreliable. That being said we \nshould respect the possible need for the officers self preservation \nproportionate to the threat as well as possibility of the officer acting \nunethically.\n\nYeah I jumped the gun when I called you racist. Unfortunately most of the \npeople supporting mike brown that I have seen has turned this nto a race \nissue. I apologize.

And I WILL give you \ncredit for correctly using the word \"assailant\" Unless of course, you don't \nknow what the word means. And in that case...here.. .. lmao \n[ Assailant- noun.  A person who physically attacks another. ~Well, \nwhatda'ya know? You said it yourself!\"\n\n-I used \"alleged assailant\" because according the officer + witnesses there \nwas allegedly some sort of scuffle between Brown + the cop (there is not an \nofficial police report outlining the nature of this scuffle i.e. how or why \nit started). \n\n-Therefore, yes, Brown is an alleged assailant who was fleeing. However, as \nI have mentioned elsewhere... the autopsy reveals that Brown was shot at a \ndistance. The examiner said that he ruled out the possibility of Brown \nbeing shot during the physical altercation. Therefore, I strongly believe \nthat other measures could have been taken to subdue Brown as opposed to \nkilling him. Hopefully further investigation, evidence, witness testimony, \nand ultimately a trial will shed more light here.\n\n\"AND THERE LIES THE MAIN  PROBLEM HERE. You say his only crime was jay \nwalking? LMAO  I can't tell you how many times I have heard that and it is \nutter stupidity. Anyone who wants to get into an altercation  and fight \nwith an officer while allegedly trying to wrestle with him trying to get \nhis gun then trying to flee  THEN bum rushing the officer is an idiot! \n PERIOD  (ALL are from different  witness statements except the one I said \n'allegedly' because I don't remember if anyone was witness to that. Well, \nyou seem to be doing an awful lot of assuming here, too.  \"His only crime \nwas jaywalking\"  you say.  SMH !!!  Incredible. o_O\"\n\n-The Ferguson police chief stated that Mike Brown was confronted by officer \nDarren Wilson for jay-walking. It is the only crime, at the sight of the \ncrime, that has been confirmed by the officers + witnesses. He was not \nconfronted for shoplifting/robbing. I think one of the main problems here \nis that there is a huge gap regarding the order of events that took place \nbetween the verbal confrontation initiated by officer Darren Wilson and the \ndeath of Mike Brown.  I think one of the main problems here is that this \nstory has been sensationalized precisely because there are many gaps. The \nmedia has not given other comparable stories (where use of excessive force \nis more obvious due to video recordings) the same attention. I think one of \nthe main problems here is that there has not been a police report regarding \nthe alleged assault that lead to Brown's murder... there has been an \noverwhelming lack of transparency from the Ferguson police department. I \nthink another one of the main problems is the shady politics of power + \npolicies/protocol around appropriate policing.\n\n- Again, I look forward to the release of the official police report + \nadditional information from witness testimonies and forensic evidence. \nHowever, given the testimonies that have surfaced thus far and given the \ncandid statements captured on videos recorded immediately after the \nshooting I do believe that the death of Mike Brown could have and should \nhave been avoided. And as a humanist I want unnecessary deaths + abuse \ncaused by police officer's excessive use of force/ brutality to be \nregulated and punished with the same weight and frequency that we would \npunish civilian's unlawful violent behavior."}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSz8X2QWABsoehopbrkqHsw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "youtubed", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13tzdkxpof2ingf222tihzprsfautf3i", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-27T02:45:34.413Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCSz8X2QWABsoehopbrkqHsw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.34904200000000002, "formal_score": 12, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-27T02:49:36.000Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108097194922169146679", "textDisplay": "I refuse to read that produced by someone who can't write well enough to be \nconcise.\n\nWho wants to again eyes following someone who ramble, without spacing, and \nother visual clues.

Several \ngroups of people participate in or create counter cultures. In addition, \ncounter-cultures do not necessarily have a negative connotation. For \nexample, if you were to live in a country whose mainstream culture had a \nhistory of race-based oppression... If you spearhead and sustain a Civil \nRights Movement that successfully illuminates the inhumanity and injustice \nto the world at large, but also strategically fights to change the laws \npolicies and practices that disenfranchise certain citizens, then you also \nwould be a catalyst of creating a counter-culture + responsible for \ncharting a cultural paradigm shift.\n\nB) I think the term that you may have been searching for, but was resting \nfar outside of your lexicon, is \"social pathologies.\" If we are \"getting \nreal\" Black people and all other racial/ethnic groups have social \npathologies. What is more important is to understand and to examine the \nroot/origin/context regarding the existence of said pathologies. In other \nwords, what historical context, institutionalized ideas/values, and social \nstructures contribute to human behavior? It is not enough to observe the \ndysfunctional behavior. In order to absolve said behavior one has to also \nbe vocal about the history of institutionalized racism/white supremacy that \nhas created inequalities that still persist.\n\nI'd like to add that excessive violence, for example, is an American social \npathology. It is not just a Black American social pathology. Despite this \ntruth, inner-city gun violence is something that I want to work on \ndecreasing/eradicating because I'm from a neighborhood where it was a \nproblem. I've lost neighbors due to senseless gun violence. This brings me \nto my next point... There are organizations, community leaders, advocates, \nand civilians working fervently to address issues or social pathologies \nthat impact the Black diaspora and/or all people. It is incorrect to \ninsinuate that Blacks have \"accepted\" degernerate/exclusive conditions... \nas a group of people we've been working against the degenerate conditions \nthat we've inherited since slavery. However, it takes centuries to undo the \ndamage and trauma (physical and psychological) of systemic oppression, \ndisenfranchisement, generational poverty, and cycles of violence which are \nby-products of ante-bellum slavery + Jim Crow laws + inhumane attitudes \n(that have even been documented in our declaration of independence i.e. the \nnotion of a Black man being 3/5 a man) and other systems of oppression that \nare still at work in this country. Mind you, many of the systems of \noppression are not just race-based they are class based and impact several \ndifferent groups of people across this nation.\n\nC) There are more figures (past and present) who illuminate Black \nexcellence, more than figures who illuminate dysfunctional/degenerate \nbehavior. So when you say that \"If the black community wants to fix these \nissues they first need to address the fact that many black communities has \nlargely excepted a degenerate, exclusive, and ethnocentric counter culture. \nFurthermore media figures that perpetuate that counter culture are \ncelebrated while those that reject it are often referred to as Uncle Tom's \nby the much of the black community\" what are you basing this information \non. Which communities are you citing? Are you specifically talking about \nurban communities that have been stifled by generations of poverty or are \nyou talking about more affluent Black communities that exist all over the \ncountry? See, despite the conclusions that you may draw from watching \nmainstream television, Blackness is not monolithic. There are different \ntypes of Black communities -- we differ ethnically, economically, socially, \nand spiritually. However, the media's portrayal of Black people (in film, \ntv, and music) is unbalanced which is why there are several media moguls, \nwriters, directors, producers etc. working diligently to create more \ncontent that creates realistic, layered, and complex narratives of who we \nare as a diverse people. There are also skewed narratives in the teaching \nof human history. In other words, the story of Susie King Taylor, Ruby \nBridges, Daisy Bates, Ida B. Wells, Sojourner Truth, Dorothy Irene Height, \nand several others are often obscured footnotes in American History \ncourses. In result you get a double-faced conundrum: Black children are not \ntaught about the depth of their legacy/worth and other Americans are not \ngiven a story of the wealth of positive contributions Black people have \nmade (and continue to make) in this country and all over the world.\n\nD) Your understanding of the term \"uncle tom\" seems to be a bit \nmisinformed. Uncle Toms are not simply people who reject or criticize \nbad/degenerate behaviors and values. Many people who are invested in the \nbetterment of the Black community make critiques of said community, but \nthey are equally critical of societal disparities/government/policies that \nimpact disenfranchised people's pain, poverty, and pathologies. Uncle Toms \nare BLK folk who will do or say ANYTHING to stay in the good graces of an \norganization/person/group of people who have the most power in dominate \nsociety -- even if they are incorrect or if their thoughts and actions do \nnot benefit the the common good of their race. Although this particular \nterm is specific to a Black person it ultimately refers to brown-nosing. \nEvery group/culture/person may experience their version of a brown-noser \nwho will try to stay on the side of power even if it means throwing \"his \ntribe\" under the bus.\n\nE) You insinuated that I was blindly defending Brown and I am racist \nbecause of said defense... I'm not defending/opposing anyone. I am really \ntaking the stance of a humanist and questing the need to use excessive \nforce in this situation. Officers have protocol and are heavily trained. I \nbelieve that other measures could have been used by the officer to subdue \nMichael Brown. My belief does not make me racist. My belief in the \npreservation of life, the right for alleged criminals to have trail as \nopposed to being killed in the street, and the power of redemption (even \nfor criminals/alleged criminals) makes me a humanist. These values are \nrooted in my religious/spiritual upbringing.\n\nF) In closing, you are entitled to your own thoughts and opinions however \nill informed they may be... I am entitled to mine as well. Just be clear, \nI'm coming from a perspective where I do not understand the necessity of \nemptying a 9mm clip on an individual was was unarmed.

If the black community wants to fix \nthese issues they first need to address the fact that many black \ncommunities has largely excepted a degenerate, exclusive, and ethnocentric \ncounter culture. Furthermore media figures that perpetuate that counter \nculture are celebrated while those that reject it are often referred to as \nUncle Tom's by the much of the black community. Maybe after that degenerate \nand destructive counter culture has finally been wiped out and the rest of \nus are able to refer to the black community as just another community and \nAfrican Americans as just Americans we can then move on to fixing other \nproblems.

I would just \nlike to communicate with someone that has sense(which appears that you do). \nI guess my comment that I will paste for you opens dialogue that needs to \nbe had to support being ONE NATION as you stated above. I'm interested in a \nreply from you...Thanks: Corbin\n\n\n \nDon't be na\u00efve and believe that Black people are the only people to steal \nor be confrontational with cops. We never hear of a young white kid getting \nshot by cops in America. Please preserve your judgment for things you may \nhave never experienced. As a black man, I have always been a law abiding \ncitizen, with secondary education and I can tell you first hand that I have \nbeen profiled by authority. I'm not pulling the race card at all. I have \nhad more harm to me committed by a black person than white in my life. I \nhave had help in life from getting into college to having the best career \nof my life by a white person. Let's stop generalizing and understand what \nhas taken place. An 18 year old kid is dead and there is a possible \noverreaction by authority. Bottom line is when you are the authority figure \nyour decisions should be better than the public that you serve. The cop did \nnothing to protect his justification for the shooting. Cops have cameras, \nhe was actually dealing with two people so he could have slowly pursued and \ncalled for back up so he had a witness or other options. In the work force \nwhen the need for discipline is needed, authority figures always protect \nthemselves with another person as a witness. Please be open to understand \nthat Black men suffer pre judgments still today. I have to actually soften \nmy voice and soften my body language in society because I am extremely \nmuscular and bald. I'm harmless but I have to go out of my way to make \npeople comfortable from the beginning. The same as some white people have \nto present themselves as non-racist before talking with some black \npeople...Let's open dialogue on both sides without trying to hurt but still \nbe honest about social issues that still exist. I would rather you ask why \nthan assume. Most people think that every black person agrees with Al and \nJesse...shhh they both can go to hell...If Brown was guilty of theft and \nbeing an ass to a cop he deserved jail not a grave. From reading your \ncomment you appear smart enough to not generalize as much. I'm a \nconservative black man but my journey to that point didn't come without \ndealing with social inequalities of minorities. I still deal with them \ntoday...from both sides! I was called a sellout when I voted for Bush in \nhis first term because I didn't trust Gore but when I voted for Obama his \nfirst term(not his second) I was accused of doing because he was black, \nregardless of the fact that Bush's second term was weak. I'm personally \nasking you to not put anyone black or white in a box. It just hurts the \ncause of AMERICA!!!

Before he could get out \nof the car, without any warning, Brown slammed the police car door shut on \nthe officer and proceeded to assault officer Wilson through the open \ndriver's side police car window. Brown beat Wilson repeatedly in the face \nand then went for Wilson's pistol.

The officer was almost killed and was \nbeaten so brutally by Brown that he spent the next three days in the \nhospital with a crushed eye socket. It is very troubling and upsetting to \nme that the media has failed to report these facts and show how badly \nOffice Wilson was hurt.
