In a statement sent to the AAP's Kerala unit, he said he had never tried to 'intentionally hurt the sentiments of anyone'. \"It has come to my knowledge that an old video-clip of one of my Kavi-Sammelan has hurt the feelings of many of my friends residing in Kerala. I must say that I don't appreciate any discrimination based on religion, region, gender, caste or creed. I never tried to intentionally hurt the sentiments of anyone\", he stated.
