While much of Mark's work confirms the existence and continued operation of the Illuminati today, he is also dedicated to debunking conspiracy theories and hoaxes and separating the facts from the fiction; hence the \"Facts & Fiction\" subtitle for several of his books.  He has a bachelor's degree in communication from California State University.\n\nHe enjoys causing trouble for the New World Order, exposing corrupt scumbag politicians, and pointing out Big Brother's prying eyes.  The term \"fighting the New World Order\" is used by Mark to describe some of his activities, and refers to his and others' resistance and opposition (The Resistance) to the overall system of political corruption, illegal wars, elite secret societies, mainstream media, Big Brother and privacy issues; as well as various economic and social issues.  This Resistance involves self-improvement, self-sufficiency, personal responsibility and spiritual growth.\n\nBe sure to subscribe to Mark's YouTube channel, and look him up on Facebook, and Twitter.  http://www.YouTube.com/MarkDice  http://www.Facebook.com/MarkDice  http://www.Twitter.com/MarkDice  http://www.MarkDice.com", "title": "Miley Cyrus Denounces Illuminati & Vows To Help Homeless From Now On?"}, "channelId": "UCzUV5283-l5c0oKRtyenj6Q", "publishedAt": "2014-08-25T18:37:35.000Z", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "channelTitle": "Mark Dice", "categoryId": "25", "tags": ["Mark Dice", "illuminati", "conspiracy", "new world order", "secret society", "Big Brother", "Orwellian Nightmare", "Miley Cyrus (Celebrity)", "MTV Video Music Award (Award)", "Homelessness (Film Subject)", "MTV (TV Network)", "Hollywood (Neighborhood)"], "description": "Miley Cyrus Denounces Illuminati & Vows To Help Homeless From Now On?\n*SUBSCRIBE* for more great videos!  \nMark Dice is a media analyst, author, and political activist who, in an entertaining and educational way, gets people to question our celebrity obsessed culture and the role the mainstream media and elite secret societies play in shaping our lives.\n\nMark's YouTube channel has received tens of millions of views and his viral videos have been mentioned on ABC's The View, the Fox News Channel, CNN, the Drudge Report, TMZ, the New York Daily News, the New York Post, and other media outlets around the world.\n\nHe has been featured on various television shows including the History Channel's Decoded and America's Book of Secrets, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura, Secret Societies of Hollywood on E!
