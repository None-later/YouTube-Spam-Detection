What is known is that the ratings have plummeted and that shows in the same time slot on MSNBC and Fox News are far higher.\n\nShortly after the initial announcements, however, CNN broke the news that Morgan had indeed been fired from the news channel. It remains unannounced the exact date of the final episode. CNN Chief Jeff Zucker has yet to release a statement on the development. News of the show's ending was announced earlier on Sunday by the head of CNN communications, Allison Gollust.\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic to replace Larry King three years ago, it seems to come as no surprise to some that he is stepping down so soon. The former newspaper editor from London has acknowledged that his method of presenting news and commentary is not favored by Americans.\n\nOne of the main issues he has discussed and which is said to rub Americans wrong is the fundamental right to bear arms. Many say that when discussing the hot-button issue, his attitude approaches derision for those who demand to maintain their firearms. Speaking to the New York Times' David Carr, it was a topic he openly admitted has probably contributed significantly to his show's low viewership.\n\nThe animosity appears to run deep and both ways.

Others have expressed distaste for his open preference for football\u2014which Americans call \"soccer\"\u2014and cricket.

It's easy to get someone to walk the plank when they are unarmed, and Piers Morgan seems to understand that his take on guns may have been what sent many viewers to other shows.\n\nIt has been implied by USA Today that for all the discussion about Morgan's apparent gun debate with the American public, there could be another reason the show is ending. An interview in late 2013 was said by the national newspaper to be part of the investigation regarding hacking into cell phones.
