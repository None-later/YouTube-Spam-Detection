McMahon claimed that the prosecution could not prove that the babies were born alive.\n\n\"I am shocked that these counts have been dismissed,\" said Cheryl Sullenger, senior policy adviser for Operation Rescue. \"I have heard testimony by very credible witnesses to the effect that these babies were murdered in cold blood by Gosnell as they cried and struggled for life.\" \n\nTestimony in the trial so far has featured several of Gosnell's former employees, who have recounted how babies were routinely born alive during Gosnell's \"abortion\" method.
