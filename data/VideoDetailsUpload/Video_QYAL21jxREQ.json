A tall and striking blonde, Jen has battled with overzealous men approaching her since she was a teenager. An incident at a D.C. bar prompted her to use her platform as a beauty queen to speak out against street harassment, a topic that is often dismissed as just \u2018boys being boys.\u2019 But Jen and other women argue that there is something more sinister that lies beneath the motivation to aggressively cat-call or approach women in public places:  \u201cStreet harassment is almost never about sex. It's about power. Which is the same way we view rape. So saying street harassment is not a big deal is opening up the doorway for men to view women as an object to be obtained.\u201d\n\nJen herself was physically violated on the D.C. metro train in 2013 while coming home from work one night. This is her first interview about the incident.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a beauty queen to experience street harassment, a fact that we will show through a montage of stories with a variety of women. Vocativ will also give viewers a firsthand look at the experience of street harassment by strapping hidden cameras onto one of our female interviewees as she walks down a busy New York City street.\n\nhttp://voc.tv/1pAvczB\n\nIn addition to Jen Corey, Vocativ interviewed Jennifer Pozner, Executive Director for Women in Media & News, and several members of Hollaback.
