And Bill remains steadfast in his belief that FIAT currency issued BY the government is the answer to what ails us, NOT a gold-backed currency. Bill is also very fired up about Donald Trump too, saying \"He's the only chance we've got.\"   We cover it all in this dynamic, and at times bombastic conversation.
