The three suspects make their first appearance in the video at the 50 second mark.\n\n The suspects casually walk across the parking lot and hang around the recycling bin until the unsuspecting mother returns.\n\n At the 1:30 mark, the suspects notice the mother returning and move in towards her. They hold her up by gunpoint, just outside the view of the camera and demand the keys.\n\n Two members of the public, who notice the scene unfolding, make a brave attempt to block the suspects in. The suspects who remained calm and casual throughout the hijacking, point the firearm at the drivers attempting to assist, forcing them to retreat for safety reasons.\n\n The mother was thankfully not injured in anyway and the vehicle has unfortunately not yet been recovered.\n\nThank you to enforce who captured this.\nComments and opinions are welcome.\nMom Hijacked outside Kloof pre primary school\nMom hijacked outside school\n\n\nLINK : https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10152474052857850&id=365400067849&_rdr", "title": "Mom Hijacked outside Kloof pre primary school"}, "channelId": "UCUC61eap3rvVTZvuzuFcL5Q", "publishedAt": "2014-07-09T12:30:01.000Z", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "channelTitle": "Nick Botha", "categoryId": "25", "tags": ["NB", "Nick Botha", "Kloof (City/Town/Village)", "durban", "hijacking", "kloof high school", "killing", "pinetown accident", "Kloof pre primary", "school", "east cost radio", "murder", "oscar pistorius", "jacob zuma", "kloof junior primary", "south africa", "mma", "fighting", "cctv", "cctv footage"], "description": "READ ME\n**************\nCaught on a ENFORCE Security Camera, Give a LIKE for ENFORCE Security !!!\nAt 07:00 on 8 July 2014 , an unsuspecting mother was hijacked of her vehicle, outside a school in the Kloof area, KZN.\n\n The entire ordeal was caught on one of our Enforce Watchmen Camera's and the footage has been handed over to the SAPS to aid them in their investigation.\n\n At the start of the video the mother arrives, parks and sees to her child.
