The tests included tactile and heat sensitivity of the penis at the midline shaft, the area next to the midline, the glans and the foreskin. An area inside of the forearm was tested as a control.\n\nThe test results show uncircumcised and circumcised men did not differ in sensitivity at any of the penile sites and sensitivity at the forearm was lower than the other sites for both groups. In fact, the foreskin actually had similar sensitivity as the control site on the forearm.\n\n\"This study indicates that neonatal circumcision is not associated with changes in penile sensitivity and provides preliminary evidence to suggest that the foreskin is not the most sensitive part of the penis,\" lead author Jennifer Bossio, PhD candidate in Clinical Psychology of the Department of Psychology, Queen's University in Ontario told eCanadaNow. \n\nThe study also shows that sexual functioning may not differ across the circumcision status.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.
