Hassani arrived at the house after receiving a complaint about Clubb's three unleashed dogs.\n\nAccording to Hassani, a chihuahua and two other dogs were running around outside when he arrived at the scene. Hassani claimed he shot the black labrador down in self-defence. Clubb counters that the black labrador, named \"Hooch,\" was not displaying aggressive behavior and that Hassani was simply too trigger-happy.
