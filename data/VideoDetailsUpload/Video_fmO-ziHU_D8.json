The all African American female team from Towson University defeated the all African American male team from the University of Oklahoma.  Though this may be a first for African American women, it is not a real win for women or African Americans, but a loss for collegiate debate specifically and America in general.  I am not sure what the winners won, but it certainly wasn't a debate.  However, to be fair to the participants, the quality of collegiate debate began to deteriorate long before 2014.  All white teams won prior championships using a similar fast-talking style.  However from what I can tell, in the past the fast talk, what little could actually be understood, was at least related to the topic supposedly being debated.  This farce would be funny if it wasn't so sad.  However it does provide a shocking example as to why America is a nation in decline.\n   \nNOTE:  After three days and over 96K views, the owner of the YouTube channel that posted the entire 4 hour debate from which this footage was taken filed a copyright violation against this video, despite the fact that I linked to his video and helped him garner thousands of additional views.   We filed an objection claiming fair use, and about two weeks later YouTube restored the video.  Unfortunately the momentum was lost, as was the viral potential.   It really says a lot that the guy who posted the entire debate wanted to prevent people from actually seeing what he had posted!
