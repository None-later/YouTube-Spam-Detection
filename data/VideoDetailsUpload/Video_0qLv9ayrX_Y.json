In the last two years, she has undergone two breast implant surgeries -- taking her from an H to an O cup. And she has shrunk her waist from 38 to just 23 inches by squeezing herself into a tiny corset -- sometimes for up to 23 hours a day. This has resulted in\u00a0the 25-year-old's bust being TWICE the size of her waist!\u00a0Disturbingly, the corset can be so tight that when Australian-born Penny is wearing them she can only eat smaller meals -- because her stomach is so restricted. Bending, sitting and lying down can also be problematic and doing exercise or sports is completely off limits because she'd struggle to breathe properly.
