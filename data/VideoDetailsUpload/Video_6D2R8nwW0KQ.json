The shocking video -- that was recorded back in April by the way-- was released by the Daily Mail, and features the One Direction \"boy banders\" in a car with a couple of unknown pals, and as they drive, Louis mentions \"Leaving Peru, joint lit, happy days.\"\nHe then turns the camera to his band mate Zayn, and we see that a police motorcycle drives up to them as they pass the alleged joint around in the vehicle. Louis mentiones the police presence later saying: 'He's having a look. He's thinking, \"I'm sure I can smell an illegal substance in there.\" And he's hit the nail on the head'.\nLet's take another look:\nThough, Zayn starts singing about Mary J. Blige, many are assuming that he's not actually singing about her, but rather using the popular marijuana nickname -- Mary Jane. Shocker.\nThe video goes on showing them smoking and talking about weed where they cuss, laugh, and discuss their other band mates. We're not sure how The Daily Mail obtained this footage, but it's pretty obvious Louis was the one recording.\nPretty interesting stuff, but Miley Cyrus has been open about her love of weed for quite some time, so it looks like they all have something in common now?\nWhat do you think of this video?
