The difference is, Ms. Martin spoke in the context of her own talk show, to the viewers who have been tuning in for years to hear her opinions on current events, the opinions that most media did not care about until two days ago. For years Ms. Martin has been speaking out against US military intervention only to be ignored by the mainstream news outlets -- but with that one comment, branded as an act of defiance, she became an overnight sensation. It is a tempting example to follow.\n\nWhen a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional. But when someone makes a big  public show of a personal decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt.\n\nWe wish Liz the best of luck on her chosen path.\n\nFind RT America in your area: http://rt.com/where-to-watch/\nOr watch us online: http://rt.com/on-air/rt-america-air/\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/RTAmerica\nFollow us on Twitter http://twitter.com/RT_America", "title": "RT America's Liz Wahl resigns live on air"}, "channelId": "UCczrL-2b-gYK3l4yDld4XlQ", "publishedAt": "2014-03-06T00:59:47.000Z", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "channelTitle": "RT America", "categoryId": "25", "tags": ["RTAmerica", "RT America", "RTTV", "news", "politics", "breaking news", "US", "USA", "United States", "Russia", "Russian military intervention", "Ukraine", "Crimea", "Crimean Peninsula", "Liz Wahl", "live news", "on-air resignations", "official statements"], "description": "Ms. Wahl's resignation comes on the heels of her colleague Abby Martin's recent comments in which she voiced her disagreement with certain policies of the Russian government and asserted her editorial independence.
