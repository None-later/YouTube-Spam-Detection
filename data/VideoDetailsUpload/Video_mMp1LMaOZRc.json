First, why does the Benton County sheriff require a fleet of vehicles with \"mystery tags\" that have even the local cops scratching their heads?  \n\nSecond, each Chevy Silverado costs roughly $35,000, and a commercial fleet consists of at least 10 vehicles, probably more. So, overall $350,000, plus maintainence, fuel, and insurance, so lets make it the better part of half a million at an absolute minimum. All this, in some podunk county in Arkansas with less than 250,000 residents?\n\nLastly, is the county receiving a grant from Homeland Security or other federal agency? If yes, what is the purpose of that grant? Surely it can not be investigative in nature, as it is hard to imagine a vehicle that sticks out more than a big black pickup with blacked out, possibly illegal, windows. Such vehicles would tend to intimidate, rather than blend in.\n\nWere I a private investigator in Arkansas, assisting a client with a harassment case, I would imagine my job would be damn near impossible if I identified a suspect vehicle only to have the tag come back as \"untracable\".
