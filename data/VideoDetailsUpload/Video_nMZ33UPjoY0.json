Lindsey maintains she thought the cat was feral because of its bad odor, so she decided to break out her bow and arrow to deal with the trespasser. \n\nLindsey then shot the cat through the head, ending its life. Experts testified as to whether or not the cat was dead at the moment the animal doctor chose to pose for pictures with her kill. Lindsey then uploaded the photo to Facebook to show the world her skillful execution, with the caption \"My first bow kill. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it's head! Vet of the year award...gladly accepted.\"\n\nLindsey's victim was likely the missing cat of her neighbors, Claire and William Johnson. The Texas Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners compared photographs of the couple's cat with Lindsey's trophy pic, and the Johnsons testified saying it's very clear their beloved tabby cat \"Tiger\" was on the wrong end of the vet's arrow.\n\nWhy a licensed veterinarian thought committing cruelty to an innocent animal was something to brag about on social media is difficult to make sense of, and her employers felt the same way, firing her from the clinic she was working at. \n\nDuring the hearing to determine whether her license will be revoked, Lindsey said she's been unable to find anyone willing to hire her for her animal care services. Shocker. She also said had she thought the cat had an owner, she never would've killed it. Furthermore, she remarked that her use of a bow and arrow was \"efficient\" but not \"appropriate.\"\n\nA decision is expected in the weeks ahead from the State Office of Administrative Hearings as to whether Kristen Lindsey will lose her veterinary license.\n\n----------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nWelcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.
