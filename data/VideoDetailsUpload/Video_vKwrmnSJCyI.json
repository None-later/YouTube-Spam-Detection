It went into orbit this week and two days later they released a single photo. Now this photo shows some interesting detail. I decided to use an old trick I discover and take my camcorder to record it off the screen. In this way the camcorder will auto correct some of the blur in the photo. It works most the time and here it improved the photo detail about 15%. A lot of comments about the photo have mentioned the low quality of the photo, that is because India saw the structures and wanted to make it smaller so that they were not visible to the naked eye. I wonder, if India announces that they found life or at least ancient ruins on Mars, then India will go down in world history books as the discoverer of aliens. No small label by any means.
