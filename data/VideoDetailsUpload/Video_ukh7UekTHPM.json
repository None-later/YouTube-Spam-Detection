In the Republican race, Trump won all five states up for grabs: Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware. He won at least 54 percent in every state, capturing most of the delegates at stake. John Kasich placed second in four of the contests. Ted Cruz placed second in one. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Connecticut. Sanders took Rhode Island. We begin a roundtable discussion with four guests in New Mexico talking about Trump\u2019s rise to become, as he now refers to himself, \"the presumptive nominee.\" \"We have seen guns coming up from Mexico,\" says Sue Wilson Beffort, a Republican member of the New Mexico state Senate, who has not endorsed any presidential candidate but shares Trump\u2019s concerns about a \"porous\" border. \"That\u2019s all rhetoric,\" responds Diane Denish, former lieutenant governor of New Mexico, who has endorsed Clinton for president. \"We are what America is going to be in a few years: We are a minority-majority state. \u2026 And the fact that Donald Trump wants to scare people and tell them that the people that are coming are murderers and rapists, \u2026 that is just not happening.\" We also speak with former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, who is running for president as a Libertarian and was the Libertarian nominee for president in 2012. He was a Republican during his two terms as governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003. And we\u2019re joined by Jerry Ortiz y Pino, a Democratic member of the New Mexico state Senate, who has endorsed Bernie Sanders.\n\nDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs weekdays on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.
