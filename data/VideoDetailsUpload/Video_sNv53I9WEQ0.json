Brought about by a malfunction with the heating system of the Museum f\u00fcr, a Gasosaurus egg dating from the Jurassic period ended up hatching. \n\nThe egg which was believed to be petrified, was preserved in a small storage room situated right next to the boiler room. However, when the system started overheating a few weeks ago, it seems to have surprisingly initiated the incubation process, leading the egg to hatch. \n\nSince hatching, the specimen has already been transferred to the Berlin Zoo, where it can be studied in a secure environment. Gunther Warburg, paleobiologist at the museum, said: \"This is an incredible opportunity for science. The Gasosaurus is classified as a carnivorous tetanuran dinosaur of the therapod family originating from China. \n\n\n\"It remained a mystery because all we had to study upon were a few remains but now we have a live one. I feel like I'm in Jurassic Park the movie.\" A few facts have already been made public concerning the creature, including its size and weight. It is said to be 41 centimetres tall with a weight of 11 kg. \n\nEstablished in 1810, Museum f\u00fcr, is the largest museum of natural history in Germany and its mineral collections date back to the Prussian Academy of 1700. Important historic zoological specimens include those recovered by the German deep-sea Valdiva expedition, the German Southpolar Expedition and the German Sunda Expedition.\n\n- Read more at: http://gistonthis.com/germanys-museum-natural-history-scientists-hatch-first-dinosaur-egg-100m-years/", "title": "Germany's Museum of Natural History scientists hatch first dinosaur egg in 100m years"}, "channelId": "UCMDGO5RoniTDI-iAo5KL5GQ", "publishedAt": "2014-04-01T21:35:29.000Z", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "channelTitle": "nollygrio", "categoryId": "25", "tags": ["Germany's Museum", "Museum", "hatch", "dinosaur egg", "Nigerian Nollywood Movies", "free nigerian movies", "latest nigerian movies", "free nigerian movies online", "nollywood movies", "ghallywood movies", "ghana movies", "ghanaian movies", "9ja movies", "naija movies", "nigerian movies 2014", "iroko", "bunibuni", "lindaikeji", "gistonthis", "millsmusicent", "jaguda", "onlinenigeria", "ghanaweb", "africanspotlight", "lailasblog", "dencia", "african news"], "description": "- Read more at: http://gistonthis.com/germanys-museum-natural-history-scientists-hatch-first-dinosaur-egg-100m-years/\n\nSCIENTISTS at Germany's Museum of Natural History in Berlin have hatched the world's first dinosaur egg giving birth to the world's first Jurassic animal in over 100m years.
