Channel, America Declassified on the Travel Channel, the Sundance Channel's Love/Lust: Secret Societies, and is a frequent guest on Coast to Coast AM, The Alex Jones Show, and more. \n\nHe enjoys causing trouble for the New World Order, exposing corrupt scumbag politicians, and pointing out Big Brother's prying eyes.  The term \"fighting the New World Order\" is used by Mark to describe some of his activities, and refers to his and others' resistance and opposition (The Resistance) to the overall system of political corruption, illegal wars, elite secret societies, mainstream media, Big Brother and privacy issues; as well as various economic and social issues.  This Resistance involves self-improvement, self-sufficiency, personal responsibility and spiritual growth.\n\nMark Dice is the author of several popular books on secret societies and conspiracies, including The Illuminati: Facts & Fiction, Big Brother: The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, and his newest book, Illuminati in the Music Industry, which are available in paperback on Amazon.com, or e-book on Kindle, iBooks, Nook or Google Play.  While much of Mark's work confirms the existence and continued operation of the Illuminati today, he is also dedicated to debunking conspiracy theories and hoaxes and separating the facts from the fiction; hence the \"Facts & Fiction\" subtitle for several of his books.  He has a bachelor's degree in communication from California State University.\n\nBe sure to subscribe to Mark's YouTube channel, and look him up on Facebook, and Twitter.  http://www.YouTube.com/MarkDice  http://www.Facebook.com/MarkDice  http://www.Twitter.com/MarkDice  http://www.MarkDice.com", "title": "Satanic Monument Built For Oklahoma State Capitol, 7-foot-tall Baphomet Statue"}, "channelId": "UCzUV5283-l5c0oKRtyenj6Q", "publishedAt": "2014-05-01T21:03:20.000Z", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "channelTitle": "Mark Dice", "categoryId": "25", "tags": ["Mark Dice", "illuminati", "conspiracy", "new world order", "secret society", "Big Brother", "Orwellian Nightmare", "Baphomet (Named Mythical Creature)", "Monument (Visual Art Genre)", "Satanism (Religion)", "Statue", "10 Commandments", "Ten Commandments (Adapted Work)", "Satanic Temple", "Separation Of Church And State (Literature Subject)", "American Civil Liberties Union (Organization)", "Oklahoma City (City/Town/Village)"], "description": "Satanic Monument Built For Oklahoma City Capitol, 7-foot-tall Baphomet Statue\n*SUBSCRIBE* for more great videos!  \nMark Dice is a media analyst, political activist, and author who, in an entertaining and educational way, gets people to question our celebrity obsessed culture, and the role the mainstream media and elite secret societies play in shaping our lives.\n\nMark's YouTube channel has received tens of millions of views and his viral videos have been mentioned on ABC's The View, the Fox News Channel, CNN, the Drudge Report, TMZ, the New York Daily News, the New York Post, and other mainstream media outlets around the world.\n\nHe has been featured on various television shows including the History Channel's Decoded, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura, Secret Societies of Hollywood on E!
