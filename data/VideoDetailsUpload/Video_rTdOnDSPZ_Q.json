It is the first hip-hop video made by the PLA.\nPrevious PLA songs have been sung to the accompaniment of orchestral melodies, and their lyrics were carefully worded to avoid being too aggressive. By comparison, Battle Declaration, in an unmistakable effort to cater to the taste of young people, features a popular hip-hop style, and the lyrics hide neither combativeness nor a desire to fight.\nThe video starts with a young PLA soldier touching his uniform and putting on his cap. Then a man's voice comes in and says, \"There are always missions in soldiers' minds, enemies in their eyes, responsibilities on their shoulders, and passions in their hearts.\"\nThe song then continues: \"There could be a war at any time. Are you ready for that?\"\nThe video shows soldiers training and exercising, fighter jets conducting dogfights and missiles being fired, among other military activities.\nAlmost all of the PLA's best weaponry is displayed in the video, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning, J-11 fighter jet, Type-99A tank and DF-11 ballistic missile.\nSatellites and spacecraft also appear in the video, which indicates the PLA has placed unprecedented importance on its space force, said a PLA publicity expert who asked to be identified only as Jiao.\nMoreover, the appearance of the military's space assets also intends to impress upon viewers that \"the PLA is no longer the poorly equipped one that they saw from TV dramas, but a powerful force as modernized as the United States military,\" he told China Daily.\nJiao said the hip-hop video could be a big help in recruiting young people.\nThe PLA is striving to recruit more educated young people.
