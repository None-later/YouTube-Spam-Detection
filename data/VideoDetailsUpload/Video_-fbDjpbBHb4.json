This feeling especially grew after the second war with Lebanon, when I was a kid and I was at a friend's house in Nazareth. My mother left me there and went to work, and rockets from Lebanon hit the city which is the largest Arab city in Israel.\nTwo innocent children were killed by the rockets, Israeli Arab children, and I remember how scared I was as you could hear and feel when the rockets hit the ground and people were full of dust from when the rockets hit. And when I remember these things I feel how important it is that we feel connected to Israel. When somebody wants to destroy this country it means that somebody wants to destroy and kill us - all of us. No matter if you are Jewish, or Arab we are Israelis and to them we are their enemies.
