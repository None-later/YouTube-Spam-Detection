I think I should point out that her \nDrax-fight wasn't necessarily a \"rescue\" scenario, but the 2? ship fighting \nrescues... I'll count.  Still, if we see her kick ass in the sequal, all is \nforgiven.  That's the only thing that really missed.\n\nre:  Drax  - I completely disagree.  He can't act, and that was played up \nas he's an alien and doesn't get it.  It was both meta and deadpan.  Is he \nthe Rock?  No.  But the Rock isn't even the Rock most of the time.

He is the breakout character here.\n\nRe:  Groot - I admit his acting was a bit... weird.  But I didn't hate him. \n He was so close to being annoying and yet never went over the edge.

While universal translators \nOBVIOUSLY exist, the movie went to lengths to explain how mannerisms don't \ntranslate.

It really was a great as I expected, but I admit the 2 \nafter credit scenes weren't enough.  If they had a Nebula scene with her on \nthe ship reporting the Thanos, it would have been great.\n\nFinally, I loved this movie.  I would seriously go back and look at Gunn's \nother work because of this.\n\nEnd of the day, this movie felt a little SMALL, but many people are \ncomparing it favorably to the original Star Wars and I largely agree.

In Avengers Loki locks up when Thanos's \nmouth piece reminds him of Thano's power. Ronan, a total jerk that had 0 \ncompunction at attacking someone, backed off once Thanos faced him. These \nguys (Loki, Ronan) take a whole crew of heroes to take down... a mere \nthought of Thanos taking action against them shut them down.\n\nLast thoughts: Seems you wanted a more 'serious/angsty' movie. The trailers \ndid not present the movie in this vain and I enjoyed what was presented as \nit was presented. Could it have been better? Yes, Gamora is one sore spot \nfor me and the attempt at romance had me shaking my head, as well as a few \nother points.

I watch a ton of anime most \nof it in Japanese(which is why in your Godzilla review your \nmispronunciation of Ken Watanabe's name bothered me so much) and because of \nthat when I listen to voice action I listen for the emotion of the \nperformance, this language barrier has helped me more strongly appreciate \nvoice acting and I already loved it to begin with and I could hear Vin \nDiesel's voice coming from Groot and that isn't a bad thing because I still \nsaw Groot as a character before I thought of Vin Diesel.\n\nIt is the same thing though to a lesser extent with Thanos, he had the \nright amount of intimidation and calmness in his voice, and as a character \nhe was quite foreboding, Ronan betrayed him and had an Infinity Stone and \nsaid he was his next target and Thanos didn't seem to care, he is so \nconfident in his power that he doesn't see Ronan as a threat even with the \nstone, this shows great insight into why he is the big bad, he sees the \npower to destroy a planet in his enemies hands and he just doesn't care, \nand even at the end of the Avengers when his emissary tells him that going \nagainst Earth is like courting death he simply smiles and if we take it as \ncourting the Marvel interpretation of Death(as in the character) it makes \nit even more terrifying because he has been unable to woo her so it could \nbe seen as him smiling at an impossible task.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z122gbeg1ynseparh04cenwrlta4ehuqm50": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfbstTBJcJphHCG5U8EMIQA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-psiV9IjTYCE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/gEV8zsGxQ6c/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "soulstealer29a", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-01T22:43:59.458Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfbstTBJcJphHCG5U8EMIQA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.57094, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-01T22:43:59.458Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116561162582589767161", "textDisplay": "Wow.

Now that we've got it out of the way, let's move on to your review \nof +Guardians of the Galaxy. I completely disagree with your read on the \nmovie. I am an avid DC Comic Book Reader and NEW to the Marvel Universe. \nOver the last year, as the Marvel franchises have been building up, I'd \nbegun reading a lot of the X-Men & Avengers series'. For the most part, my \nenjoyment or lack thereof has mirrored yours when reviewing these movies. I \nfully understand the position you took with some of the character \ndevelopment. We can all agree, when making a movie which includes so many \ncharacters with an existing expanded universe, it's going to a challenge \nfor the any director/story teller. Personally, Considering the plot line \nand time allotted, Gunn set it up about as well as you can. I believe the \ncomic book fan in all of us should accept movie incarnations as being \nslightly different from original source material. It's near impossible for \nthe adaptations to mirror one another. Marvel is obviously trying to tie \nall of the movies together into it's own split storyline & expanded \nuniverse. Ultimately, at the end of the day, I think as hard-core comic \nbook fans we should be open to the limitations these movies may have. Enjoy \nthe movies for what they are, without constantly comparing it to the source \nmaterial. I've never read a Guardians Comic Book, but did research the \norigin stories prior to going to the screening. Look, it was't perfect (The \nCollector character had so much potential & Howard the Duck's cameo was \ncompletely lame)...Still, it was a fun ride and left me wanting more. Like \nI said Grace, this is the first time I've disagreed with you on a movie. \nYou're still the best in the business and I look forward to the next \ninstallment of BYT! :-)\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12yuddheufbdrp1522vg5fqamzrutwcm": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEnPY6anK7q6_Fz3iZG2V1g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7qzmmjEstcs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/h7bY5LkKDn0/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Groot The Tree", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-03T01:02:12.148Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCEnPY6anK7q6_Fz3iZG2V1g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99999998196009998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T01:02:12.148Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105785719304495538493", "textDisplay": "I am Groot.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z132wjigaorvhhf4104chfwzus3hshqiek00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 3, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXLIgZGIititZ6z3q2lMUNQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1WHwda8IKy4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABQ/qfEhVkTUc7g/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "AvatarIII", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T23:38:27.907Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCXLIgZGIititZ6z3q2lMUNQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.29550399999999999, "formal_score": 17, "updatedAt": "2014-08-05T14:08:00.000Z", "likeCount": 16, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110616860089030754529", "textDisplay": "In regards to Karen Gillan's voice, she did change it.

Rocket walking around with his groot plant at the end was \nadorable, and I thought he was very well developed in the time frame. \nThe other part I agree with is Thanos. LAME. As soon as he spoke I was \ndisappointed, the voice acting didn't fit the character at all. Ronan \nsounded like a total BA and then thanos was just eh. Also, the most \ndangerous man in the galaxy just totally let Ronan betray him. The only \nthing he did was angrily sign off when they were talking. Seriously?! No \nrepercussions? If that's how he deals with enemies I think the galaxy has \nfew things to worry about lol.\n\nOnto the things I disagree with: I thought Dave Batista did a great job, \nespecially for not being a professional actor. I enjoyed his character, and \na lot of his lines. I also think Chris Pratt did a great job with starlord, \nand I felt he was well established. Him saving Gamora showed his softer \nside, and I liked his sense of humor. \n\nAll in all I think this was way better than the Thor movies, and therefore \na good job on marvels part. I would see a sequel, though I would be even \nhappier with a rocket and groot spin off.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zx1yzjvqei14v022exlb4os3uvz3s4": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrxYvmavQQ1gU0OBcT70NNA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2PL7eFhtV-w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADss/hhWr5LuoWig/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Alex FC", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-04T19:41:43.940Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrxYvmavQQ1gU0OBcT70NNA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.86801609999999996, "formal_score": 6, "updatedAt": "2014-08-04T19:46:43.000Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101966908634826522273", "textDisplay": "you totally saw a different movie\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ejhk53ou2zxycx220hhlzovils1md5": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8_yxm91HgY1CH3Sz-ThIqg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Zach Pacheco", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-03T08:11:48.031Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC8_yxm91HgY1CH3Sz-ThIqg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.72756799999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T08:11:48.031Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113514718198619615837", "textDisplay": "i loved this movie so much :(\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13syldxxwrgybrw204cgdipurykdvzg2pg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaVgM8juLLtZ3zpllwthCFA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KtOsewD-wLE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB0/B7KFRpO90Bc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 1.4234875444839858, "authorDisplayName": "Criticismguy2009", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T08:08:57.305Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaVgM8juLLtZ3zpllwthCFA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.17134000000000005, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T08:08:57.305Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103091553504087870999", "textDisplay": "Hahah wow Grace you really must of pissed a lot of movie giers and hardcore \nfans of this Marvel franchise off to have 825 people dislike tgis movie \nreview video over 418 people liking it and agreeing with you.Anywatmys i \nhaven't seen the film myself and don't intend on going iut to see it .I'll \njust wait for another 6-8 monyhs when its finally released on Blu-Ray/dvd \ninstead and make my own judgemental opinions of it myself! =PAside from \nthat grace if i had to go see the film .Id only see it fir tge nice ass and \nboobs and tits shots they ahow of Zoe Saldana's sexy hot body even though \nshes an alien in the film she still looks fine and sexy as hell to me since \nim a guy!=D\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12zdzuxztizubxe423xwlxaatmexpyfg": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH3lmReD6JAJdQP1k_C2aqw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Paul Branon", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T02:16:00.658Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCH3lmReD6JAJdQP1k_C2aqw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.04293199999999997, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T02:16:00.658Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109477760729673822016", "textDisplay": "Guardians of the galaxy was the best marvel movie I've ever seen.

I went into this movie with pretty low \nexpectations. Ready to shit on it, as you are now. But, to my surprise, it \nwas a very entertaining movie. First off, I'm on the Chris Pratt train now. \nMajor Kudos to him. The entire cast did a good job. Bautista isn't getting \nnominated for anything but he wasn't horrible. I get that for an ensemble \nmovie, character backstory was rushed a bit but they touched on the points \nthat made you understand the characters. I felt for all of them.Enough to \nwant a sequel. Now I never read a GOFG comic or knew anything about them \nbefore seeing this movie, but I saw it with people who did and they loved \nit too. Besides the usual \"well they didn't put this or they didn't put \nthat from the comic\" convo that you get from bibliophiles, they were \nnowhere near as harsh. They want a sequel too. AND I cannot believe you \ndidn't like the soundtrack. Maybe it's because I connected with them cause \nthose are also the songs my mother shared with me growing up, but they \nreally helped set the mood.

I love you woman, but I definitely do not agree with you on this \none on your overall feeling about it. Lower your expectations?!? I thought \nthis movie was AWESOME!!! Let me start this comment with the fact that I \nLOVED the old 90s show Farscape. From watching your reviews and videos over \nthe years I'm almost certain that you've never seen the show. The entire 4 \nseasons are on Netflix though if you'd like to check out the first few \nepisodes of it. If you do it's a bit slow at first till John Crichton goes \nthrough the wormhole and thrown onto the alien ship, Moya. I mention that \nshow because the moment I saw the trailer for this film back when they \nfirst released it that show is IMMEDIATELY what came to mind for me while \nwatching it. Those of you who have seen the show will understand why and \nprobably agree about loving this film if you loved that show too. They have \na similar feel to each other. I wouldn't be surprised if James Gunn and the \nwriters of GotG were big fans of the show as well.\n I admit, I can agree with some of the things you said about GotG, Grace. \nLike that it kinda has a more 90s feel to it (which I loved). And about the \nneed for a universal translator on them all. Which going back to the \nFarscape reference they handled quick and easy in the first episode once he \nwas on the alien craft and could have done something similar here. That Zoe \nSaldana wasn't very good acting wise, but then she never really is. She's \nlike a younger version of Halle Berry. She's a pretty face and a just \nenough 'token ethnic' for the studio heads to shove her into everything \nthey want someone with a 'little more ethnic look'. But Zoe's not really \nsome great oscar worthy actress or anything. And neither is Halle Berry.\n Dave Batista I thought did an EXCELLENT job as his part. He was playing a \nguy (at least here) that was suppose to be more wooden and literal. Since, \nlike Rocket said, his people take everything literally. Maybe he's not like \nthat in the comics, which I've never read any of the comics with him in \nthem, but that's the impression I got of the character here.\n  I too wish they had done more with Nebula. I thought Karen Gillan looked \nF**KING AWESOME in her look for the character (again no idea about her in \nthe comics). They didn't use her enough in the film to flesh her out and \nshow how bad ass she apparently is. But she looked amazing as her that's \nfor sure. Maybe it's just because I love redheads and loved her as Amy Pond \nin Doctor Who. But hell I'd cosplay as Nebula myself. She looked AWESOME! \nBlue chicks are hot :p. Farscape fans will agree with me on that one too ;).\n I would have liked a bit more about the Kree Empire too.They gave little \nimpression as to just how badass the Kree are other then just Ronin. They \nare suppose to be pretty widespread and a dominant empire in the galaxy, \nright? Along side the Shi'ar  and the Skrull, the other dominant empires in \nthe galaxy.\n I think you, Grace, have a couple of issues with a film like this going \ninto it. One you are HUGE into comics as well as films. So you go into it \nwith all this knowledge of the characters in the comics and everything \nabout the storylines surrounding it so when it's not what you feel it \nshould be you tend to already want to down grade it in the back of your \nmind. And that it doesn't fully explain things you feel needed to be more \nin-depth about that the rest of us aren't that concerned with. (I will also \nadmit that I would have liked if they had said what each 'stone' was and \nwhich one it was that they had there. Which I'm guessing it was the Soul \ngem.) I know you also are not really that into Sci-fi stuff. So that's \nanother 'meh' reason against it in your eyes. Not to mention the fact that \nyou tend to worry a bit much sometimes about 'oscar worthy performances' \nfrom every movie you see. Perhaps I'm being a little to judgmental on these \npoints about you though. Except for the sci-fi thing. You know you don't \nreally care for sci-fi stuff. Go on, admit it :p.\n I did think the after credits sequence was completely throw away and \nstupid with Howard the Duck. They could have had The Collector finding his \nother gem that he was given in Thor: The Dark World in the rubble to remind \nus that he already had one of them beforehand. And/or show him talking to \nsomeone else connected to them about it if he even has some other purpose \nfor them then just collecting them for himself. Like maybe Adam Warlock in \nPhase3 of Marvel's films? Hmm? Maybe... hopefully. Magics, space, other \ndimensions, Thanos & the Infinity Gems, Great place to have put him or \neluded to him since he's connected to all that. \n So while I can agree with you on some of your points I can't agree with \nyou on your overall stance on the film. This movie was fun. VERY fun! And \nyes there were a few bits and pieces that where out of place here and \nthere. But overall it was a DAMN great time! And one hell of an addition to \nthe Marvel cinematic universe. One that I look forward to revisiting \nwhenever they do go back to it. :)\n(And forgive me if I went on a bit to long or if I rambled a bit. I have a \ntendency to do that.)\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13jgvaoyzu2hxder22xcrtxcyjzdxh3o": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCudT2EXUyi1UIES7JWtx5aQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JsxAp_6rQuE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/EB1CTi0UDOw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "cattledogandstaffy", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-27T22:47:31.367Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCudT2EXUyi1UIES7JWtx5aQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.94352029999999998, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-12-27T22:47:31.367Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115236387990939380805", "textDisplay": "I'm so glad you loved Rocket and Groot!! <3 They're my favourites and I was \nworried you wouldn't like them :3\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ahvnhrlnnyd1cb22cezchckydy5mbj04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ0NlRUUTS4PZKnatWkCErQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZcRJb22exJw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/2tdp-4yzWFQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "The Big Guy", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-05T21:31:41.165Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZ0NlRUUTS4PZKnatWkCErQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99557983999999999, "formal_score": 70, "updatedAt": "2014-09-05T21:31:41.165Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/111543186361882256224", "textDisplay": "best movie na\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13kitjozwfjedenk234uvswnnzdgtjdu": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgcw3uAurAcGT5SpmzMZu6Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 6.666666666666667, "authorDisplayName": "Aaron Jones", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-12-01T17:23:19.752Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCgcw3uAurAcGT5SpmzMZu6Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99315162000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-12-01T17:23:19.752Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110417499536200192834", "textDisplay": "WRONG WRONG WRONG, this movie is fucking great.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13dfdppazjgg5tbs04cg5bxhzurtrmoy5k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfKK65t5J8iKRtjIVjeN1GA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "SpectatingBystander", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-04T09:39:04.538Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCfKK65t5J8iKRtjIVjeN1GA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.7878400000000001, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-08-04T09:39:04.538Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/113823469466462460131", "textDisplay": "Sounds like marvel have dropped the ball big time.

Otherwise they drink their own KoolAde (due to \nglowing reviews from reviewers who haven't read a comic since Archie in \ngrade school) the way Raimi did with the original Spiderman movies, and the \nseries will go down hill.

Try \nto criticize GRR Martin in a book review on Amazon and you get the same \nthing! GR is a thoughtful critic who is deeply involved with what she \nwatches (she is actually a FAN, not a reviewer who doesn't have a clue and \njust follows the crowd), unlike the many, many \"critics\" out there who just \nmouth what audiences want to hear so they can get readers and viewers.

Your right in that \nit wasn't on par with Winter Soilder. But it wasn't trying to be that. It \nwas a film for fun, also to set up the world Thanos exists in. Its a \ntypical summer flick, didn't take it self to seriously and willing to have \nfun. \n\nWith Gamora I agree with you, I would have loved to see her as more badass. \nI wanted her to be shown to have the upper hand in nearly all situations. \n\nBatista's stuff was pretty weak, after his first series of lines I got over \nit but, his power level made him seem barely worth keeping on the team.\n\nYes, underwhelmed with Thanos, and yes to his voice, its like how is Thanos \nfrom texas? Have him standing. Have him reading some enormous screen. Have \nhim standing over a planet as he kills it. I don't know, is he just playing \nthe long con with death? Waiting until he's got everything just right \nbefore he makes his move on her? Show him murder some great number of \npeople or in a room sacrificing people continually as an ever greater gift \nto death. Even better, show Death reluctantly spending time with Thanos per \nhis enormous gift. Begin to build his frustrated love story, and after a \nfew minutes of that show him command and enormous fleet to kill something \nyet bigger. Then do that scene with Ronan.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it. I'd watch another. I don't mine Jame Gunn's style \nand take on the content. I enjoyed the tone Winter Solider had, I \nappreciated what it took on as far as the Government overreach, but not \nevery movie needs to get that serious.\n\nI think this will be one of the most successful marvel movies outside of \nIronMan and Avengers because it is so generally appealing.

Also, I agree the villain \nRonan looks pretty bad-ass but ultimately, I don't like him.

He was nothing more than a spectator for the \nfinal battle scene and does nothing much to impress the audience. It's \nlike, will you just kill Drax already?

Disagree with quill n gamora \nthought they were acted really well. When i think back cud i imagine \nsomeone else as Quill the answer is not really n thats credit to how much \nhe owned it. perhaps ur problem was more with the lines or script? Altho \nagree gamora did need to be more combat proficient given her tru skill leve \nin mcu. Cooper voiced rocket well n no complaints bout him. Drax was better \nthan I thought he wud be, was kinda funny in a really dry way. But he \nsuffered from lack of time/back story/connection as well. Groot was well \ndone all round. I think most of the issues came from not enuf screen time \nfor all the setup's. however overall the tone of the movie was great, it \nwas fun and upbeat. With a surprising amount of heart.

That aside, I don't know about mercury from the comics, and \nit may be bias from my love for the actress herself, but the character was \nreally interesting to me, and unlike Thanos held an air of mystery to her. \nWhich was wonderful.\nI didn't really think her anger was manufactured...\nThe Nova core were pretty much just there, I'll grant you that. They did \nprovide use at the end to some extent though, don't you lie. They were \npretty sweet at the end.\nThere was a lot of death, and it was pretty neat. No, it wasn't a did that \nguy just die? It was a HOLY SHIT THAT GUY...no....no guys...no.\nThe Ravengers were the hillbillies of the movie. I don't think they needed \nto discuss it at the beginning of the movie. I really don't. And you'd be \nsurprised how many are demanding a sequel. Probably not after reading your \ncomment section, but still.\nThe collector...literally did not need to be in there. His only purpose was \nexplanation...so yeah...I'll give ya that one.\nThat end credit sequence was such a troll. I laughed so loud at the end.\nIt's not a tough sell beyond hardcore fans. I had a friend who dissed the \nmovie as fantastic four and a half up until she saw it, came out of it \nloving the movie. She really dislikes super hero movies, but loved this \nfilm. If that tells ya something about the film.\nThat duck...was stupidly strange?\nWhat...are you talking about with professionalism? They had plenty in \nvisuals alone. Did you even listen to yourself? Marvel studios started out \nwith people who broke away from big studios and started from the ground \nup...\nI personally enjoyed it greatly, though there were a couple of moments \nwhere I was channeling my inner cinemasins and going: Nope...no you should \nbe dead. I don't care if you're enhanced or what not. You're in \nspace...exposed...you should be dead.\n\nOn the not of death...I really didn't mind it. It drove home a darkness to \nthis humor. And...to be frank...this movie was never portrayed to me as \nsomething you'd want to bring your young kids too. Though the one's in the \ntheater with me were laughing at deaths...which is a whole other basket of \napple's I'll leave on the floor for later.\nI'm going to end my little rant/counter/debate/thing here for now.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12dvfiolo3qcfsf2223ur4ocqjqgva4d04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC1GbIxwjNrFsjqhV1-CRhA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.68027210884353739, "authorDisplayName": "redhotchilifan98", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-05T06:58:57.498Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCC1GbIxwjNrFsjqhV1-CRhA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.50940199999999991, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-05T06:58:57.498Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103714724104842592765", "textDisplay": "cannot believe she didn't like this movie she is stupid as hell this was \nwell directed I actually cared about the characters and it had suprising \nemotional depth the acting was good as well to compare this to thor the \ndark world is absolutely stupid I think this is one of marvels better \nmovies in a long time a movie where people can get attached to new \ncharacters what a horrible review\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z134vlh4una4t3jby04cdpm5oorqgh0peso0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyF7cXeXhRuULbgUj8HGflA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jNFhMYBmNTk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/oHUELmhGQis/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Afrowill", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T06:09:45.901Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCyF7cXeXhRuULbgUj8HGflA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.038745999999999947, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T06:09:45.901Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107996333071727055997", "textDisplay": "I liked the movie I feel like your being hard on it.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z125szfyqm2ocr2io04cjvv4atn2e14qwlc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaSoSN5lhvmIHUnGjkdw9UQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MovieMan47", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T13:45:35.122Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaSoSN5lhvmIHUnGjkdw9UQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.37382200000000004, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T13:45:35.122Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115295149307054774786", "textDisplay": "I stopped watching this at lower your expectations.

Opinions get \nlost in the sea of comments and I doubt Grace will get to see this.\n\nAs a foreword I enjoy Beyond the Trailer and like Grace opinion. While I \nthink it's off a tinge because she puts too much industry thought behind \nher feelings, but that is how she attacks it. Reviews are entirely \nsubjective, even while some may think they're supposed to be objective.\n\nAnother bit of information about myself that I'd like to share is that I'm \nnot a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I feel the business model works \nas that, a business model. Most movies feel middling and purely exist to \nmake money and for set up. There are some notable stand outs that I feel \nare movies in their own right and are damn right good to boot(Avengers, Cap \n1 and 2 and thankfully Guardians.\n\nGuardians is the breath of fresh air I think the Marvel cinematic universe \nneeds. Fresh characters and a feel all its own. Yes, it takes place in the \nMarvel Cinematic Universe, but it never feels like that is a fault to it. \nIt doesn't obey the same rules, or adhere to the same look, or directing \nstyle...like with Avengers, you can feel the director getting to do what he \nwants to do, which can't be said about the majority of the other films.\n\nAs far as point by point dislikes of the film go, I had a few:\n\n*Gamora does feel like the weakest character of the Guardians, but not \nparticularly a bad one. Her role doesn't feel completely perfunctory like \nthe likes of Black Widow or Hawkeye. The movie can't work without Gamora, \nshe brings something to the team.\n\n*Ronin and Nebula are the weakest characters in the film, both in terms of \ncharacter and acting. I mean, but is it worth complaining about this now? \nAs if Marvel already hasn't had this problem in the past? OUtside of Loki \n(and MAYBE Red Skull) are any other villains in the Marvel Cinematic \nUniverse good? They're all secondary factors in the plot and just around to \nbe beaten by the good guys at the end. At least Ronin earned a laugh or two \nwhich is more than I can say about Killian or Malakite.\n\n*The Action.  It's okay, but it isn't great. James Gunn's hand to hand \nfights aren't as great as some other Marvel films, but it does its job. The \ncharacters are strong enough to have you invested in their fates regardless \nof how amazing the action scenes are. In the end I still cared who won and \nlost, which isn't the same that can be said about films with arguably \nbetter action scenes(Transformers films, Thor The Dark World, etc)\n\n\nThe shot you took at Dave Bautista is odd to me...I think you might not \nhave gotten what he was doing with the character. His comedic timing was \nexcellent and I think he might actually be the funniest character in the \nfilm. He is the break out role imo...everyone knew the rest of the all star \ncast was going to deliver, he was the one X-factor and I'm happy to say he \nmade Drax one of my favorite characters.\n\nI don't think the movie was that confusing for the uninitiated. I went with \nmy girlfriend and a ton of friends who don't read comics or know much lore \nconcerning Thanos and that didn't affect their viewing. Would it be \nenriched by outside knowledge, sure, but that is the problem with expanded \nuniverses...and why I got out of reading mainstream comics...you shouldn't \nhave to read every limited or ongoing to enjoy the work. They do not inform \nthe works, but merely enhance them-that's how I see it.\n\nThat 'professionalism' you're talking about might be more akin to 'death of \nthe author'. Should creators put aside their artistic integrity to create \nmore assembly line middling films so that everything seems more uniform and \n'professional'?  I'd much rather see really good movies individually than \nworry about the promise of something greater to come and have to watch a \nton of vanilla films.  \nEdgar Wright has already left, and from what Guardians and Avengers showed \nme is that a creator with a vision is an asset to this cinematic universe.\n\nThose are my thoughts.\nNormally I'm a naysayer and usually arguing against people mindlessly \npraising these Marvel movies, but with this movie I'm a believer.

I don't understand why you feel the \ncharacters didn't get enough attention?.They had loads of screen time and \nwere given plenty of time to shine. \n\nStar Lord could've opened the packaging from his mother earlier but it \nworks so well at the end because he opens it up at time in his life when it \nwas the perfect time for him mentally. \n\nYou don't need to have read the comics to understand this movie, I never \nread the comics and fell into this world they created very quickly. its one \nof the most easily accessible films i've seen for the genre and content its \ndealing with. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnp-d0P453JDpnPgpVTJmkw", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Laserclops", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xijoa1pnayd0mg22gtb0h4vvah3wj104", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-24T16:24:42.764Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCnp-d0P453JDpnPgpVTJmkw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.85836230000000002, "formal_score": 50, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-24T16:24:42.764Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-R07qz1M9V4I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJE/-2uDEAZQa40/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/114401445592959942184", "textDisplay": "+ReFoCuZ Agreed"}}, {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Ws4VIvfy9HH95crlOJyPA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Acceptant", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13xijoa1pnayd0mg22gtb0h4vvah3wj104", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-10-24T16:23:17.889Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC2Ws4VIvfy9HH95crlOJyPA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.999261548, "formal_score": 15, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-10-24T16:23:17.889Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hUroQPFDhFI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAS0/k9H7uTDvqvc/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112754919418517328272", "textDisplay": "The movie was ok............

That did bothered me a lot.\n\nI also agree that Ronan was not a memorable villain, i think they could \nhave done a better job on explaining his motive. But that has been their \nproblem from the start.\n\nI also agree that the guy that played Drax is not the best actor ever, but \nhe was not terrible either, it did bother me when he first appeared but it \nwas something I got used to real quick.\n\nWe all knew (by we i mean me and I'm assuming others did too might be \nwrong) that Thanos is just the mastermind of everything that is going on in \nthe Marvel cinematic universe so he shouldn't be taking too much screen \ntime or focus away from the other characters. He is good as a guy in a \nchair for now.\n\nNebula was just there if she was removed from the movie nothing would \nchange, but her being there doesn't really hurt the movie either.\n\nOverall i would give this movie 8/10 because the movie knew what it was, it \nwas a movie based on a comic book that is not one of the big ones like the \nAvengers or X-Men. It's a movie who has a talking tree and a raccoon as one \nof the main characters you really cant take it that serious.

I'm responding on Grace because hers seems to be \nthe most thought out ones I've seen so far.  I have to agree that until the \nnumbers are in and the 2nd week box office comes around, it's impossible to \ndetermine audience response just from a personal opinion of the film.   \nHere's the parts I disagreed with.  I think the characters got enough \nscreen time, and the movie did not feel crowded at all.  As to the issue of \nGamora having to be saved, I agree with the first part to a point but the \nsecond save (and there were only two so-called \"saves\" in the movie, so I \ndon't get the \"she had to be saved a lot\" thing.)  The first one I thought \nthat she was restraining herself because she was trying to make a point and \nI feel that it's the actor's and director's fault for not actually \nconveying this strongly enough.  Otherwise I was baffled why she would have \neven let these other prisoners grab her.  For instance if after the Peter \n\"saves\" her scene if she proceeded to take everyone out in under a second \nand just gave a \"hey, I was trying to make a point that I had changed, I \ndidn't really need you to step in\" look on her face with Quill looking on \nand feeling a little like a idiot.  It would have been in line with the \nfeel of the film and made the point I believe they were trying to make.  \nHer second save?  Grace, seriously?  She was in space and even with her \nenhancements she was dying.  Whose butt was she supposed to kick after \nbeing ejected from her ship?  Dark Matters?  Solar Flares?   I think the \npoint of the scene was for Peter so show there was more to him, and I think \nit was done effectively.   I do agree that I wish there was more Thanos or \nhe did more, but I think Marvel has a plan and I'm going with it since \neveryone has been wrong about it every time they announce a movie.  The \nrest of the review I believe was as fair as you could get for not liking \nthe film pretty much at all as you did.  I don't agree with a lot of your \nreview, but as I said, I can see and understand where these complaints are \ncoming  from.  It just hit me in the opposite way.  I loved the movie.

The \nreveal of the tape at the end was the perfect place for it.\nThere was no romantic relationship between Gamora and Starlord. It was just \nPeter flirting with all the girls he comes across.\nThe character's name is just Rocket.\nThanos just doesn't care about what's happening in this plot. He's just \nkind of amused.\nNebula was awesome. I just don't get your criticisms.\nShe was angry because Thanos called Gamora his favorite daughter.\nThis movie isn't aimed at families or adults or any particular age group. \nIt just is what it is. Again this is you trying to force this movie into a \nbox.\nA 90's space epic is cutting edge in an era of overly formulaic \ncookie-cutter hero films.\nThis movie sets up infinite possibilities. And opens up the marvel \ncinematic universe to go wherever it wants in the future.\nIt was complex. And hugely successful at representing so much information \nin only two hours time.\nI basically disagree with everything you've said during this review.

This role didn''t require a lot of \nemotion. Bautista is to Drax as Arnold is to the Terminator, so I thought \nthe casting was apt.\n* agree that Thanos and Ronan were underwhelming\n*I disagree about Nebula. I thought her relationships with Gamora and \nThanos were interesting. I think one reason why you might have liked Karen \nGillan in the role was because she did not convey a whole lot of emotions \nor use a lot of acting muscles, but I think that was a conscious decision \nsince she was like a cyborg. I thought the scene where Thanos calls Gamora \nhis favorite daughter and Nebula has a very slight reaction as if she was \nsomewhat hurt by that comment was a nice nuance.\n* I completely agree with you about the end credits-scene. THAT WAS THE \nWORST OF THE MARVEL STUDIOS END CREDITS SCENES. I want them to respect the \nfans more. The very last scenes for Thor TDW and Captain America TWS were \nnot that great, either. I really hope they know where they're going.\n\nThat being said, I really liked the film overall. I thought the Guardians \nall worked even if they could've been better. The movie had some really \ngreat one-liners. Some good action sequences. I liked the retro soundtrack \nset to space-age visuals.

Now as far as the film goes I'll follow the \nformula in your review and start with Peter Quill. I'm not all that \nfamiliar with the comics, but I felt the movie did a great job of \nestablishing the connections Peter had with his mother and the mix tape, \nbut I do agree with you that it would have made more of an impression if we \nhad heard his mother call him Star Lord during the flashback or even within \nflashback. I understand why it wasn't until the end of the movie that he \nhad opened the present because I feel that by opening it Peter, in a way, \nwas letting go of the only family he had so it makes sense to me that when \nhe accepted the trust of his friends he was finally able to let go. Overall \nI felt that Chris Pratt worked very well in this role because he has this \nnice quirky presence about him which adds a level to Quills character. I \nunderstand your points on how Gamora was written and I agree they should \nhave given her more breakout moments of being a supreme assassin, but I \nalso feel that the movie was taking place during a time where she was done \nwith seeing people die so I feel we saw a Gamora that tried to avoid \nconflict, but I will agree that she should have been able to save herself \nin the prison and it would have been nice to see her and Drax have a little \nmore conflict. I'll say based off Zoe Saldana's performance of Gamora that \nshe did a great job of portraying the character and the interesting dynamic \nI felt she added was that Gamora is more of a sister to Peter than a love \ninterest and Zoe conveyed that really well to me. Now Drax was an \ninteresting character that had many levels and I feel that Dave Bautista \ndid really well with the role and lines he was given. What I gathered from \nDave's performance was that Drax is an emotionally destroyed man who takes \neverything as serious and literal which I felt was done well and I can't \nremember the exact line, but when the Guardians are in the guard tower Drax \nhas a line that almost sounds like something from Shakespeare. I really \nthink that Dave took Drax and made it his own, but like I said before I \nwould have liked to see more of a transition with Drax trusting Gamora and \nthe others. As for Rocket and Groot I really liked them both! I fully agree \nwith you on Thanos that his reveal should have been made more ominous and \nforeboding, but instead it was just a casual turn of the chair and he just \ndidn't feel like a mastermind so I hope he gets a lot more fleshed out in \nthe sequel. I really liked Ronan as the main villain because he struck me \nas a cross between Darth Vader and Darth Maul, but I don't think they \nshould have killed him off because he had a lot of villain potential. A \nvillain I was really looking forward to was Nebula for two main reasons, 1. \nShe had a really cool and interesting makeup design and 2. I was familiar \nwith the actress that plays her. I really liked Nebula because she is now \nthe first female villain of the cinematic universe and has potential to be \nthe next big bad of the marvel movies, by this I mean she would be second \nto Loki. Nebula's main problem I think was that her origin story and what \nThanos had done to her were glazed over. I feel that if they gave \nindividual attention to either Ronan or Nebula we would have a great \nfleshed out villain in the cinematic universe. As for Karen Gillan's \nportrayal I liked it cause she was playing that angry second in command \nthat wants to be in control and I liked how her accent came through because \nfor some reason villains that have an accent tend to stick with me more, \nbut I agree that Nebula and Ronan both could have been fleshed out a little \nmore. With Yondu I agree that he should have addressed that he was supposed \nto deliver Peter to his father in the beginning of the movie because for a \nshort time during the movie I thought Yondu was Peter's father, but then \nagain if the movie wanted me to think then they did a good job of throwing \nme through a loop. Ever since Thor 2 The Collector has just been one of \nthose interesting characters that I want to see more of and this movie I \ndon't think disappointed because I was able to see the great over the top \nhand gestures that really defines the character and makes him stand out, \nwell that and the costuming, but the movie also left me wanting to see more \nof his character and how he will develop and what he will do since his \ncollection was destroyed. Last but not least the end credits scene. I \nenjoyed the scene because it gave a funny look at how the Collector was \njust defeated over his ruined collection so he's just going to drink all of \nit away. As for Howard the Duck I thought it was a nice easter egg, but I \nthink you're right in the aspect that Marvel at this point only knows what \nwill happen in Age of Ultron, but I was not upset because that scene was \nsimilar to the shwarma scene in the Avengers, but I would have liked to see \nsome sort of plot building reveal. Well I hope I've given you some good \ndiscussion material and I really enjoyed your review and I'm excited to \nhear your thoughts on my really long response. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13duv5byni2y3ims23fwrphiwfwxflwq04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 6, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkAbGPf3QgKBbDqhMvLPg2Q", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Kenneth Steichen", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T04:14:56.448Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkAbGPf3QgKBbDqhMvLPg2Q"}, "sentiment_score": -0.93341750000000001, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T04:14:56.448Z", "likeCount": 76, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103910401727386621976", "textDisplay": "JESUS BAUTISTA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE KINDA WOODEN AND DEADPAN THAT WAS THE \nPOINT\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13uvz5ymybjjnpni22ksf3jbtzbffm0h": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaNMaMlYYLrrED-RuTp0P7g", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "shaquille simister", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-06T14:59:38.117Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCaNMaMlYYLrrED-RuTp0P7g"}, "sentiment_score": 0.64963199999999999, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-06T14:59:38.117Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/116937197340913484439", "textDisplay": "Lol its really interesting how everyone is bashing you Grace.

A lot of people with strong \nopinions about the source material and movie adaptation go to those \npremieres - yourself included - and I think you should do your best to \ncover a wider array of opinions, rather than dedicate 20 minutes to just \ntelling us how much you disliked the movie. Sorry for the rant, I still \nvery much appreciate what you are doing to inform us all about the exciting \nworld of cinema.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ngp3rlkvezfvf523kdn1pqs33c3us2": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZLqEVRfKi_4GiErCWq6PKw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jO7TtH6pqgI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/l3sh4QKWoJw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "vegaslim", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T07:05:51.108Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCZLqEVRfKi_4GiErCWq6PKw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.38896400000000003, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T07:05:51.108Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108241121637173583421", "textDisplay": "Wow, Grace I dig your opinion and normally always at least think it's \nrooted in points that make me think, but bro you're so off this time it's \nscary.

I think Grace is way too critical \nand is being prejudice about Gunn. Peter Quill was definitely not just a \nsleaze and had the perfect amount of douche to heart ratio, which is not an \neasy thing. I did not see Gamora as the flirt, she was the strong female \ncharacter which said that she didn't want to hurt people and is why she \nisn't acting like the 'deadliest woman in the galaxy'. Drax is meant to be \nwooden, THEY SAID THAT IN THE FILM. Thanos had the weight to be the calm \ndanger, Ronan in my opinion is meant to be just crazy and is different from \nthe comics. Nebula was one of the best villains in the marvel universe, she \nis completely mental and is angry because of her jealousy towards Gamora, \nalso why wouldn't a villain be angry. Without the NovaCorp the guardians \nwouldn't of been arrested and wouldn't have anything to protect. WHY WOULD \nANY DEATH BE LIKE YAY SOMEONE DIED, COMMON GRACE WTF. The Ravagers are just \nanother aspect to show StarLords rogue-ness, Michael Rooker owned that \ncharacter. The Collector is meant to be flamboyant and all knowing so why \nnot. The only part I agree with you slightly is your Rocket and Groot \nreview, although Rocket is a fleshed out character and Vin Diesel added a \nlot to the character.

Moreover, her comment on \"Starlord\" being revealed \nat the end as what his mom called him I thought was a coup of exposition - \nbrilliant. Something that most have thought of as being a silly affectation \nof Peter Quill's ego was finally revealed to have a deeper emotional \nmeaning - was great and noticeable precisely because of its placement at \nthe end of the movie, which was a challenge for us, viewers to slightly \nperhaps reexamine our previous reactions.

Now imagine if starlord moniker was placed in the beginning - would \nhave negated the point. Such basic misunderstanding of movie-making craft, \nand there is plenty of craft and art in this movie, is strange and kinda \npoints to a certain lack of sophistication on Grace's part, which also \nexplains many disliking Grace's review.

You lost me when you compared GotG to CAWS.\nThis is going to be a long rant so bear with me, let me point out were I \nthink you are wrong.\nFirst of All this is a Guardians of the Galaxy movie (not one of the single \ncharacters, so detailed origins for them will have to wait for other \nmovies) \nThe Sound Track: It almost hurt me physically when you said you wanted \n\"modern\" songs in this. They used these songs because Peter was supposed to \nbe abducted in the 80's and they are his anchor home.  I could agree with \nan original soundtrack but I was very happy with this (maybe I'm old and \nthis is the music I grew up with)\nPeter Quill: He is supposed to be a bad person.  He is a charming criminal \nbut no a sociopath which is why he tries tries to save the Galaxy.  The \nstar lord joke is good because you don't' know why he want to be call that \nand It becomes meaningful at the end when you realize it was his mom's pet \nname.  If they had that at the beginning it would have seem a little \npathetic every time he used it.\nGamora: I agree with you a little here, she was not used as well as she \ncould have. Like you said she is supposed to be the bad-ass of the \nbad-asses, that did not come well in the movie. The think you did not get \nabout the stick is that only we used that particular slang try saying that \nin South America and you will probably get Gamora's exact reaction.\nDrax: Here is where I disagree almost completely with you.  Batista is not \na great actor but in this movie they used him excellently.  He was the \nstraight man in the comedy routine and was great in it.  I laughed at all \nhis lines.  I actually like this a little better than the Drax in the \ncomics (and that is a very high complement coming from me because I love \nthe existentially conflicted Drax of the comics)\nRocket: I also loved him. nuff said.\nGroot: I agree with you that anyone could have voiced him. and he was \ngreat. I don't think they could have a solo movie. you would get tired of \nthem.  similar to what happen in the Hangover with Chao.\nI'll just say that the villains were the weak sauce of the movie just like \nRa's al Ghul was in Batman begins because they were not the center of the \nmovie.

I don't agree with everything you say but I'm on your \nside with majority of you opinions. \nNow that that's out of the way, I think you're COMPLETELY wrong on your \nreview of this film.  This is just like your other guilty pleasures, \n(*ahem, Transformers) she truly misses the mark on this one.\n(Come on Grace, how anyone of your caliber likes the Transformers franchise \nis beyond me.)\n \nWhere to even begin.  You have been saying for weeks, this movie won't \nbreak 100 million in its opening weekend.  I think it will.  Even with the \nlack of character development the way that Avengers had,   \nI think this movie has such a campy, summer feel, even as we\u2019re in August, \nthis movie just might have that slow burn to last a whole month, if not \nmore.\n \n(**I believe one of the reasons why the Avengers did so well was the luxury \nof time.  They had enough time and story to develop each the characters and \nreally pitch for a merger movie.  In my opinion, the success of Iron Man 1 \nreally kick started The Avengers franchise.  If it had been a flop, no \nAvengers. Secondly, when every Marvel movie hints at all the super heroes \ncoming together, you just can help but get swept up in the hype.)\n \nWhere it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re on Team Rocket Raccoon fan club, you\u2019re \nnegative opinion on Bautista (aka Drax) was totally FU.  Yes, Rocket had \nmany funny and even at time emotional scenes, but Bautista nailed his part \nas Drax.\nI think what you complete missed about Drax was that, yes, he was a muscle \nbound killing machine, but he was also a square.  He was like straight out \nof Harvard school of Soldier and all he did was train his body and mind, \nbut had no social life.  I normally don\u2019t lol in theaters, and where Rocket \nmade me chuckle out loud (especially when he was making fun of the \nCollector in his not so subtle way), I truly LOL on Drax\u2019s bits.  (The bit \nabout jokes going over his head, and when Quill was giving his best \nattempts at a pre-battle speech and Drax in the middle of it saying, I \nwasn\u2019t listening.  That was classic.)\n \nOh, and you keep comparing this movie to Star Trek.  Calling it Star Trek \nLight.  Check out Farscape.  This movie has more Farscape element than \nanyone is willing to give it credit.  Even straight down to their uniforms. \n \nI don\u2019t want this to be too long, so I\u2019ll end it here.\nI see a lot of remarks slamming Grace.  (The most amount of thumbs down \nI\u2019ve seen under 24 hours) But in Grace\u2019s defense, she\u2019s read the GotG \ncomics, knows the Marvel history and Lore (more than most of you guys \nleaving those FU comments).  I think she was just expecting way too much \nout of this movie.  Even though she herself had stated Marvel was taking a \nhuge gamble on this one, and she wasn\u2019t expecting much out of it.  She \nreally did a disservice to herself by expecting this movie to be somehow \nthe new \u201cStar Wars\u201d. \n \nOverall, this movie didn\u2019t have any new.  In fact this movie reminded me a \nlot of Farscape (as mentioned earlier), a bit of Star Trek: Into Darkness.  \nBut a roaring good fun none the less.  I too wasn\u2019t expecting much, but at \nthe end, totally worth it.  Better than Avengers in my opinion.

I also \ndidnt like Gamora and agree with u on the villians they were too basic and \nneeded more development they were not compelling at all to me. I loved \nrocket racoon I was worried that I would jus hear bradley cooper voice but \nhe disappeared into the role and did good voice acting. I did like the \nhumor but it got old the ending of him distracting the guy was cartoony. I \nwill say I actually felt like I got to know peter quill like wen he saved \nGamora and when he opened his moms gift but I agree more backstory would \nhav been good I knew more from the comics. In the end I was satisfied w the \nmovie but do not hav interest in a sequel I care much more about seeing a \ndoctor strange, black widow or captain america and other marvel characters \nthen GotG.

I \nthink what you missed from the whole thing is that it's the first Space \nOpera that was palatable since Star Wars. You might be thinking it was too \nshallow on a lot of aspects stemming from its sci-fi/fantasy origins but \nthat's why it worked. The reason there hasn't been another Star Wars since \nStar Wars is because delving too much into Space Opera aspects of those \nstories bores general audiences. This has been the problem with Dune, \nStargate, Chronicles of Riddick, and many others. But Guardians of the \nGalaxy had just enough Space Opera to keep the plot moving and prep future \nMarvel movies while filling the rest with a buddy-buddy heist movie. It's \nthe latter aspect of the movie that makes this work. Which is also why vast \nmajority of critics and audience members like this movie. Everyone at my \ntheater was cracking up the whole time. Did you not see this aspect of the \nmovie or did you just not appreciate it?\n\nAlso, Bautista, to me, was spot on as Drax. His timing was awesome. \nDefinitely my favorite character of the movie.\n\nI did notice one last thing which speaks to your point about how Marvel's \nvillains, aside from Loki, don't resonate with fans. It's because they \ndon't have a character arc. All of Marvel's villains simply serve as a plot \ndevice for the heroes to grow around. Red Skull, Iron Monger, Whiplash, \nMalekith, Chitauri, and Ronan are assholes from beginning to end without \nany real soul. But this isn't just the problem with the movies. Avengers \nvillains generally just suck. That's why, before the movies, X-Men was more \npopular. Villains like Magneto, Sabretooth, Emma Frost, and Mystique had \ncharacter arcs that could have justified solo series for any of them while \nthey were villains, and in some cases they did. You can't say that for any \nAvengers villain. Inherently, Marvel has the boring villains. But maybe if \nthey can figure something out with Kang, they could have something \ncompelling on their hands. What do you think?\n\nLong time fan and love your show as always :D\n\nRod\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13cvvoberbogfayz04chf5zckfrtlxxh5s": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCojKTIGKLQNXRVnZJobddbQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-V7Xhx2QGaAQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHA/GanuxnnbQaQ/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Rhys Jenkins", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-07T00:14:59.005Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCojKTIGKLQNXRVnZJobddbQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.076967999999999981, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-07T00:14:59.005Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115527722558210487721", "textDisplay": "I'm so sorry Grace, I have to disagree about the soundtrack.

Nebula was \nangry because she was jealous that Thanos called Gamora his favourite. That \nshot of Nebula's face after he said that wasn't random. And how does she \nnot look different?

It felt a bit like a string of scenes rather than a movie. After \nwatching it a second and third time I enjoyed it much more. I think I went \nin with an expectation that the film didn't live up to. Once I knew what I \nwas getting however I could sit down and just enjoy it. I think it's main \nissue was a lack of a strong plot, which I forgave afterwards due to how \nfun the movie was. Loved Groot and Rocket (though I agree there wasn't much \nneed for Vin Diesel's voice acting). I feel like I got more character from \nFilm Drax than the Drax in the comics and felt Zoe Saldana did a reasonable \njob. I liked how Gamora (ironically considering her origins) was in a way \nthe moral heart of the group, the one most trying to do the right thing. It \nhad a redemptive quality that I thought was nice. Overall despite some \nissues I had a great time watching the movie and would love a sequel, \nthough I think doing stand alone films for each of the characters is a \nterrible idea, they work best when interacting with one another.

To begin, you brought up that you \nthought the 70's music didn't work and you wanted an orchestral score. I \nthought the songs where expertly selected to help tell the story and build \nPeter Quill's character, and the movie did have a beautiful orchestral \nscore composed by Tyler Bates. Next, you argued that Peter Quill needed a \nmoment where we find out he's not just pick-up lines and genuinely has a \nheart. For me, that moment was when we find out that he calls himself \nStar-Lord because his mother called him Star-Lord, which is why I suspect \nthey left that moment till the end of the film rather than put it at the \nbeginning of the film like you suggested. You also mentioned that you felt \nthat someone who had not read the comics would not understand the plot or \nconnect with the characters. As someone who has never read the comics or \neven heard of these characters, I can personally guarantee you that \neverything made sense to me and I instantly connected with each of the \nGuardians. I also find it contradictory that you would suggest that it's \ndetrimental for people to have had to have read the comics to understand \nthe movie, but then complain that characters such as Gamora weren't \nrepresented the way they are in the comics. On the subject of Gamora, I \nagree Zoe Saldana didn't necessarily bring it in terms of her acting, but \nyou can't deny that she sold her action scenes extremely well (and I would \nmake the same argument for Karen Gillan's Nebula). Finally, you mentioned \nthat you don't think that there is enough demand for a sequel. As someone \nwho is currently enrolled in film school and spends a lot of time on many \ndifferent movie news websites, I can tell you that everyone I know in real \nlife is extremely excited about the sequel, and everything I've read on the \ninternet shows that the worldwide fanbase is ecstatic as well. Last I \nchecked, it's tracking to almost outperform Cap 2 at the box office this \nweekend. I hope maybe this has helped to change your opinion about what was \nmy favorite Marvel movie so far, but I realize you are entitled to your \nopinion as well. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ri5shjwmajxeme23nwtq45smktbg5i04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-FmEVd-d9X1pwXPTO33dbA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1IsMqli34zE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABg/XxOHaevxWko/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "birdpoop210", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T05:40:58.572Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-FmEVd-d9X1pwXPTO33dbA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.99038375999999995, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T05:40:58.572Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117093100920390073199", "textDisplay": "Grace you suck so hard \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13ys5pbiuv5yvkil04cfpsqjkr0dvupzyg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPXxIkMevPwWJl5IkLweBIg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YZzmTwNIt0E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC8/wFRP7S2cAQA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "AdamPaulStone", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-04T20:19:45.615Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPXxIkMevPwWJl5IkLweBIg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.87940639999999992, "formal_score": 39, "updatedAt": "2014-08-04T20:19:45.615Z", "likeCount": 4, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/109060200237630917580", "textDisplay": "Ha!

So I finally can comment on this movie since it only came out this \nweek in Portugal. I watched the non-spoiler review last week and held my \nbreath on this until i could give a proper opinion on the subject matter \nsince it immediately ignited such hateful opinions towards the review and \nGrace. And now I can say, I totally agree with Grace's opinion in right \nabout everything and I feel like I should stand up for her on this and be \nthankful for such an honest opinion. This is why I follow Grace\u00b4s channel \nand love it ! Grace, you are amazing and such a professional ! Like you, I \ndidn't dislike this movie, but i was quite disappointed, mainly for what it \ncould deliver but it didn't. I really liked the movie's opening and it \nreally looked promising. Most jokes are funny enough and both Rocket and \nGroot are adorable, and most of the production design is quite good. But \nthe storyline/plot is terribly weak and so is most of the performances. \nBoth Gamora and Drax are really flat boring and the villains... they aren't \nmenacing or interesting at all.

You saw it as a missed opportunity to have his character \nconnect with his mother and the name \"Star Lord\".  I saw it as confirmation \nto his name whether he created himself or if one of the Ravagers gave it to \nhim when he was a boy and he just thought, \"Hey, that's cool.  I'll run \nwith it.\"  And in that moment, he connected with his mother with her \nconfirmation. \n\nAs for Dave Batista's performance, I have to say that I thought he was \nplaying the straight man of the group so his performance worked.  I'm not \nfamiliar with any of these characters so I can't say that I expected his \nperformance to be any different.  Given the limited time, I thought his \nexposition as to what motivated his character was enough. \n\nMy big disappointment was more with Ronan.  They didn't show why he needed \nto be feared.  It was all done through exposition so he lost a lot of what \ncould have made him threatening.

It bothered me \nthat Yondu had a Southern accent. Perhaps you do have a point concerning \nMichael Rooker not bringing anything to the role. Secondly, it bothered me \nthat Rocket Raccoon what sounded like a Brooklyn accent. He sounded like an \nangry Bugs Bunny. I think as well you may have a point that his mother \ncalling him Star-Lord should have been referenced earlier in the film, \nperhaps at the beginning. \n\nBeyond that, I thought Guardians of the Galaxy was spectacular. I felt that \nChris Pratt did a good job getting out of that lovable doofus thing he's \ngot going on in Parks and Recreation. Gamora may be that deadliest assassin \nin the galaxy, but she hates Thanos for making her that. So, she's not \ngoing to go around killing people when she doesn't have to or whatever you \nwould prefer her to be doing. I don't feel there was much of a romance \nangle played up between Peter Quill and Gamora. There was just that whole \nthing about \"pelvic sorcery\" which made me laugh. Dave Bautista as Drax the \nDestroyer I will say again surprised me with how good he was in the role. \nAnd you know metaphors from foreign cultures can be difficult to understand \nfor anyone. Rocket and Groot were awesome; no fault in that. Was Vin Diesel \nunderutilized? Perhaps. I've heard rumors that he might be offered a second \nrole from Marvel. That may make up for it. Seeing Thanos fully for the \nfirst time in one of these movies really excited me. Karen Gillan as \nNebula... I'm a Doctor Who fan. I will always love her no matter what. It \nwas funny seeing John C. Reilly as a Nova Corps dude. Ronan getting \ndistracted by Peter Quill suddenly dancing worked because it was the last \nthing anyone would expect to happen given the circumstances. It's just one \nof those things you have to stop and just contemplate why this is \nhappening. The Collector honestly I have yet to see Thor: The Dark World so \nI have not opinion on that. But you know seeing Howard the Duck at the end \nshocked me because it was absolutely the last thing I expected to ever see. \nOverall, there's no denying Guardians of the Galaxy was a film that was a \nreal risk for Marvel to make.

I laughed and I teared up.  \nI walked out of their feeling great.  No, it was certainly not to the level \nof quality that Winter Soldier was, but it definitely delivered on what the \ntrailers promised me.  I had a lot of the same issues you did, Grace, but \nover all, I am satisfied with what I saw.  My take on each of your points \nfollows:\n\nI was fine that there was a crap ton of characters. In fact, for this \nmovie, I liked it.  While I appreciate your point about the benefit of \nspending time with each one like we did with the Avengers, I thought a nice \nbalance was struck here between giving us a variety of characters and \nenough time for us to get just the insight we needed\n\nI like that we didn't find out that Quill's mom referred to him as Starlord \nuntil the end, I liked that the whole time we're laughing at him for it but \nthen it gets revealed that there's a serious reason why he wants that name.\n\nI totally agree that Gamora got rescued way to much.    Why didn't she pick \nup on Peter and Rocket's strategy to use the mining pods to bash the \nnecro-ships instead of trying to run away from them?  And when Quill \nrescued her from the cold of space, emotionally I was like \"Yay, he saved \nher\", but intellectually I'm like \"Goddamn that was cliche, the feminists \nare going to have a field day with this.\"  While I can see how a love story \nadded balance to the film overall, something was missing here.  I also felt \nthat the bulk of her acting was TV-quality at best, and I had to ignore her \nwooden delivery the way I have to ignore the wooden acting in a lot of TV \nshows.\n\nDrax bothered me at first too, but when Rocket explained that he was \n\"totally literal\" I was able to go with it.\n\nRocket and Groot were the highlight of the show for sure. Loved them.  They \ncould totally hold there own in a Rocket & Groot movie if done right.  As a \nVin Diesal fan, I thought the various ways he delivered \"I am Groot\" were \ndelivered in the way that only Vin Diesal can, and it worked perfectly for \nthe character.\n\nThanos was underwhelming for me too: his voice, his lack of swagger, cliche \nplus the opposite of the epicness I expected from Thanos.  But he looked \ncool. \n\nRonan was meh, but he worked well enough for me as \"just a puppet.\"\n\nI liked that the Nova Corp were essentially just \"space-cops\".  When they \nall united there ships to try and keep Ronan back I got all \"Fuck yeah the \ncalvary is here!\"\n\nNebula was both hit and miss for me.  Her anger was explained by her facial \nexpression when Thanos referred to Gamora as his \"favorite\" daughter, but \nthe \"Get out of my way\" was pretty forced to me.  I liked her voice with \nthe FX that were added, much cooler than Gamora's.\n\nYondu I could have taken or left, but when he took out all those necros \nwith his whistle spear, I was like \"fuck yeah he's a badass red neck.\"  \nHe's now a character I hope we run into again.\n\nThe Collector worked for me.\n\nI must be one of the only people in the world who loved the Howard The Duck \nmovie back in the 80s ( I was 7 when I saw it ), so when he popped up \nsipping a margarita giving the Collector shit for letting the space-dog \nlick him, I was all \"hell yeah! inside joke!\"\n\nSo yeah, even though there were a LOT of things that bothered me through \nout, and James Gunn doesn't quite have what Joss Whedon does, I still loved \nit over all.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12edrupgmmewn5vz23xzzbhysn3jpjxe04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1UU_O98_B-QgSSRtQzexw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "RobBluNett", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T04:25:10.672Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCy1UU_O98_B-QgSSRtQzexw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.86320160000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T04:25:10.672Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101044203008344347708", "textDisplay": "Why is she so negative?

I mean, let's be honest, \nsuperheroes were originally made for kids and should still be primarily \nfocused of entertaining kids while still be good entertainment for an older \ncrowd like Avatar the Last Airbender, something it seems the comics don't \nseem to do.

Perhaps if you read the \ncomics then saw the movie again you will get it and change your mind other \nwise I think your out of touch with great comic book and great Sci-Fi \nfilms, next your probably not going to not get Nolan's Interstellar and \nbash that too. Be more prepared and read the source material before going \ninto a comic film and bashing a film that doesn't need to be bashed, this \nis your job so do it correctly other wise your going to loose subscribers \nand respect from your fans and other critics and entertainers. And yes \nGuardians of the Galaxy 2 is coming in 2017 so deal with it and by then I \nhope you have done your homework and your job and give that movie a better \nunderstanding of the source material review because its going to have the \nsame tone as the first film so be prepared. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13cet1wcx22vju4u04cjlggxyfgxdo4nko0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVYUVT0U7fmAdHLq4wk5Xlw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "charcoasian", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2015-03-21T12:32:34.026Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCVYUVT0U7fmAdHLq4wk5Xlw"}, "sentiment_score": 0.074829999999999952, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2015-03-21T12:32:34.026Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/100715829592334177436", "textDisplay": "Im sorry but you are way off here, im not a hard core fan and i have never \nseen a Guardians comic but i loved this film. Your view of Gamora is the \none i take issue with most. Her relationship with Nebula is clearly \nexplained in that Gamora is the adopted but favorite daughter, in essence \nit sibling rivalry mixed with Nebula`s inherited lunacy. For me i think she \ncomes across as very human but entirely badass in that she has been trained \nto be this monstrous assassin but in her heart she is everything but.  Her \nscene when she first arrives in prison emotes genuine fear and a feeling of \nbeing a duck out of water and when she walks through the inmates with her \nhead slightly dipped its like an attempt to lock the negativity out. To me \nshe clearly is someone that sees and hates how she is being viewed. She is \nsomeone brought up in the equivalent of a cult and always under their \ninfluence, now she is separate from that structure, possibly for the first \ntime and so becomes a character in conflict, in a way its nature versus \nnurture. When Star Lord saves her from Drax for no other reason than its \nthe right thing to do and then she witnesses Rockets brilliant escape plan \nyou can clearly see this that she enjoys being part of this potential team \nand sees the good in some of its members. Remember its her knowledge of the \ndanger of the infinity stone that is driving the team forward, not Star \nlords leadership.\n\nIn her final battle with Nebula this inner conflict comes to an end and you \nsee her displaying all her kickass skills but also is attempting to save \nher sister in the way she has been saved. Its her final seen with Drax that \nconcludes Gamoras story arc. She walks through the Milano and just lays her \nhand on Drax`s shoulder and the two share a quick glance and smile, the \nlook lasts less than a second but is one i am very familiar with. Ever \nwalked into a crowded bar and spotted a good friend of yours and the two of \nyou give each other a half smile and nod of the head? you are old friends, \nthere doesn't need to be a big public gesture, the smile says good to see \nyou mate and the nod says \"yeah buddy,we are  grabbing a few beers as soon \nas i find a few seats for the Missus and her friends\". Drax and Gamora have \nbecome friends and i believe that through Drax`s acceptance of Gamora she \nis now better able to accept herself.\n\nTo me this movie is as much about Gamora finding her place as it is about \nStar Lord finding his and she shows real progression through out the film \nand i liked it because of her. Im no movie genius and  i think we all take \ndifferent things away from films but again i state; you are way off on your \njudgement of Guardians in particular your judgement of Gamora.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z133tvxpowibylxew23syxchhsmxxlsxq04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPXMcbgunoepQfMq_1aohaA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Wlv3B2TleLM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/mHgqxq4T8vY/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "felix gabaldon", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-03T19:00:11.163Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCPXMcbgunoepQfMq_1aohaA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.18773200000000001, "formal_score": 4, "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T19:00:11.163Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102708903162784983443", "textDisplay": "I disagree totally with your review\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13iwffhlmivwv0jg04cgxj4bpfwijnor3c": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzMnoTRdJTI5rr077ZRIDhg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jZNW0rXVta8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGE/59N7VQETEAA/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.77821011673151752, "authorDisplayName": "Arden Blue", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T21:59:42.993Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCzMnoTRdJTI5rr077ZRIDhg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.11465400000000003, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T22:10:08.000Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112664489405014474826", "textDisplay": "Thorough review Grace, but this is def the first time I have ever \n*VERRRRRRY* strongly disagreed with.

And I had big expectations for this movie, I was sad, \neven considered not going to the theaters to watch it. \n\nBut thanks God I did go. This movie is amazing, is fresh, something so \ndifferent, awesome. It kept me interested, it made me curious, it brought \nme to places never seen before, with peculiar characters who acted so \ninteresting. \n\nPeter Quill is a supposed dumb young man, who steals things for living, for \nhimself he's a nobody, he's not heroic, although he is slowly turning into \nthat. You can't ask more of the persona on the moment. Look the people he \ngrew up with, bunch of stupid thieves, what else you would want from him \nthe personage? He is suppose to be that dumb, funny dude, with pick up \nlines, but with some flairs of a hero and a leader. I felt that. Who could \ndrag that crew together? Think about that.\n\nGamorra was reinvented, a suddenly doubtful woman, who wants to redeem \nherself. She could have been more important as you wanted, but that would \ndrag to much attention to her, and this movie is about the GOTG, not \nGamorra. She's a killer bot who is in search of her sentimental feelings, \nthat was awesome. \n\nDrax, I think Bautista was the perfect match for that. He's not an actual \nactor, that was the funny of it. A clumsy dumb killer, who has no problems \nkilling people, but at the same time he has a heart, but he fails to \nexpress he's feelings, because he makes them look so fake, as if he's not \ngood at it. That was funny. \n\nRocket Raccoon, was awesome, a smart modified animal, who acts like a \nhuman, with a killer humor, badass, but at the same time fragile on the \ninside. Acted so natural, it was like those raccoons actually existed, I \nbelieved in its existence. \n\nGroot, represented life at its best form. Within all that machinery he was \nthe other side. Badass and funny. Monster and human actions. Tha mix of a \nso different character was awesome.\n\nRonan, was okay, he was weak of course, more because of his brains. But I \nthink that was wanted by the producers. \n\nThanos, we had only a glimpse. He did not do anything else but talked to \nRonan, so we can't judge him. But acted like he knew what was going to \nhappen to Ronan, so he didnt even care about him. And that's powerful for \nme. \n\nHow come you say there was no sentimental things on this movie? The idea of \na team of the weirdest crew? The turning of a playa like Quill into someone \nwho saves the girl? The girl who feels things but do not want to? Groot?? \nThere was a strong feeling attachment for me on the movie. \n\nThe movie is simple, and is hard to understand how they were able to do \nthat. Because the story seems so complicated and confused, and it would be \nboring. But look at that the turned into a simple and funny movie.

I thought the movie \nwas fun and I enjoyed the soundtrack so much I bought it as soon as I got \nhome. I disliked Frozen as you did, and I'm not a blind Marvel/Disney fan; \nin fact I haven't even seen a single Thor or Capt. America movie and I've \nnever read a lick of the Guardian's comic but I highly enjoyed the movie \nand felt it was fun summer movie.\n\nHowever I do agree on the romance. I think this is probably why girls just \ncan't be on teams because then they'll HAVE to have some romance going on \nfor no reason. But over all I though Gamora wasn't half bad. As for her \nneeding \"saving\" I didn't see her need it a lot.

I agree that the movie was Rocket's and Groot's. They \nwere my absolute favorite things in this film. And I actually quite loved \nthat Vin Diesel was the voice of Groot because it reminded me so much of \nwhen he did the voice of The Iron Giant. It makes me wonder if they did \nthat on purpose.\nTo be fair, I don't think all the Marvel films need to be Cap 2, which is \nstill far and away the best film I've seen this year, so I had fun with \nthis film. I went in not knowing a lot but I guess my faith in Marvel is \nallowing me to be ok with not knowing a lot. I just tell myself, \"Well, \nit'll make sense once it's time for it.\" LOL Also, I personally really \nenjoy the Thor films though I acknowledge that they are flawed, so I am \nfond of this film in the same way.\nI was also wondering why they threw that tidbit on Starlord's father at the \nend with like one line. Either they should have dove in a little more or \njust kept it out of the film and make it a big thing in the sequel. I \nthought that was poorly handled.\nAgain, this could have been a good villain but we got the same old bad guy \nwho for... reasons wants to destroy a planet and he wants to do so with a \npowerful weapon but our heroes stop them. It can only work so many times. \nAt least with Loki we understand that it's because he's mentally unstable \nand he's doing it to piss off his father and brother. But we had a whole \nprevious film to build that up.\nI hope Marvel isn't blind to the problems they still have, and will improve \nthem rather than ignore them and just eat up the good stuff they have \ngoing. I want more female roles where they are part of a team and a fleshed \nout character not just one of the hero's love interest. So far, The \nAvengers and Cap 2 have done well with that. I want good villains who have \nmore purpose than just destroying/taking over a planet.\nSo Guardians of the Galaxy isn't perfect but I really enjoyed it, and I \nliked the acting in the movie. And I hope you know that I still love your \nreviews Grace. I'm glad that you're honest with your opinions rather than \nlie and say you like it just to appease to the people angry with you right \nnow. LOL Hope the next movie you see will be one you enjoy more. :)\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ix105uwyhin1jw04citpgyzipehoj4fs": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7c7TygAFk9X22Yavt8232A", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s8yS0vesnZA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB4/ETQXe-JnsEw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Nick The Epic", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T03:44:59.602Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7c7TygAFk9X22Yavt8232A"}, "sentiment_score": 0.425456, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T03:44:59.602Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108641217796110053236", "textDisplay": "I must say, I feel like you were a little bit to harsh on the film.

I and all my friends loved it and I've \nalready seen it a second time. Only one of my friends follows the comics \nbut even he loved the movie. Normally I agree with a lot of your reviews \nbut frankly I don't know why you are so negative about the movie.\n\nI'm already counting the days for the second movie. It would have been nice \nif they brought more into the movie about the father but they did mention \nin two separate parts of the movie that the pirates were originally hired \nto take him to his father. Both scenes were so quick that I can understand \nhow that could have been missed.\n\nSadly your favorite part of the movie was my least favorite part as I \nreally didn't need the hospital scene I thought it was a little heavy \nhanded. especially the part how his mother stated that his father was going \nto come for him, then surprise surprise he was abducted by aliens 45 \nseconds after his mother died. Why so soon that just seamed to be the most \nforced part of the entire movie. I did absolutely remember the gift the \nentire movie as they showed it at least one other time when Rocket was \nmaking his bomb.\n\nI'm actually glad that they didn't focus on Thanos and the Infinity \nGauntlet that much. I don't think people have forgotten about the stones as \nmuch as you think. Each of the stones revealed so far has been a major \nforce to overcome. I like that Thanos is an unknown at this point. The \nnon-comic audience needs to be slowly introduced to him. If they are not \ngoing to fight him in the movie then I want him to be a menacing third \nparty. He is interesting in the outcome but thinks everyone to be beneath \nhim so he doesn't need to concern him self in the events of the day. Sure \nhe is eventually going to wake up and be the really big bad but that is not \nthis movie. If that is what your waiting for then you are going to have no \nlove for the Marvel movies for a very long time.\n\nAs far as the Howard the duck scene it was cute I was expecting it because \nof a leaked credit mentioning Howard the duck. Frankly this is the only \nmovie that Howard would look halfway at home given the current Marvel \nmovies he could never make a 30 second cameo in any of them with out it \nbeing a thumb in the eye. Sure I would like a peak at the next movie to \ncome and I probably will not sit through the credits to ever see that again \nbut it was a nod to were Marvel has come from.\n\nAbout the music I loved every second of the music. Honestly other then the \nthree or four main scenes were they focused on the music. I thought it was \nunobtrusive and just faded into that background, The beginning ruins, the \njail scene,  teaching Gamoria about music and the dance off, are the scenes \nthat I'm referring too.\n\nI went into this movie only hoping to be entertained and wanting it to be a \ngood movie. In my eyes it was a great movie. It may not be Captain America \n2 but to me it is as good if not a little better and I loved watching \nCaptain America 2.\n\nThis is one of the only times that I can say that I'm glad I hadn't watched \nany of your reviews of this movie before seeing it because I would have \nbeen very hesitant to see it. Not sure why it effected you so negatively \nmaybe you wanted Marvels biggest gamble by far to be the best movie of the \nfranchise and tie together all the other movies. When to me this movie was \nto be a guilty pleasure and in the end it was far better then I could have \never hoped. They can work on the back story in the future. I'm now eager to \nsee what Marvel can do with the other unknown properties like doctor \nstrange and Ant Man (I think that is Marvel's, please forgive me if it is \nnot). I had written those movies off completely and now am curious to see \nwhat they make of them because to me Marvel has done no wrong.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13jh52x2wvggdlss225u5nz3wmjdtpfz": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrrn1pJjN6qvnDt4ZQPz3gA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--2yXhmwxor8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAn8/9GshQw8q8uM/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Michael Clancy", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-10T14:24:18.654Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCrrn1pJjN6qvnDt4ZQPz3gA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.30513799999999996, "formal_score": 2, "updatedAt": "2014-08-10T14:24:18.654Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112682173173831620650", "textDisplay": "GotG has too many characters?

And you're totally allowed \nthat, but it just doesn't seem fair or professional to generalize an entire \naudience. I have never read a comic (my husband has), and I enjoyed this \nthoroughly. It was fun, heartwarming, with serious franchise potential. It \nis PG-13, and my husband and I took our daughter and she loved it, but we \ndid know it's rating. And I think it's at the parents discretion, but it's \nnot grossly vulgar or insulting. I loved the soundtrack, classics and \nplayed perfectly to great effect. But I also don't believe the film needed \na heavy origin for each character, including saving Peter's father, who my \nhusband tells me is some kind of royalty, for the sequel. I was happy we \ncould jump right into the film and hit the ground running.\n\nIt felt like Star Wars, you were dropped in, and told to go with it. I did, \nand I loved it. I am tired of the heavy origins, we're in a post origin \nworld now, I hope, and i think it's time to find new ways to approach \nintroducing these characters. And Guardians handled it deftly.\n\nAs for his Starlord alias, I really loved that it was saved for the end, it \njust added a retroactive depth and heart. I, honestly, felt it was better \napplied than fed at the beginning.\n\nThis layered approach to origins was fair. The first act wasn't an info \ndump, and I didn't feel like being spoon-fed again. This was a great way to \nhandle introducing a cast of characters. Especially a group like the \nGuardians.\n\nRonan was one of the most solid villains Marvel has had in a while. He's a \nreligious, genocidal zealot, with far stronger motivations than the Dark \nElves or even Red Skull. In my opinion. I totally got what he wanted, \nhowever simplistic, but at least his motives were clear.\n\nNebula was far too underutilized, I wanted more of her. I felt like she was \nthe jealous daughter/sister, and wanted Thanos' approval, but that's me \ndrawing conclusions, and I get not everyone will create their own canon.\n\nGroot was fantastic, Vin Diesel really nailed the role. I've heard several \nactors, from Michael Clark Duncan to Kevin Michael Richardson, and none \nhave brought the heart and character to the role. And I was so shocked to \nfind how much Vin brought to the role with limited dialogue. But it really \nmatters. And he nailed it.\n\nRocket was the best thing about this movie, my husband wants the Adventures \nof Rocket & Groot, they were the stars.\n\nBut you're generalizations are unfair, audiences have loved this movie, \nleaving the theater thrilled, everyone I know has seen it with their \nfamilies, and some have seen it twice. This is all hearsay, but this film \nwill have a strong following. And more people want the sequel than you \nthink. And it's really not your place to determine what audiences want. \nIt's your place to give a review, not tell us how we should feel. Which is \nwhat you were doing.\n\nI want a sequel. I loved the film and I had never heard of these people. I \nfollowed it easily. And I thought this film managed the origins in the most \napt, best way possible, by using the whole of the film, instead of an info \ndump in the first act. The best stories can handle these, and Guardians did \nsolidly.\n\nWas the movie in love with itself? Absolutely. The poster even says; \n\"You're Welcome.\" And it's that attitude that made this film the best. I \nloved it.\n\nI respectfully disagree, and you're totally allowed your opinion. I just \ndisagree with your statement that only hardcore fans can get this film. \nThat's insulting to me and kids who love it. And that is definitely not \nyour right, and I don't respect that. It's why I initially had to respond.\n\nThanos felt, to me, like Palpatine in Empire Strikes Back, his first \nappearance over the hologram. You don't really know or understand why you \nshould fear him, or why these villains do. But you sort of get it. I have \nno idea who Josh Brolin is, but I loved Thanos, for his few moments anyway.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12yd1h4wuqvtdqbn04ccdqihsyxujx4fek": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRepl4C14EyU6JGYUs0TFDg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "FraracciJ", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-05T20:05:12.651Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCRepl4C14EyU6JGYUs0TFDg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.40141000000000004, "formal_score": 40, "updatedAt": "2014-08-05T20:05:12.651Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/105097173807574631138", "textDisplay": "The \"will return\" has been in some other marvel movie endings ex.

And butesta ( sorry if i \nspelled thst wrong but the guy who played drax) was good in the movie. He \nhad great comedic timing.

If all of these characters had solo movies it would take \nanother five years just to get to guardians and by that point would anyone \nreally care? Marvel made this movie to see how fans and mainstream movie \ngoers would react to it and seeing as how pretty much everyone, comic fans \nand none comic fans, loved it is why we are getting sequels.

I agree with you \nabout Rocket & Groot, and also on the underwhelming performance of Gamora \n(possibly Saldana as an extension of that). I felt that Gamora should have \nbeen way more tough and should have fought ten times better. The inmates at \nthe prison should have left her alone because of her reputation for being \nthe deadliest assassin in the galaxy.\n\nI feel similar about Drax, who should have been a lot more powerful than he \nwas. However, I thought Bautista's acting was great for this character \n(especially the deadpan humor). Quill is hard for me to get 100% behind but \nI did understand his character, his motives, and the dance-off at the end \nwas so random that it caused Ronan (plenty powerful but underdeveloped) to \npause deciding whether it was an attack or not, which was sufficient time \nfor Rocket to re-build his super-gun.\n\nI thought the team worked well together and can continue to work well \ntogether. We don't need origin stories movies for every character of every \nteam we want to make into a movie. This movie did enough, in my opinion, to \nsatisfy everyone's origin (except for Ronan) reducing the need for origin \nmovies. Thanos should have been given an action sequence, if only to put \nRonan in his place and that would have really improved Thanos's appearance \nand build up fear of him.\n\nThe Nova corp was a cool idea but seemed more like an after-thought, or at \nleast was treated that way. Again, another example of underpowering \npowerful characters. (But i really like the uniforms of the ones wearing \nhelmets; I'm a huge Nova fan.)

The problem with this movie is that they just didn't \nexplain things well enough.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13jxjxbxmy3vd5mj22ughcb5pn1cbsvj": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3GhMiPg_pcOw-NJBZhIFKA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3-nIXeXpsrw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEL0/ukjzVipdgwI/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "keri barley", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T07:31:19.896Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3GhMiPg_pcOw-NJBZhIFKA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.9729000000000001, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T07:31:19.896Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110719351114305600384", "textDisplay": "I loved the review, thanks.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12efhbouorfdvmtr232hd3j4miey5p2g": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFr-1_kgZL8162aDBi8BPIQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "TheOmegaknightmare", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-03T14:36:54.772Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCFr-1_kgZL8162aDBi8BPIQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.9972783300000001, "formal_score": 47, "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T14:36:54.772Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110007647910528150159", "textDisplay": "What is perfection?\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12ny3tqplv3ebsde23hszfokk2iixow204": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrRRboX5fIa3qwpI77PCkg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "MJosephB", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T20:17:22.788Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCsrRRboX5fIa3qwpI77PCkg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.22859000000000002, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T20:17:22.788Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117247850535662413434", "textDisplay": "Well, this review belongs in the pile along with her Frozen and Gravity \nreviews, where Ms. Randolph just seemed to interpret the movie  WAY \ndifferent than most people.

I feel sometimes \nyou see things too harsh, I agree the movie has its faults but its not as \nbad as you portray it to be. The end credit scene I found extremely funny, \nI didn't see it in a technical light like you did, which kinda ruins the \nexperience for me. I felt as if it matched the tone of the movie. The only \nthings I agree with you on is that Gamora needed to be more powerful, and \nVin Deisel didn't need to voice Groot. To say that Marvel is on the \n\"cutting edge\" is understandable but to say this doesn't fit into the \nmarvel universe is a major over statement. It was a different take on a \nfilm that is trying to connect with new/non-comic book readers, and best \nway to connect with anyone is to make them laugh. Grace you must remember \nthat this team is not the Avengers, they made it so the Guardians wouldn't \nbe a carbon cut out of the Avengers so when the time comes when they meet \nin a film it will be interesting. I find it really sad that you view movies \nin such a harsh light, that takes away from an experience when all you you \nsee is facts and numbers.

I agree with you that his back \nstory could have been handled in the sequel which will likely include his \nFather.  Unlike you I really didn't like the opening scene.  None of the \nacting there sold me.  The Mom didn't look sick so much as she did an \nalien.  I went with my younger siblings and they both thought that she was \nan Alien.  So I didn't like that at all.  It only served to tie to movie in \nwith the Marvel Cinematic Universe in that it established how we could have \na sci-fi movie that takes place alongside the rest of the MCU.  But I think \nChris Pratt did a good job.  He was funny and I thought he acted as a good \nbalance for the rest of the cast.  But they definitely didn't sell his own \nemotional scenes.  The opening of the present was lame.  I was hoping it \nwas something from his Father but as soon as he told Gamora that his mom \nloved sharing her favourite music with him then I knew I was going to be \ndisappointed with that reveal.\n\nGamora:  I agree with you in that Gamora was a poorly written and depicted \ncharacter in this film.  I didn't buy the romance that they tried to push \nwith Quill.  I wasn't invested in her back story at all.  Hell, I liked \nNebula more than her and I've just about completely forgotten Nebula's \nmotives in the movie.  Only that she wants Thanos dead just like Gamora. \n So yeah.  Of the Guardian's, Gamora is the weakest link.  I do think \nthough that Zoe Saldana did her best with what was given.  I didn't find \nher acting as flat as you apparently did.\n\nDrax:  This was the biggest surprise for me.  When I heard Batista had been \ngiven the role I was skeptical at best.  Those first few scenes didn't help \nat all.  But the humor with his character eventually won me over.  I loved \nat how metaphors went right over his head (Thought nothing goes over his \nhead.  His reflexes are too fast xD).  My biggest qualm with Drax was at \nhow weak he seemed when he fought just about everyone outside of the Prison \nescape.  For someone with the name of the Destroyer he sure lacked any epic \nfight scene.  I would have thought that he would have been able to do a \nlittle more to Ronin but alas that wasn't the case.  But I thought Batista \ndid the deadpan humor quite well (better than his intimidation in the \nPrison that is for sure) and the feels with him were more believable than \nwith Quill or Gemora.\n\nRocket and Groot:  Totally agree with you.  They won the show for me. \n Rocket was nearly flawless.  MY only beef with Groot was that he was a \ndeus ex machina character.  When the Guardians were in a bind, Groot to the \nrescue.  Guess he had to make up for taking that purple battery out so \nearly in the movie.\n\nThanos:  This is where I disagree with you almost completely.  Thanos \nwasn't the villain of this movie.  He didn't need to be flashy or overly \nactive.  He is the big bad in the MCU.  He can afford to listless when it \ncomes to the little threat that Ronin posses to him and that was really \nwhat he was up against.  He's the man with the plan.  He doesn't need to be \nrushed to get just one Infinity stone.\n\nRonan:  Had some cool scenes but was too one dimensional.  So yeah, I \nmostly agree with you here.  Marvel really needs to tune in that to have a \nsuccessful CU they need good persistent villains as much as they need their \nheroes.\n\nNebula:  I liked her more than Gemora.  Though she was far, far, from \nperfect.\n\nYondu:  I disagree here too.  I thought the actor did a fine job for the \nrole.  I don't like at how they explained his connection to Quill by him \nbeing hired to take him back.  But it was heavily implied from the early \nscenes with him that he had some connection to Quill beyond just abducting \nhim so I did like that.\n\nBut yeah.  Over all I really liked this movie.  It wasn't great.  Marvel \nmovies have definitely lost their novelty and it will take more than what \nwe have been given to truly impress me but I didn't feel like I wasted \nmoney seeing it.  I would recommend anyone who has been enjoying the MCU to \nsee it.  People who haven't been able to get into it, this won't be the \nmovie to get you watching Superhero movies.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13yt54ipub0exaso23cyhezsvbwj5z0v": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOY4U12NyZxxTx9QJMDnjyQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "David Rolwes", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-03T12:37:26.314Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOY4U12NyZxxTx9QJMDnjyQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.82986629999999995, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T12:37:26.314Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108028465320301300762", "textDisplay": "I don't know what she's talking about I thought the movie was great\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13adp0iknipstygi04cebdwoymetpygcr00k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 3, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoV69kdY6MFmdPsIHZez3dg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Avianon", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-01T19:48:20.596Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoV69kdY6MFmdPsIHZez3dg"}, "sentiment_score": 0.23158799999999996, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-01T19:48:20.596Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/103878880146881411455", "textDisplay": "Okay, so you guess which movie this plot is from:\n\"We'll have to stop [bad guy dressed in black whose backstory we've barely \ntouched upon] from taking the [powerful energy source item we used to have \nwhich he now has] to [place] or he'll destroy the world for no great \nreason!\"\n\nIs it:\n1) Guardians of the Galaxy\n2) Thor: The Dark World\n3) Both and Marvel's getting lazy\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKbn_YoozyvijHyeaypqutA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "HadesFist", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z13adp0iknipstygi04cebdwoymetpygcr00k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-01T20:38:49.342Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCKbn_YoozyvijHyeaypqutA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.78001199999999993, "formal_score": 51, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-01T20:38:49.342Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108911164937618724921", "textDisplay": "+Avianon\nYou're missing the point, I'm saying that the plot of bad guy in black \ntrying to obtain power (sauron trying to find the one ring) is a part of \nthe classical cinema.

I have never read more than a few random Marvel comics and that was \nin the late 90s. I have seen the Marvel movies but some I found super \nboring and didn't care to memorise all the fancy names for the fancy \nartefacts and so on. And still, this film was a walk in the park plot wise. \nI had not a single moment when I felt I don't know what the scene is about. \nThe plot is very consistent and easy to follow. and even though I totally \nfailed to register any previous mentions of infinity stones (in other \nmovies) after this flick I got the message, they are some big evil prize \nfor the big evil guy.\nAnd Peter is a very likeable character, and I loved they skipped the origin \nstory because these origin setting up films are all the same. I waited for \nhim to open the package the whole movie, wondering what's in it and I loved \nthat they made me wait. Is it info on his obviously space dad (aliens \nwouldn't have abducted him just moments after his mother told him that his \ndad is going to come back for him if he didn't have a space dad... that was \nsuper obvious for anyone with two neurons to rub together)? Is it some \nmagical weapon or space treasure? Will the box contents save them in the \nend? I loved that he struggled with opening it and hid it. This actually \ntold the viewer a lot about his character. And when he finally opened the \nbox it was super cheesy and made me very happy. I mean this is a film with \na final battle resolved like in Sailor Moon finale and the tape just worked \nreally well after that.\nI also loved how Gomora never bought for a moment his cheap lines. I loved \nher complicated relationship with Nebula. And Nebula is not angry for being \nangry. We can clearly see she feels abandoned by Gomora. And she doesn't \nlike to have it rubbed in that she is not the favourite \"daughter\", even \nthough she hates the big evil dude as much as everyone else does. And she \ndoesn't dig the lame douche with the hammer either and she is stuck with \nhim. <-- you telling me that he is another reformed villain turned hero in \nthe comics makes me happy they killed him in the film, or at least I hope \nthey did. This evil turned good routine is so old and lame. And so overused \nin these never-ending stories, where the writers are not allowed to come to \nany conclusion, because they cannot finish a series once and for all \nbecause it would cut off the money flow, but they are running out of ideas \nso they get a minor villain to come to the good side... *eye roll*\nI loved that none of the heroes was overpowered. And Gomora truly needed \nsaving only in the space scene, where she was at a disadvantage from the \nstart of the chase and it was obvious she won't run away, because that \nwould completly make no sense. Not in the prison though - in prison she is \na typical tactician waiting for a moment when it would be least risky to \ntake action. the fact that the infinity stone is this typical comic book \noverpowered, over the top, sad plot device is the only thing that didn't \nreally work for me in this movie.\nAnd really I would like to dispute almost every single point you made in \nthis review, but seriously I don't think it would matter or change you \nmind, also my comment is super long as it is.\nTo sum up I find is startling that I, a person who has a very limited \nknowledge of Marvel universe, had absolutely no problem with this film and \nwith how it sets up its characters and you a comic book specialist found it \nhard to follow and imho failed to notice more than half of the interesting \nstuff in it. The script here was very clear and had very pleasant character \ndevelopment which is almost absent in many other Marvel movies which makes \nthem boring to people who do not dig the whole superhero mythos. And sure \nas hell I don't. And this is why the Winter soldier, the Guardians and 1st \nThor are the only marvel films resonating with me to the point of actually \nenjoying them - they do not have the typical super hero in goofy outfit \nsaves the day vibe and that is actually cool.  \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z13xih4qzoy4z1svk22ddl3iqpviz5u4d04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 3, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF1M7Q53leJYDnScZUIRLzA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xhA_DUskT58/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/KyGbDE7EgGk/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.067636117686844771, "authorDisplayName": "Matthew Wannell", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-01T22:19:28.259Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCF1M7Q53leJYDnScZUIRLzA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.35657399999999995, "formal_score": 4, "updatedAt": "2014-08-01T22:19:28.259Z", "likeCount": 5, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/115316944941761660021", "textDisplay": "I want to premise this comment by saying that I am a massive fan of Beyond \nthe Trailer (I tune in every day) and that I have a huge amount of respect \nfor you and your opinions. However having seen Guardians of the Galaxy and \nnow having seen your reviews I am left confused by your overly critical \nreview given that Guardians was one of the best films I have ever seen (I \nwould actually put it on my top 10 list). \n\nFirstly I have seen your coverage of the trailers and such and I don't \nunderstand why you think the trailers promised something different from \nwhat we got. Chris Pratt was the same in the trailers as he was in the \nmovie and you are up his performances in the trailers and you have gone on \nand on about him becoming a 'movie star' and yet you dump on his portrayal \nas star lord in the movie and compare it to Captain Kirk from Star Trek. \nThe tone of this movie is completely different from Star Trek and Chris \nPratt's performance outshone that of Chris Pine. If anything Pratt was \nreminiscent of Han Solo in Star Wars which is high praise indeed (and we \nhave been wondering who will take up Harrison Ford's mantle). To say that \nPratt seemed like he was still acting in Parks and Recreation is totally \nunfair. And again if you liked the tone and humour and performance in the \ntrailers then why not the movie? What changed Grace?\n\nNext you criticise the film for being too slow (which it wasn't) but then \nyou complain that there wasn't enough background, explanation, and \ncharacter development which would have slowed the movie down. You can't \nhave the best of both worlds Grace and you have to admit that you totally \n(and unfairly) contradicted yourself in this review to criticise this \n(totally awesome) movie. Also you loved Xmen days of future past and yet \nthat movie was criticised in many reviews for being too slow (or more \naccurately slowing down towards the middle). You never criticised Xmen for \nthis and instead showered the film in praise despite it not being a totally \nperfect movie. \n\nI believe that the core of your criticism (the source of your \ndisappointment) comes from the weak female characters. Now I want to be \nfair, I respect your opinions and I respect you as a female movie goer and \nI respect your feminist leanings however I believe that it is this aspect \nof your opinions that has coloured your views on this movie. If this movie \nhad had strong female characters and a feminist subplot (like malificent) \nthen I bet you would have given this movie a much better review. I do agree \nthat the female characters in this movie were weak and sidelined and I vet \nthat that must be frustrating for you as a female movie goer. Glamor a \nwasn't the deadly assassin that she could have been. However I think that \nthey had to bring balance to the guardians team, Gamora had to fit into it \nand be somewhat equal to them. Plus Gamora didn't get many scenes in \ngeneral in this movie but with so much to cover that isn't surprising. She \nalso wasn't explored much as a character or given any development but again \nthat is to be expected in this movie. But seeing as how she is the daughter \nof Thanos we know that she will become more central to the plot in future \nmovies and hopefully not only will we be able to explore her background and \nsee some character development but she will get more scenes and hopefully \nwe will see her kick more ass and be the cool assassin we know she is! I \nwould also like to ask why it is that you don't like Zoe Saldana? You dump \non her in pretty much everything she is in (including this movie) and yet \nshe is a very very successful female actress (a female actress of colour no \nless) that is in 3 major blockbuster franchises. I respect your opinion to \ndislike her but to dump on her in every review and to give actresses like \nHali Berry a free pass for piss poor performances just doesn't seem fair to \nme (her portrayal as Storm in Xmen is disrespectful to that character and \nthe franchise).I think that Nebula was pretty terrible and badly portrayed \nby Karen Gillan. I am a whovian and she is good in that show however \nwithout her pretty good looks and in this emotionally dead character she \nhad a difficult time. Again though there was no background to her character \nand she didn't get many scenes to impress us. Hopefully in the next film \nagain she will have more opportunities to improve and have more to do. \n(Also I thought her costume and make up was a bit off, I wish they had made \nher look more like a kree version of Ventress from Star Wars rather than \nsome weird cyborg with a patchwork of different shades of blue makeup).\n\nFinally I would like to defend Dave Bautista (something I never thought I \nwould say). You were totally harsh on him given that he did a surprisingly \ngood job. Was he brilliant? No. But he did a good job with the (very well \nwritten) material he was given. I also think that he did a good job with \nhis fight scenes and it was cool to see some actual fight scenes in a \nmarvel movie (like in Captain America) rather than just a load of CGI fake \ngreen screen action. Dave Bautista isn't an acting genius but he was well \nimagined as Drax. I actually wish that the Rock (Dwayne Johnsone) would \nwatch this and give up on trying to act and just play to his strengths. You \ngive Dwayne Johnsone a pass all of the time but he cannot act any better \nthan Dave Bautista and at least James Gunn realised Dave Bautista's \nlimitations and gave him lines that he could effectively deliver (which he \ndid again and again to the hilarity of the whole movie theatre). \n\nAlso I did love Groot and Rocket, I too thought they were adorable. Would I \nwant to see an entire movie of them though? He'll no. Why? Because they \nneed to be balanced with the whole team. On their own they wouldn't be any \nwhere near as effective or funny. Plus there is no background or character \ndevelopment to explore with them. The shot of Rocket's back was all that \nneeded to be said. They have their use in future team movies but alone they \nwould have no success. \n\nI hope that your coverage going forward is fair and not still coloured by \nyour opinions. If this movie does do very well this weekend at the box \noffice and if it is considered a mainstream success and it does get a \nsequel then much like with Frozen I think you are going to have to accept \nthat you are in the minority and go along with the franchises success \n(though I actually agreed with your opinions on Frozen, I was a fan of the \ninitial concept art and not the finished product). \n\nOne last thing actually before I forget; Thanos didn't get much coverage in \nthis movie however I think that as Avengers Age of Ultron is still a year \noff and that he is the big bad in avengers 3 which is who knows how many \nyears away how could they give him much coverage? Also they had to give \nscreen time to Ronan the Accuser who despite being the main villain still \nwasn't given enough coverage and was a bit of a weak villain. I think you \nare just going to have to be patient for Thanos like the rest of us. Also I \nam not a Howard the Duck fan but I liked the end credit scene and the fan \nboys in the theatre I was in went crazy for it. Those kind of nods to the \nfans are what makes Marvel's movies fun. Also given that the next Marvel \nmovie is Avengers 2 what could they have done for the end credit scene with \nGuardians being so far removed from the Avengers atm? For now Guardians is \na stand alone movie and we are going to have to wait for phase 3 for that \nto change. Therefore they had a end credit scene which they couldn't do \nmuch with and so they decided on doing some fan service. Is that fair to \ncriticise? Nope.

I \nfeel like you watched a different movie. What you could expect from this \nmovies were a few things: 1, Marvel was taking a risk doing a movie about a \nteam mostly unknown to audiences. 2, we knew the tone of the movie would be \nmore humorous and comedic. 3, the setting would be completely different \nthan those of previous marvel studios movies. Marvel studios and James Gunn \nwere aware of these facts and built on them. They realized the audiences \nmay feel alienated from this movie, that's why it was mostly Star Lord's \nbackstory as the half human and the use of catchy 70-80's music was such a \ngenius idea (kudos to Gunn for that). The movie never took itself seriously \nand that is why it had its charm.\nI don't really get your nitpick about \"Star Lord\" as nickname. I mean the \nscene where his mother dies was ment to be harsh and fast paced. The scene \nsuggested Peter would have some regrets (not giving his hand to his mother) \nas an adult later on. throughout the movie he revealed more details about \nhis childhood and he mentioned the mix tape as a memento of his and his \nmothers relationship. So when he read the letter at the end and his mother \ncalled him \"her little Star Lord\" it was really sweet and brought a tear in \nmy eye. You did not grasp the symbolism with the mixtape vol.2 either. It \nwas just beatiful and did not feel like a cheezy cliche to me. \nI was also worried about Bautista as an actor, but I was pleasantly \nsurprised about his performance. I don't know about the comic version od \nDrax, but this movie version felt robotic, strict, humorless, distant. \nbautista played that role. \nRonan being distracted by that dance mirrors the tone and seriousness of \nthis movie. If you did not find it funny, you just took the movie too \nseriously and did not enjoy it because of that.\nCan't wait for the sequel and eventual crossover with Avengers!\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12vdj2w2qq0gzmvp22nwbgimweygbt4404": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmi3PAZxTVrXIBxBU_1YZtw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "avataz", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T22:48:44.955Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCmi3PAZxTVrXIBxBU_1YZtw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.46303999999999995, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T22:48:44.955Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/107705508682199395070", "textDisplay": "Grace is getting to the point where if she hates a movie, you will probably \nlove it.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12wxteryxaxzfynn22ljzhwcmupsnpom04": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkF-SXPVtIdzwuQlwgC5hlg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eAM28Axmeas/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAG8/j-Q9BGl4TVs/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Katiecakes L", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-09-04T21:07:30.643Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCkF-SXPVtIdzwuQlwgC5hlg"}, "sentiment_score": -0.53383399999999992, "formal_score": 99, "updatedAt": "2014-09-04T21:07:30.643Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/110785375529158876819", "textDisplay": "While I agree with some points, your belief of people not liking it or \nwanting a sequel has been proven vastly wrong. \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z121zvnipxfhvxjsp233tbabhqy1v1bve": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcVBIkQyMJCumCWgmB3AiEQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "azazinate", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-01T20:47:16.135Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCcVBIkQyMJCumCWgmB3AiEQ"}, "sentiment_score": 0.26907600000000004, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-08-01T20:47:16.135Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101784318534651327137", "textDisplay": "Thank you for the review.

We don't need to know every detail \nabout a character to be entertained by them in a movie, and this movie \nplayed beautifully off of what we did learn about them. It gave some \nbeautiful insight into each of the main characters without making us wait \nyears while they set up everyone's background. Ensemble movies have done \nthis for decades before comics came along and none of them ever needed \norigins before coming together. \n Saying this film was slow paced because they had to set up back stories is \na completely ludicrous statement IMO, this films packed with humor, action, \nas well as backstory and its all balanced beautifully. This is the one film \nfrom Marvel that doesn't feel like everything else, and its a refreshing \nchange of pace.\n I don't know where you saw any romance shared between Peter and Gamora, \nfrom seeing it twice its pretty obvious that the affection was more one \nsided than anything. Peter being the flirtatious tool constantly hitting on \nGamora, and her turning him down up until the end where she gains a respect \nfor him for his bravery and heart worked great. It wasn't a comic book \nromance by any means, and was done extremely well IMO.\n Putting blame on Bautista for \"wooden\" acting pretty much misses the point \nof the character he portrayed. It obviously went way over your head, I \nguess your reflexes weren't fast enough. He's a no-nonsense, extremely \nliteral character that is only driven by revenge. His character didn't \nrequire a thespian level actor, and it was a nice surprise from what we all \nprobably thought would've been the big muscle head with no speaking roles. \nHis comedic timing was incredible and while he's not an amazing actor, he's \nnever claimed to be and the character doesn't try to be either. Saying he \ngot the role because he's just some big guy with cool tats is pretty \nsexist. If someone said Zoe Saldana got the role because of her ass that \nwould be met with some pretty heavy criticism, and its not fair to use that \nsame mentality towards Batista.\n You seem to have a problem because the villains weren't fleshed out main \ncharacters. I don't think that argument works here, not every villain needs \nto be Loki. Mystery is a good thing, we learned what was needed for the \nmovie. We don't need to see every aspect of their lives or sympathize with \nthem as a villain. Ronan was a loyal Kree citizen unhappy with the treaty, \nhe was a terrorist, do you really want to sympathize with a terrorist? It \npretty obvious they're setting Thanos up as a truly mythic creature in this \nuniverse that is feared throughout the galaxies. The constant name drops \nshowed just how well known and feared he is, and his nonchalant attitude \ntowards Ronan was a good way of showing his power IMO. It showed that he's \npowerful, and even when Ronan has the infinity stone he's not intimidated. \nThats what you need for a villain like Thanos. As for Nebula she really \nworked for me, she's a heartless, ruthless killer. It works, as for her \nanger, I'm pretty sure most of that comes from jealousy of Gamora. The line \nwhere Thanos calls Gamora his favorite daughter you can really see the \nanger and jealousy in Nebula and it was done really well.\n The end credit scene was a nice addition, this film didn't try to take \nitself too seriously, it was a fun movie that took a different direction \nthan the typical Marvel movie, which is something much needed. Marvel's \nfilms fit a mold, and this was a nice break from that mold. Its a movie set \nin space where a few stones can destroy the universe, it shouldn't be taken \nin the same direction as Cap2. People need to remember that there's no law \nthat says you need an end credit scene. They're fun little easter eggs to \nadd an extra laugh at the end of the movie. This was like the shawarma \nscene. Not everything needs to lead into the next film. Sometimes a stand \nalone film is the best approach. And out of every Marvel property, GotG was \nthe most appropriate place to add a reference like Howard the Duck in.\n I think you and a few others are far too invested into the direction \nMarvel has taken previously, and anything thats different from that \ndirection is met with resistance. Changes of pace are always welcomed and \nshouldn't be seen as a bad thing. We need diversity in the comic book genre \nor else we get the same stagnant direction that we get from Iron Man 2, \nIron Man 3, and Thor 2. Calling this film unprofessional really undermines \njust how great this movie actually is. I'm someone who's not a fan of your \ntypical Marvel Studios production, I think they're all pretty stale paint \nby numbers films that throw in easter eggs and try to paint themselves as \ndeep intellectual movies. This one offers something different and \nrefreshing\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": [{"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpviyJA-QPgiHUIiwyMNToA", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Skyebright1", "isDirected": 0, "parentId": "z12cipcrkpebzj0jg04cftibut2yi5fiqok0k", "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-07T08:47:48.240Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCpviyJA-QPgiHUIiwyMNToA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.99757412999999995, "formal_score": 0, "canRate": false, "updatedAt": "2014-08-07T08:47:48.240Z", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Gn7pVQtVnP0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGc/dmxRp-IvfxU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/101123493868754562341", "textDisplay": "great comment :)"}}]}, "z13fi5rbcqmpyz2nd23cg5gzsnbfdjbki": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 22, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNBJeHZoonozF_2B3Ym0BuQ", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.97244732576985415, "authorDisplayName": "bgkid14", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T04:09:04.688Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCNBJeHZoonozF_2B3Ym0BuQ"}, "sentiment_score": -0.058875999999999984, "formal_score": 3, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T04:09:04.688Z", "likeCount": 164, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/117764771037370556278", "textDisplay": "(Please excuse the harsh language that will be in this comment..Thank you)\n\nWHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT GRACE !!!!

He wasn't a stand out in the role, but \ncompared to trained actors he held his own.

Marvel didn't even want Thanos in the movie but James Gunn begged \nand they did the scene he's in. It's so many other points I want to make \nbut I don't feel like typing it, but let me say this.

I agree with everything \nshe had to say about Gamora, several of the characters were watered down \nlike Nebula and Thanos. Ronin was a hollow character like most of his \nfellow villains. We never got to really see what made Ronin a galactic \nthreat. I got that he was evil and dangerous more because of everyone \nelse's reactions that Ronin actually doing anything impressive. \n\nI did hate the use of so many human idioms, not the obvious stuff they take \nnote of in the movie itself, it's small things like calling Thanos \"dad\", \nvery human. I also hated this in that Green Lanterns cartoon, aliens that \nthink, talk and behave like humans... it's lazy and specious.\n\nI appreciate her concerns but I think she's being overly critical of a \nmovie that when you look at the franchise as whole, especially the films I \nlisted before, it could be worse.

He's imposing, \nhas a lot of charisma, power oozes out of him, he has his flaws, his \namazing abilities, is a genuine threat - easily the second best Marvel \nStudios villain after Loki. Nebula falls under these ranks as well. She was \njust a delight to watch, especially due to the fact that, robotic as she \nis, she lost her cool not once, but twice during the movie. Quite a sweet \nfit for Karen Gillian.\n\nSecond, Gamora was saved a grand total of one and a half times, the same \namount as any other Guardian. Once when attacked by Drax (that's the half, \nsince she proved a scene before that she could very well save herself), the \nsecond time while in space, when Star Lord gave her the mask. So for you to \nharp on that so much in the non-spoiler review, it was kind of...well, \nunnecessary. Or rather, completely unnecessary.\n\nThird, James Gunn. This is a big-budget, yet typical James Gunn film. Which \nis an enormous plus. It shows that creativity can indeed play a big role in \nthese movies. Not to mention that he used all of his Gunn staples perfectly \n- like Kaufmann, Fillion, etc.\n\nFourth, Drax. I don't know what movie you've seen, but Dave Bautista did \nhis job perfectly. He shows actual, legitimate skill in acting, and is more \nthan mere muscle of the group. His lines were delivered amazingly well \nwithin context, and even his facial expressions commandeered both laughter \nand amazement. Again, don't know if we saw two different movies or not, but \nto me, Bautista is a credible actor.\n\nAnd finally, a thought on your Captain America comment from your Top Ten \nlist. Personally, I have not turned against my love for the Avengers, or \nthe X-Men films, or even the Winter Soldier. Fans, true fans, are not \nreally that fickle. The Dark Knight comment can also be explained away with \none simple comment: upon rewatching, the three Nolan Batman movies don't \nreally hold up that well. And again, their fanbases are still strong. So I \nwould not berate people for claiming that this new movie is their favorite \njust like that.\n\nNow, none of this is meant to change your opinion, of course. Even when we \nconsider the matter that throughout your videos you tend to treat your \nopinion as undeniable fact (cases in point: David Goyer as a \nfilmmaker/story-man, the impressions on films like Thor the Dark World, \netc.) Also, this is not meant to insult you or your taste. But I should \npoint one more detail. The guys on RedLetterMedia praised this film over an \nindie feature because of the amount of fun in a comic book movie, something \nthat was sorely missing from blockbusters in general. So I will raise the \nfun in this movie to a more elevated position, almost a crucial one: this \nmovie was made to be fun, and it did it in a spectacular matter. It did not \nhave a serious undertone like The Winter Soldier, nor did it pretend to \nhave it like Nolan's Batman films.\n\nHope to hear from you via comments and to argue some more if possible. :D \ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12wcvdhckvvjpoas04cerea1zvsedr5bxc0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7zMenLvVWBS5rMC_PgxMWA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tvFX6R9AQpM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/Sgl9ZvHDBVU/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "Rene Valdez", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-02T01:13:37.091Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC7zMenLvVWBS5rMC_PgxMWA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.098975999999999953, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-02T01:13:37.091Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/112659456834516216079", "textDisplay": "First you talked bad about Pacific Rim and now Guardians of the Galaxy, \nGrace, I am really questioning your movies taste now.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z123d1rwiueyu1cso22twv4hmyaoirlvf": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOQwsLy8m_q2ScBX-JhI4Kw", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "RandomTrollAccount", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-03T09:27:10.701Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCOQwsLy8m_q2ScBX-JhI4Kw"}, "sentiment_score": -0.70117000000000007, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T09:27:10.701Z", "likeCount": 1, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/118088134596396376916", "textDisplay": "Ugh, I tried watching this.

And the movie as a whole is \nmeant to be a Fun and Colorful comicbook movie for the non comicbook fan. \nWhich I think GOTG does.\n Even with it's weaknesses I think GOTG is a better comicbook movie then \nmost, and is worth seeing on the big screen.\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12bcpxbov2gzdhw204cc5qjxo3sfdyanyg0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoyPgrXCvDM7TCEUY8QpmgA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Eo7wTbmB2Rg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/d_o-C3slJAw/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "omar dino", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-03T16:35:32.341Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCoyPgrXCvDM7TCEUY8QpmgA"}, "sentiment_score": 0.29812, "formal_score": 1, "updatedAt": "2014-08-03T16:35:32.341Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/108493695924769899146", "textDisplay": "i disagree a lot with u grace and thats weird but i still love you dont \nworry :3\ufeff"}}, "isPublic": true}, "replied_comment": []}, "z12hifqxnt30fvmya04cgfragwipw1qr4xs0k": {"main_comment": {"totalReplyCount": 0, "topLevelComment": {"snippet": {"authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQZNY7dGECLir3xpfvTN_DA", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50", "inappropriate_score": 0.0, "authorDisplayName": "LOAD", "isDirected": 0, "canRate": false, "viewerRating": "none", "publishedAt": "2014-08-01T23:24:51.763Z", "videoId": "81hBV9nMorI", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQZNY7dGECLir3xpfvTN_DA"}, "sentiment_score": -0.0095959999999999934, "formal_score": 0, "updatedAt": "2014-08-01T23:24:51.763Z", "likeCount": 0, "authorGoogleplusProfileUrl": "https://plus.google.com/102321692864447218263", "textDisplay": "Hmm...Grace, do you know that Karen Gillan is Scottish?
